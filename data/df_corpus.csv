12,I've almost finished reading my first book in over 10 years. Now looking for recommendations on what to start on next.,"Hi.

I've never really been into reading. I'd tried sporadically to pick up various fantasy novels but never got interested enough to keep it up. I just assumed reading wasn't something I'd enjoy.

Then I picked up Shogun on the recommendation of a gaming buddy of mine, and although I was apprehensive at its size, I've managed to read 3/4 in just over 2 weeks, and have loved every moment of it.

I love the rich historical setting, the character development and the clearly well researched insight into the culture of the time. I think something along these lines would be great for me.

Does anybody have a suggestion where I should start looking? I'm quite excited to have found a new hobby!

29,Controversial Medical Histories,"I'm currently reading *Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present*, by Harriet Washington. The historical portion of the books details how American doctors in the 18th and 19th centuries used slaves, as well as free African Americans, for medical experimentation, basically to test out new (often dangerous) treatments and conduct experiments on African Americans who were deemed expendable, before these treatments could be deemed safe to be practiced on white patients.

I'm interested in books that address similar topics of dubious medical practices, especially relating to experimentation on vulnerable/expendable members of society.

Of the top of my head, I've heard of Nazi doctors conducting experiments on Jews and other 'undesirable' members of the German population during the Holocaust, American psychiatrists experimenting on people that were liberally diagnosed as alcoholics or depressed and institutionalized against their wills, and more recently I've heard about ethical concerns regarding humanitarian medical missions that essentially allow young doctors to hone their skills on patients in the Third World. Any books (or journal articles too) that address any of these or related subjects would be great.

Also I'm not sure how popular non-fiction is on this subreddit, if anyone knows of any others subs that I could repost this to that'd be great too. Thanks!

My Friend A said that I should've bought black because it would've looked better, I don't make much of this and move onto celebrating.

Then my Friend B buys a car later down the line and buys a black one, my Friend A and B have a conversation about how black is the best and then I feel left out and sad about having a Silver car.

How do I not be swayed by other people's opinion and learn to appreciate my own without letting other people dictate what I like and what I buy? 

Is there a book or concept revolving around this concept?

47,Black Mirror: books that go into the current discourse on the ethics of technological proliferation,"Hi all, last week I discovered the Black Mirror series on Netflix and promptly binge watched all four seasons.

I find myself fascinated with the bleak realities portrayed in the series, most of them created or enabled by technology that fundamentally alters human interaction and institutions in ways that today would be considered dystopian. 

I wonder if there is any literature being published on the subject of ethics of this type of technology, for example the Arkangel implant. I’m really interested in literature that perhaps discussed ways in which these types of technology could be implemented without undermining our basic humanity. Obviously black mirror itself is an investigation into how not to do it (in most cases).
