12,I've almost finished reading my first book in over 10 years. Now looking for recommendations on what to start on next.,"Hi.

I've never really been into reading. I'd tried sporadically to pick up various fantasy novels but never got interested enough to keep it up. I just assumed reading wasn't something I'd enjoy.

Then I picked up Shogun on the recommendation of a gaming buddy of mine, and although I was apprehensive at its size, I've managed to read 3/4 in just over 2 weeks, and have loved every moment of it.

I love the rich historical setting, the character development and the clearly well researched insight into the culture of the time. I think something along these lines would be great for me.

Does anybody have a suggestion where I should start looking? I'm quite excited to have found a new hobby!

29,Controversial Medical Histories,"I'm currently reading *Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present*, by Harriet Washington. The historical portion of the books details how American doctors in the 18th and 19th centuries used slaves, as well as free African Americans, for medical experimentation, basically to test out new (often dangerous) treatments and conduct experiments on African Americans who were deemed expendable, before these treatments could be deemed safe to be practiced on white patients.

I'm interested in books that address similar topics of dubious medical practices, especially relating to experimentation on vulnerable/expendable members of society.

Of the top of my head, I've heard of Nazi doctors conducting experiments on Jews and other 'undesirable' members of the German population during the Holocaust, American psychiatrists experimenting on people that were liberally diagnosed as alcoholics or depressed and institutionalized against their wills, and more recently I've heard about ethical concerns regarding humanitarian medical missions that essentially allow young doctors to hone their skills on patients in the Third World. Any books (or journal articles too) that address any of these or related subjects would be great.

Also I'm not sure how popular non-fiction is on this subreddit, if anyone knows of any others subs that I could repost this to that'd be great too. Thanks!

My Friend A said that I should've bought black because it would've looked better, I don't make much of this and move onto celebrating.

Then my Friend B buys a car later down the line and buys a black one, my Friend A and B have a conversation about how black is the best and then I feel left out and sad about having a Silver car.

How do I not be swayed by other people's opinion and learn to appreciate my own without letting other people dictate what I like and what I buy?

I find myself fascinated with the bleak realities portrayed in the series, most of them created or enabled by technology that fundamentally alters human interaction and institutions in ways that today would be considered dystopian. 

I wonder if there is any literature being published on the subject of ethics of this type of technology, for example the Arkangel implant. I’m really interested in literature that perhaps discussed ways in which these types of technology could be implemented without undermining our basic humanity. Obviously black mirror itself is an investigation into how not to do it (in most cases).

56,Suggestion for Fantasy book series with Romance Subplot,"As title suggests, looking for a Fantasy book with a romance subplot. I'm very picky when it comes to the romance story. At times it may make or break the story for me if I don't like who the main character ends up with or if one of the romantic interest dies.  
Romance checklist:
-Male pov (romantic interest: female)
- From the start you have a general idea who the Main Character will end up with
- When it's all said and done They both live happily ever after. I don't think my heart can take it if one or both died lol.

If it helps, I just finished The Summoner series by Taran Matharu. I really like the relationship between Fletcher and Sylva if anyone read those books. And after doing a bit of research I've read that the Codex Alera by Jim Butcher is good and might look to reading.

Thanks for the suggestions in advance!

(2) Paragraphs, sentences.

Firstly we used the books of the Gutenberg project to populate our database, so the recommendations are mainly classical, copyright free titles.

70,"A novel dealing with coded messages, cryptology, symbology, conspiracies and secret societies?","I have a degree in English Philology, so most of what I read for many years was ""work related"" (though, of course, I loved most of it!). I lost the habit of reading for pleasure, since I didn't have the time to read (and, honestly, neither the will to sit down and read even more after having spent hours upon hours reading a certain type of literature or literary criticism/theory). Recently, I've decided to try to pick up the habit again, so I've been building up a short list of authors and genres I want to try.

A genre (or premise, rather) that I've always enjoyed is the adventure based around the decyphering of complex clues and riddles that lead to even more complex clues and mysteries. Think, for example, of Dan Brown's works (of whom I've read *Angels and Demons*, *The Da Vinci Code* and *Inferno*, but not *Origin*), the *National Treasure* movies or the crypto challenges that the Cicada 3301 group releases every year. They are not strictly detective fiction, but have a strong component of sleuthing and expert-level knowledge of history, science and art that I've always found extremely appealing... even if the novels themselves are exactly ""good"" literature.

So, I was wondering if someone could recommend me a novel along those lines? I mostly want something fun and engaging, so I don't mind recommendations of either best-sellers or hidden games that I may have missed.",52,7pwdug,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/7pwdug/a_novel_dealing_with_coded_messages_cryptology/

A Village Lost and Found. Book featuring stereographic photos from a Victorian English village. Comes with a viewer. 

This Book is a Planetarium - Pop ups including a working planetarium (using a mobile phone), a musical instrument, and a loud speaker. 

Vargic's Miscellany of Curious Maps - Has a selection of maps that fold out from the book.

I'll include the list that I've got so far but I'm looking for suggestions to flesh out the list. I've been hitting sci fi for a few years, although I really haven't been able to make much time for reading. I've read Dune, Expanse 1-6, Neuromancer, the Martian, foundation 1, ready player one, the road, and a few others. So looking for sci fi, some general classics, some philosophy, I'm up for fantasy but I'm picky about that genre. I'm shooting to keep my choices a little shorter because I read a little slower, in school, and work full time, so around 250ish pages for a maximum give or take. 

Here's my list so far:

-The art of War

-Slaughterhouse 5

-catcher in the rye

-zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance

-blood meridian

-Brave New world

-i robot

-1984

-do Android's dream of electric sheep

-american God's

-Lolita

-starship troopers

-animal farm

-notes from the underground

-thus spoke zarathustra

-catch 22

-mans search for meaning

-meditations (mercus aurelius)

-blue beard

-lord of the flies (maybe)

-Fahrenheit 451

-altered carbon

-foundation 1,2,3

-the forever war

-the little prince 

-to kill a mockingbird


If I can up my reading speed:

-Lotr books

-flowers for Algernon

-books of 5 rings (maybe)

79,I Want To Read One Book A Month,"Last month I realized that I had not read a single book in all of 2017. It made me really sad since I used to love to read, but now for whatever reason lack the motivation to pick up new books. I ended up buying myself Ready Player One as a Christmas present since I had seen the movie preview but didn't know much about it. I instantly got sucked into the world and couldn't put it down. Yeah, I know the writing and characters weren't that great, but it was an easy read, and I think some plot-driven easy reads might be what I need to get back into the swing of things.

So now I set a goal for myself to at least read one new book a month. This January I've already read Artemis which was kind of ""meh"" for me. Other books I've read in the past were: Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, The Hitchhiker's Guide, Percy Jackson, Ender's Game, and the Maze Runner (though I didn't care for that one). I've mostly read YA novels but I'd also be interested in some other styles. 

I'd love any suggestions for books that can get me back into reading without becoming too much of a chore. I'm open to any genre, though I'd prefer that they aren't extremely long.

(It may be overly ambitious.) Anyhoo, the few of us who are tuning in are on the hunt for February’s read. So Redditors, do you have any book suggestions for, preferably, an entertaining book about vices, or with a character plagued by a particularly vice. I think we’re going for some element of escapism, so a book like Leaving Las Vegas probably won’t promote much readership. But ANY suggestions are welcome!

108,Help me start reading [What/where to start],"Hello all. I'm fresh out of college and for most of my life I have considered myself a writer because I have a story I want to tell and I am a pretty decent writer. Despite that, a lot of people have given me a hard time when I tell them that I don't read. I don't read, probably, because it was forced upon me in elementary and middle school. However, I would like to start reading, but I'm just not sure where.

The story that I write, and what I assume I will enjoy, is near-future science fiction and urban fantasy with action/fight scenes and focus on characters. Last night I picked up a copy of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms by G.R.R Martin, since I enjoyed Game of Thrones and hopefully it will enjoy the book as well.

The only other thing is that I would probably want to start with a shorter book, less than 500 pages ideally. Anything over that and the idea of reading it starts to feel like a chore to me.

But for the past several years, I've been trying to read more books that are considered classics, particularly those written a while back (I haven't set a strict date range, but I aim for anything written before about 1950). 

I majored in English so I'm no stranger to reading books that aren't ""fun"" to read. But I also find a lot of people claim to have enjoyed a lot of the classics that I didn't really care for, even though I understand the appeal and the importance of those works. As much as I enjoy reading, I get burnt out pretty easily when I have to slog through dense tomes one after another.

Some examples of classics I've read and enjoyed are *The Count of Monte Cristo,* *The Great Gatsby,* *Wuthering Heights,* and *Crime and Punishment.* I'd also prefer books that aren't too long, not that they have to be incredibly short, and non-fiction books and/or historical fiction are good, too.

As i grew older i gradually stopped reading, but i really miss it. My reading-level isn’t what it used to be, i would try to read stuff i used to enjoy, but i just dont have the patience for it anymore. If it gets too complicated or philosophical I tune out. I’ve always liked sci-fi, but I find it very difficult to conjure up images of things in my head, even picturing characters is kind of difficult for me, so I struggle with a lot of fantasy where the picture that is painted of the world isn’t really detailed (which in turn easily bore me) or where the story isn’t contained to a very small space.  

I don’t enjoy the stuff I used to anymore, but I’m still stuck in that elitist mindset. This makes it hard for me to find books that click with me today. 
In movie terms; I insist on dozing off to the railroad scene in Stalker, rather than coming to terms with the fact that I'd rather just be chilling with the Toros in Bring it On. 

My main problem is that most books I pick out don’t captivate me, reading them feels like a chore, while a lot of the books that are light enough that I DO end up finishing them – I don’t like. I have read a few lighter books recently and really enjoyed them. I want to find more books who just suck me in, but this inner douche-canoe keeps interfering with my choices, and when I try as best I can to analyze WHAT about these books I liked, im at a loss, so I find it difficult to find more books like them. Maybe it’s the style of writing more than the actual story? I also seem to really like thrillers and books where there is just something eerie going on, but you don’t know what. And paragraphs. Boy, do I love lots of paragraphs.

- Call of the wild and White Fang, Jack London (loved these!)


- The Martian – Andy Weir


- A collection of short stories by Joe R. Lansdale. 


- Pastoralia – George Saunders

I've read a few books when I was in school but only because I was forced to. I don't remember any of those books besides Tartuffe and Dom Juan (I actually liked those as far as I can remember). 

After playing Stalker and then Metro 2033 I decided it was time to make the leap and finally buy a book I wanted to read so I bought Metro 2033.

I absolutely loved the book, especially the atmosphere and the way it was written, very descriptive, I really could paint images of the world the author described, for the first time I felt ""immersed"" in a book, almost as if I was ""playing it"". 

So here I am now wondering what I could pick up next. I really like it when it takes place in another world that makes sense, seeing how the whole society works in this specific world etc... 

I've heard mostly bad things about Metro 2034 but I've also seen a ton of good stuff about Roadside Picnic. 

So what should I pick up next ? I'll probably get Roadside Picnic (although I don't know if I should get Stalker or Roadside Picnic, I'm not sure of the differences between the two).

I'm looking for something in a futuristic setting (more advanced technology etc), but not too far (no galaxy wide civilizations).

I'd prefer something within realm of possibility (no crazy things like timetravel or teleportation), preferably written by someone with a good grasp of science, engineering and technology.

The thing is, majority of books in this sphere are either very dystopian or very heavy and dark. I'd like something more lighthearted, with a lot of immersion and 'atmosphere'.

(I'm not saying it has to be an ideal perfect world with only candy and butterflies - action, intrigue, death and murder are fine, as long as the whole book isn't deep into dark and depressing themes..)

I've just found out that my teenage sister is being bullied at school. I've encouraged her to read more but am pretty confident that the books I read as a teen wouldn't appeal to her. She's not much of a reader, but that's not to say she's shallow or can't appreciate a book- she just hasn't been introduced to the right ones. Not long ago, I gave her 'Journey to the Riversea' to read, which I think she enjoyed.

She's increasingly withdrawn and stays in her room. I know bullies play on one's insecurities and their antics are hard to stop thinking about, so I want to share books with her that could be a source of strength and inspiration or make her want to find a hobby she can be passionate about and give her a zest for life.

I've done a little  research and heard good things about Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series but so far she's the only mainstream bestselling author that also writes erotica that I'm aware of.  FYI: I've already struck Fifty Shades from contention because a) so many people have already read it and b) I read it and found the writing bland and the story a little boring (just my opinion).

If you have any ideas I'd love to get some suggestions.  Happy reading, everyone!

EDIT:.  Thanks for all the great suggestions, everyone, I really appreciate it.  Keep them coming!

One thing I should have said earlier is that the focus of my book club is to push boundaries and get people to read what they normally wouldn't choose on their own.  So feel free to suggest erotica across the entire spectrum, whether it be traditional couple centric, kink, bdsm, LGBT, polyamory, or a combination of all elements. 

My main goal, if possible, is to find something truly erotic with hot sex scenes that don't shy away from graphic descriptions WHILE ALSO being well written.  I've seen a few anthology selections recommended online so feel free to throw those in the mix, too.",14,7uo31x,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/7uo31x/i_run_a_book_club_and_need_help_finding_a_quality/

Hope all is well.

Recently I've been doing a lot of self-reflection and reminiscing about the past in general and just thinking about all the memories I've had thus far, with the good and the bad. Needless to say it makes me emotional (not depressed) but I know of course, new memories are to be made and new experiences are to be enjoyed. 

I'm sort of just looking for a book talking about recounting past experiences in general. For example, Mark Manson recently talks about his past life and the loss of who he was previously before he met his wife.  

""*The two people we were that night were now gone. And they would never come back. I would never get to meet my wife for the first time again. I would never get to fall wildly in love in a way that both excited and terrified me at the same time.1 There was a sweet, cocky ignorance to my younger self that has been irrevocably lost. And despite being lost for the best reasons, it still made me sad.*""


I'm not precisely sure what to even call the genre or type of feeling - maybe nostalgic but something that talks about that feeling with a new perspective? twist? Again, I know this is a shot in the dark but hey, you never know. Just something for me to get a better understanding of the feeling and also read other folks views on it.

277,Looking for book recommendations for a woman in prison,"Hi, thanks for reading.  I am looking for recommendations for books for a woman in prison.  

(Background: I have a family member in prison.  Okay, it's my sister in law.  She is in there for  drug-related crimes that she is absolutely guilty of.  Was given opportunities to improve her situation, and blew them all.  She hurt a lot of people, myself included, with lies, denials, etc. Now she is in prison for the foreseeable future.  A lot of people have given up on her, and she probably deserves it.  But I can't.  Maybe it's my personality (INFJ) but I feel bad that she's alone in there, scared and homesick, and I think her life still has value, and I have hope that this is her rock bottom and she can make self-improvements that can make her life better for when she is released). 

I am able to send her books via Amazon, so I would like to send her books.  I have my favorites (John Irving, Wally Lamb, Marian Keyes, David Sedaris, Augusten Burroughs) but I wanted to see if anybody else had any recommendations.  I know in the past she has read shorter, lighter types of books, so maybe Irving isn't the best choice.  I don't want to just impose my likes on her, and I want to send her books that she will enjoy. 

Aside from the normal prison mail rules about no metal, no hardcover, the prison says these are prohibited:

-Prohibited images or writing, such as material that contains nudity and sexually explicit images or writing, or that promotes tattooing or body piercing, violence, illegal activities, or racial and religious hatred
content focusing on weapons or explosives
-Instructions for manufacturing drugs or drug paraphernalia
-Codes
-Material that violates any DOC policy or facility-specific operational procedure     

To be clear, I am not looking for self-help books...really mostly novels, or memoirs that would leave her with a positive feeling, hope for the future, desire to make a change, to be a better person, something like that, but not self-help books.  Something with a message. Does that make sense?  But at the same time, I don't want these to be preachy books,  and I don't want to come across (to you redditors, especially, as some middle-class educated privilege bitch).  But *I* have read books (both fiction and non-fiction, like memoirs) that made me want to make changes....have an adventure, be a better person, fall ridiculously and intensely in love, etc. While she is in her prison hell (again, that she put herself in), I want her to be able to escape (figuratively, haha)  in a book and feel hope, and work on planning an improved life.  

You know what I mean right? Has a book ever changed your life? That is what I'm looking for.  Give me your top 3, or 5, or 10 books. 

I feel so lame reading back what I wrote.  But please, any and all suggestions (and I'll even let you know what she thinks of a book after she reads it if you'd like me to)....fire away!

EDIT:  If you have any recommendations for books with an instructional component, like a memoir about farming or gardening, or a fiction book about cooking, with recipes, please add those too.

It doesn't have to be books that are ALL about race or racism, but can include it as only a background theme, or if there's certain characters that reinforce negative stereotypes. So I'm looking for:

1. Mostly older novels. But also up to the 80's.

2. Something that reinforces the ideas of racism because of the authors personal biases or the culture they were raised in.

3. An author that includes racism in their novel in order to make a point and reflect the problems of the culture they're living in.

4. I need at least one female author

5. English language only, but can be from/about any culture and can reflect different versions of racism than just what has been going on in western society. But this isn't as important.

6. Something that reflects internalized racism, but this also isn't as important.

First post here.  I've had this ongoing ""relationship"" with a girl I met that just hasn't quite taken off, despite very good chemistry between us.

She was a childhood victim of sexual abuse, and her last relationship was physically/emotionally abusive.  She recently opened up to me saying that she's not good with relationships because she doesn't feel she deserves to be loved/cared about, so while she knows I genuinely care, it causes her to pull back.  I think she knows that some therapy would be helpful, but that she isn't ready for that right now.

I don't want to give her a book blatantly addressed to victims of abuse, but I'd love to find something that kinda delivers the message ""we're all damaged... you're no less of a person... here's why you still deserve love"".

320,My university team built a website that generates book recommendations based off your likes and dislikes,"Here is the link to the website: http://newvella.herokuapp.com/

(I apologize for any delay in the loading - we are running it on a free server!)

My team built this as a Capstone Project for our final year of engineering at the University of Toronto - the goal of the project is to design a novel way of serving book recommendations to readers such that they are able to better locate books which align with their interests.

I would appreciate any feedback which you may have, since we are still testing the product - thanks so much for checking it out!

PS: Some obvious downsides

* Since we are running it on a free server, our internal database only contains 1,500 books (the top 1,500 from goodreads.com)
* The website is slow to load and may take time to generate recommendations (due to the free server)
* Some of the wording is currently being changed since it is not explicit enough what is occurring on the website at various points
* Lack of FAQ (but please do ask any questions here if you have any!)

**EDIT:** Thank you guys SO MUCH for the feedback! I really do value in each and every one of you for taking the time out of your day to visit our website and leave such detailed comments - I tried to respond to as many comments as possible but do let me know if you have any additional feedback or questions

Our team will be constantly referring to this thread as we rethink our design and algorithms, so thanks for helping out!",213,7xsb6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/7xsb6n/my_university_team_built_a_website_that_generates/

I love fiction, with deep stories and even deeper characters. I love seeing characters develop, having a favorite, and growing attached to them. I like mystery genres in other media, so I would like to attempt to read more in mystery. Fantasy is great as well.

&gt;A trader arriving from Bukhara to the north-east or from Nishapur to the south-west would once have been relieved at the sight of Merv. Crisscrossed by canals and bridges, full of gardens and orchards, medieval Merv and its surrounding oasis were green and richly cultivated, a welcome reprieve from the bleakness of the Karakum desert.

&gt;When George Curzon visited the ruined city of Merv in 1888, the vision of its decay overwhelmed him. “In the midst of an absolute wilderness of crumbling brick and clay,” the future viceroy of India wrote, “the spectacle of walls, towers, ramparts and domes, stretching in bewildering confusion to the horizon, reminds us that we are in the centre of bygone greatness.”

I like this because I can read my ""side books"" a couple pages at a time if I want--it adds flexibility to my schedule i.e. I don't have to set aside a significant chunk of time if I want to just read something real quick while I'm cooking or right before bed.

It would be great to have a ""Care and Keeping of You"" for boys, that includes information about girls as well. As for the sex\-ed, something that is a good introduction that doesn't go into graphic detail would be great. He is a a bit innocent \(not completely, but still believes in Santa, for example\), so I want an intro to the topics at this point \- intros to sexual intercourse, the complex emotions associated with it, masturbation, etc.

I need a happy book that feels like summer. Something with lots of colourful descriptions of nature and the outdoors or that otherwise takes place when it’s warm out. I’d prefer something older/classic that takes place before 1950 or even in the late 1800s/early 1900s. One book I remember that kind of gave me a summery or at least naturey feeling as a kid was Heidi by Johanna Spyri. Haven’t read it in years but I just remember loving the descriptions of the mountain air and wildflowers and how characters felt stronger and happier when out and about in the mountains. 

I also like books that take place in foreign countries so maybe something that takes place somewhere warmer would do. For example, A Thousand Splendid Suns, while not very happy, spent some time describing the beauty of Afghanistan which was lovely.

419,29 year old PhD who has only read one book,"I feel like I urgently need help with learning to read.

Long story short, I'm a 29 year old comp sci. Ph.D. who loves the heck out of video games. I've been a video game enthusiast since I was five years old, and because of that obsession, I've never fostered any interest in learning to read. I've read one book in my life (Slaughterhouse-five) at the insistence of my girlfriend. All throughout school when told to 'read a book', I went to extreme efforts to fake it. I've never read a text-book, only the chapters I found relevant.

Hurtling toward 30, I'm starting to realise that this leaves a massive gap in my understanding of culture and the world at large, and feel like I need to delve into some extensive reading to get myself back on track.

I'm open to basically any form of narrative, and really want to expand my understanding of the world. I tend to find myself watching a lot of lectures and TED talks, so things along the line of personal/community/global development would definitely be up my alley.

With that said, there are a lot of books that I've had recommended to me by others as ""simple reads"" that I simply don't think I will ever be able to enjoy. Books that my peers grew up with (e.g. the Harry Potter series) sound like they were amazing to read during youth or later in life for nostalgia, but I'm a grown ass man so reading about kids going on magical adventures probably wont float my boat.

My favourite films are The Matrix and Pulp Fiction, my favourite narrative driven games are Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, and my favourite TV series are Rome and Breaking Bad.

The Shining (I pretty much stayed up all night in terror until I passed out from exhaustion. Good work, sai King)

Communion

Shout out to The Terror and Jurassic Park, which had some seriously chilling parts also. (I'm looking at you, Silence...shiver)

World War Z (this one actually had parts that creeped me out in full daylight, and I didn't think zombie stuff did it for me. Highly recommend.)

I tend to enjoy an adventure-based plot similar to the Hobbit, and I am quite keen on a large cast of characters. I do not like fantasy stories that are solely about war. I'm fine with either a dark or lighthearted story. Story does not need to contain a lot of action.  I abhor purple prose.

She knows that it snowed 2 days ago and minor stuff, but that's about it. Now she really enjoys Tyler's company but now they have no past connection so he wants to read her a book so they can make new memories.

I’m after preferably fantasy and science fiction suggestions but a good book is a good book.

504,I just read what's published in the Wayfarer series and want something similar,"Hi!

So I just finished reading the two available parts of the Wayfarers series by /u/beckychambers (""The long way to a small angry planet"" and ""A closed and common orbit""). I can't wait for the 3rd book! Now I'm looking for something similar, but let me begin by telling you what it is that I love so about the Wayfarer books.

First off, I actually consumed these books as audio books. The way they are read by Patricia Rodriguez might have added something positive to the way I perceived them. Any suggestions you make that are available as audio books by good readers will be appreciated. (Readers? Voice actors? Narrators? What's the proper word here? English isn't my native language.) Audio books means I can ""read"" while driving to work and in bed without disturbing my wife.

So, the actual books and why I love them:

* No impending doom / end of the world setting

The first thing I noticed when starting out with The Long Way was that no one was in constant peril. There are plenty of intense and exciting parts, yes, but no constant doom. There are sad parts, but they aren't the main theme. At the opposite end of the spectrum is another favourite series of mine: The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever by Stephen Donaldson. [It is the exact opposite of the Wayfarer books in this regard. Endless pain and misery, everything that you get to love at some point gets ruined and chrushed.](/spoiler) Right now I am soo tired of those kind of scenarios. It was extremely refreshing to read something that was not about constant doom but still exciting and not constantly gloomy, but still had a little sad stuff.

* There's a little romance and sexy stuff, but it's not the main theme/plot

Not much to say about that. I find the idea of Aandrisks and their way of socialising intriguing without being over the top. It doesn't feel like it was shoe-horned in there in the last minute to add sexy stuff to make the neckbeards happy. [When Sissix and Rosemary get in on was written in a way I really liked. Most of it was left to imagination, but it was still not possible to misinterpret, or written in a cringy way, or vaguely hinted with weird euphemisms. Yes, I would read the dirty fan fic if I found any, but the way it is written in the book is just perfect.](/spoiler)

* The Cameraderie

[The main characters and MOST people they meet remain reliable, without any bad kind of deceptions, treason, back-stabbing, hate (well, OK there's Corbin, but he's not secret about it and it turns out he's actually not that bad of a guy). It wasn't until near the end of the first book that I could relax a little from thinking someone would turn out to be ""evil"" and stab everyone in the back. Did I mention I'm a bit tired of the doomy/gloomy stuff?](/spoiler)

* Slice of life

These books are, as made clear in the ""no end of the world setting"" point, not about impending doom and the end of the world. To quote /u/BeckyChambers from some promo youtube clip: ""these people are not heroes"". They're about the people you see in the background on sci-fi series, the pople at the spaceports, the background crew on the space ships, the everyday people just doing their job. But in a sci-fi setting of course.

* The books aren't ABOUT politics

There's lot's of politics in the Wayfarers universe, for sure. Especially about some AI's being sentient and about their rights (or rather lack thereof) and some about disabilities, freedom of expression and whatnot. And I like it! But the books aren't ABOUT the politics. They are there as part of the world and they affect the main characters greatly, but there isn't much of political intrigues and I like that.

* The storylines of both books are related, but you can read one without the other

I guess I got tired of the 10+ books series as well. Right now I want to be able to read a book and know that there is an ending, not just a cliffhanger for the next book. I'd love it if there where 10+ Wayfarer books, because I could read one without feeling forced to read all of them at once, compared to say Wheel of time by Robert Jordan. I like those too, but it's not what I'm looking for right now.

I like fantasy and sci-fi mostly and the ""young adults"" section is usually good for me even though I'm 30+. Other stuff I like (but not necessarily the kind of books I'm looking for right now):

The Tomorrow series by John Marsden

Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan

Most books by Terry Pratchett

The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever by Stephen Donaldson

Mordant's Need by Stephen Donaldson

LOTR of course..

The foundation series by Asimov



So, based on this, could you suggest me a book please? :)

540,"Horror tips for somebody who thinks nothing scares him anymore (in horror fiction, that is)","I just found this subreddit by chance and I'm happy I did. After trying to fill in some suggestions, I have one of my own. Before you answer, please read through the short intro and look at the books I've read (both what I liked and what I didn't like) to avoid mishaps.

Throughout my life, I've had several periods where I read horror books as a means of escape. The feeling of dread because you feel there is some evil presence in your dark bedroom after finishing a particularly engrossing horror novel has always been appealing to me and so I've tried out many different authors and works. These are some of the books that managed to really scare me:

* Laird Barron (especially the story about the wood-choppers and the devil worshipping cult) 
- Clive Barker - The books of blood (the story of the two competing villages in former Yugoslavia especially made a big impression)
- HP Lovecraft (not extremely scary but loved it nonetheless)
- MR James ghost stories
- Some of Richard Matheson's works (Hell House comes to mind)
- Scott Smith - The Ruins
- Dathan Auerbach - Penpal
- Thomas Ligotti - Teatro Grottesco (although a bit too unhealthy/weird to my liking at times) 
- (update) Brian Levenson - Last Days (detective gets invited to investigate a murder inside of a dismemberment cult --&gt; very special book with an uncanny atmosphere) 

I'm not trying to make the list too long (hopefully you'll find some nice recommendations among the works mentioned) and there are quite a bit I have forgotten, but: could you please recommend something in the same vein as these books? I'm really not looking for big names (**especially** no Stephen King ; I love his work, but I've read most of them and they're not scary enough for me (or at least, most of them). Basically, I'm looking for recent horror novels/short stories or promising authors that have come out and that I've somehow overlooked. My apologies for the lengthy post, but I'm trying to be as specific as I can! Thanks in advance for any suggestions. 

* Thank you for your suggestions so far!!!! As I was reading through the responses, I remembered a book I had forgotten to mention. I'll try to update this thread with some more books I genuinely thought were scary for one reason or the other.

I hate it when a book always makes the human the inglorious hero, or the alien basically human.","I love sci-fi, but have fallen out of reading for leisure because of school and work for several years. Read a few books up this alley that have really interesting relationships between humans and aliens that don’t always have humans come out arrogantly on top, or make the alien basically human in mannerism or appearance. 
Off the top of my head, some that I have read in this vein would be works by Diane Duane (especially her YWTBAW series) and recently the Last Hour of Gann by R.Lee.Smith.

To be clear: I’m not just looking for alien/human smut, although there’s nothing wrong with that. Generally enjoy reading about how a human may interact with something of a complete different species.

573,Blood Meridian Fairy Tale,"——-Repost from r/books ——-

First off, I’d like to issue the usual apology for the possibility that this question has been asked before.

I have not been an avid reader throughout my life.  Inheriting some mild dyslexia from my mother, paired with probably some form of ADD(was never tested)...sitting down and reading a novel has never been as easy or enjoyable for me as it clearly is for others.

But I have recently been plowing through a large number of audio books due to the fact that I now have a job that requires me to spend large amounts of time on the road.  I’ve really enjoyed being able to experience all the stories that I never got to. 

My question is this:
Is there a searchable existing genre...OR are there any standalone books that can/could be described as fantasy or fairy tale or Sword &amp; Sorcery books that feel like they were written by Cormac McCarthy? 

Ive listened to most of his books now. I love his writing style.
Two books that have really stood out to me are Child of God and Blood Meridian.

Most notably, the way that he makes graphic violence and disgusting acts almost sympathetic and beautiful because of how he describes them.

Sorry that I didn’t compress this post more but I’m writing this in the passenger seat of a car with music blaring.

Blood Meridian Fairy Tale.

Do any books like this exist?

598,I have an oral exam where we have to talk about a book that has left an impact on me.,"High school student, I almost never read books. It's not because I hate it or find it boring, but because I find it very expensive and I have a lot of other hobbies that are a higher priority to me like sports and fashion. I have a few books in my house lying around which I read around 3 or 4 years ago. I have only read 2 books last year and I have forgotten the title or content because it was lent to me by my friend who is now in New Zealand.

I need a book, I can't just plug one off the bookstore and expect to like and have the will to talk about it. If you want reference to what I may like, I enjoy watching TV series like Riverdale and I used to watch anime and enjoy them, but I rarely do now. I like Kimi no Na Wa, Tokyo Ghoul, Your lie In April, Re zero a lot. I would prefer some profanity, but it's okay to not have any.

I don't know if any/many of these exist, because it seems that most people want worlds filled with magic or powers or abilities.  I don't.  I want to read about a character in a world where they are special.

For example, I am in love with Brandon Sanderson's books, but one thing I dislike about most of his high fantasy is how his books start off with a character (or only a few characters) learning they are special, but in following chapters/sequels, other characters (sometimes many, many more) with similar abilities continue to find their way into the story, where the protagonist is not really special anymore.  They are just the *most* special of the special people.

Some books that I love that fall in this realm are:

1.  Replay - Ken Grimwood (time-travel)

2.  The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August - Claire North (time-travel... although this one did turn into more of a *most* special book, the majority was not)

3.  Legion - Brandon Sanderson (Detective)

4.  The Lies of Locke Lamora - Scott Lynch (Thievery... Magic exists, but that's not the ability that makes the main character special)

5.  Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Detective)

It would be awesome if I had versions of the books that include Illustrations that showcase what is being explained alongside the story. 

**Bonus points** if there exists a version of the stories that explain the context of the story by explaining the history of Middle Earth and it's accompanying lore. Essentially, analysis that accompanies the story, so I can read the story and take a break by reading little ""facts"" or tidbits about the story-structure.


To further give an example of this, some of my favorite videos online are the videos that explain the thematic elements of movies and TV shows. An example of this can be see in the video analysis ""The Shining: Quietly Going Insane Together"" or any film, TV or literary analysis really.

728,Books for someone who feels like they can't read books anymore?,"When I was a kid, I basically did nothing but read. I'd go to the library at least once every week, and I'd have at least half a dozen books checked out at any given time. I've always been an incredibly fast reader: I rarely purchased books because I'd finish them within a few hours of buying them. I even attended a creative writing summer camp for six summers in a row.

But shortly after I started high school, I pretty much stopped reading books altogether. There were probably many factors involved (busier lifestyle, had to read other books for English class, moving to a new city with a not-great library system, nothing written for my age group really appealed to me), but by the time I finished high school I almost never read.

I'm 19 now, and I've gotten to the point that I feel like I can't read books anymore. It's not like I hate reading itself: most of my favorite video games are very story/text heavy (hell, Ace Attorney has more reading than it has actual gameplay), and I can read comics and manga just fine. But looking at pages upon pages of nothing but words stresses me out in ways that it didn't before. My inability to read slowly doesn't make me tear through books like it used to, now it just makes me feel like I'm mentally skipping ahead and missing important parts. I just want to stop feeling like an idiot who can only enjoy books with pretty pictures.

My favorite books as a kid were the Lemony Snicket series, I really enjoyed the style of the writing. I didn't really have a favorite genre, but I did read a lot of mystery-types, either straight up mystery stories or stories from other genres with mystery elements to them.

730,The Fountainhead: is it worthwhile?,"I was really excited when I picked up this book some time ago. I had never read Ayn Rand before but I had heard a lot about her. Also, I really liked other russian authors of the time (mostly Tolstoy and Dostoevsky who also indulge in philosophical fiction).I understand that their work is extremely lengthy and time consuming but it's always worth the effort.

But, halfway through ""The Fountainhead"" and I'm positively repulsed by it. For some reason I'm not able to connect with the author's thought process at all. It does not seem like the author is trying to explore a dark theme or trait of the lead characters but at the same time expound some of their extremely terrible acts (including rape) as a good /normal thing. Add to that some of the conversations between lead characters is uninspiring at best.

So I wanted to ask, should I continue to plough through the book - does it get any better or should I just quit and move to something else?

PS: I'm new here so if this is not the right place for this question, let me know.

I mean if I sit down to it I could list every book I read and it wouldn’t be too long of a list to read. The last time I was really reading I was so much younger that I wonder if I would read more if it was young adult. 

From quick memory basically I’ve read like Harry Potter. 
The summer of Dan Brown... 
some free classics like David copperfield.


I think the most recent thing I read was The Circle by Dave Eggers some time in 2013/14?
Before that I was a quarter way through The Stand. And there’s some smaller stuff along the way. 

Oh yeah. When I got my kindle (no longer have it. Wish I did) I wanted to read what was current and not just free classics, so I went to best selling, picked number one and started reading. Turns out it was hunger games so I read those. 

And I’ve also read stuff like Zone One. Because funny story my mom suggested it. I thought neat I’ll read this and we can talk about it. She reads books a week and I always wanted to read more. So I do. It was difficult. I might have been too dumb. Finally finish it and my mom says “oh yeah I only read the first chapter...” 

Anyway. Zone one was clearly a smarter person’s book. 

What on earth should I be reading. 

I started Slaughter house five. But it’s basically on my iPhone and it’s hard to want to read that way. ",26,8aia59,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/8aia59/whats_too_old_to_be_reading_young_adult/

I read a lot of action/adventure/romance fanfiction in my spare time, and I own a few books in my at home library that I re-read every now and again (Prozac nation, girl interrupted, gone girl, companions of the night, a series of unfortunate events). 

I'm looking for something with lots of character focus and internal struggle against oneself. I have to be attached to a character to care about their story. 

I don't mind dark themes and I don't mind horror. Happy/introspective reads are also nice too! I have Wild by Cheryl Strayed on hold at my library, so I feel that's a good place to start reading again, but beyond that I'm lost. I also used to read a lot of manga on the side, though I feel like I'm growing out of the genre a bit. 

Some tv shows that I enjoy that may help: Bates Motel, Crazy Ex Girlfriend, Black Mirror, The Good Place, etc

What things I liked most about the series that I want to find in your suggestions are:

- **Very strong character development.** Especially when characters who are very distinct from one another have clever storytelling that brings them together.

- **An 'underground heroes' theme.** There's got to be a big mission or conglomerate that is looming grey over society which cause a small set of heroes to want to take it down.

- **Writing that has good vocabularly, but is also not too flowery in prose.** The Steig Larsson books were sort of dry in prose, but this helped it in some ways.

Despite being in academia, I feel as though my spotty background in literature 'classics' makes me less well-rounded or knowledgable than I'd like to be.

A few examples of what sorts of things I have read: a good bit of classic science/speculative fiction, dystopian stuff, gothic literature, plays, lots of Solzhenitsyn, existentialist authors, Herman Hesse, etc.


As a few examples of what I have not read: Wuthering Heights, anything by Jane Austen, The Great Gatsby, anything by Tolstoy, anything by Nabokov, anything by Dostoevsky, anything by Virginia Woolf, anything by Kundera, etc.

Particularly, Ayobami Adebayo's ""Stay With Me"" moved me, had me shocked, smiling, in tears - all of it. I also enjoyed ""The Heart's Invisible Furies"" by John Boyne which although being a wee bit long, came with a wonderful warm, human touch and a solid portion of humour.  


Do you know of any novel - contemporary or classic, literary, general or crime fiction - which can also provide equally in: interesting plot, authentic characters but foremost of all: wit, a touch of humour &amp; leaving the reader with a feeling of having read something worthy of the time and attention? I like to be ""guided"" by the author, relying that there is a good story to tell here and a concept behind the plot.  


I am particularly open to less-known, international authors. I have loved Mariana Enriquez short-story collection ""Things We Lost In The Fire"" for example and am recommending Raphael Monthes' ""Perfect Days"" to many readers. What I am not a fan of is passive aggression or frustration which is hidden and pointed at, and leaves the reader somewhat uneasy.

955,Good books for young adult English as Second language students? How does a book club work?,"TL: DR; I want to start a book club for intermediate ESL speakers and need recommendation about writers and of interesting but easy to read books that will keep adolescents and young adults entertained.

.

Hello friendos, I confess that I'm not an avid reader, I learned English by watching TV and translating confusing grunge song lyrics from the 90's. I worked as an ESL teacher while in college a long time ago.

A few years ago I was unemployed and decided to offer ESL classes/tutoring since I had previous experience with it, this worked well for some time until good job opportunities arrived, I then decided to only work with the kids from the first small group I imparted classes to, they were 5, then 4 and ultimately 3.

It's been a few years and for the last year I stopped charging because I don't really need the extra money and I moved a bit far from them, one of them now drives the other two to my house on Saturdays, they aren't little kids anymore, one's 15 the other two, 18 and 20.

Some times we don't even have a formal class, we talk, they like to use the English they've learned, even if I don't charge I want to help them improve even more.

My wife mentioned she wanted to get into a book club and I thought that perhaps I could try to do just that, turn this weekly ""class"" into a book club.

What are some books you'd feel would work? Which writers have a straightforward but captivating way of writing that won't make them lose interest because it would become a frecuent necessity to look in the dictionary?

If you know of a book that falls into this broad category that's not aimed at young kids, it would also help.

1002,Books with a ruthless female lead and romance components.,"Ok, so I just finished the ""Imperial Radch"" Trilogy and I loved it, mostly because of the main character which was an ""Ends justify the means"" kind of woman. 
Now that I'm finished I'd like to read another book with a female lead like that, but more intense/ruthless. The best example that comes to mind is a female renegade Commander Shepard in Mass Effect. For those of you who have forgotten or who have never played Mass Effect, she's literally ok with letting a genocide continue-despite having the option to stop it- or with shooting a friend to succeed  and complete the mission succesfull.

The romance part I mentioned in the title was what I missed in the Imperial Radch trilogy, though it compensated great with complicated and interesting relationships between characters.
The romance has to be between the female lead and any other character. 

I do not care about the price or genre of the book, I'll even read pure romance as long as the female lead fits my description. 

Character development is obviously an important part of every book, so It's fine if the protagonist warms up a bit over the course of the book, as long as she doesn't turn from anti heroine to heroine completely.

I look forward to reading all of your suggestions. :)",79,8gukek,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/8gukek/books_with_a_ruthless_female_lead_and_romance/

I've always been a giant fan of books written really really well (to the point where it matters to me more than the plot - just a personal preference + academic interest). However, it's incredibly difficult to find them, especially with most books nowadays claiming to have a ""poetic"" style which usually ends up being quite generic. So I'm turning to you, dear Reddit, for further suggestions.

There are only two books I've read that I'd say *do* have a very unique, distinct style: 
Vladimir Nabokov - Lolita
Michael Ondaatje - The English Patient

I'm also a fan of modernism so I'd say most books by, say, Woolf and Faulkner also fall in this category, but maybe that has more to do with modernistic techniques than the actual style.

1044,A children's book (picture book to young adult) featuring biologically related siblings of different skin tones?,"I am working with a family where genetics has resulted in children who look quite different from each other. The mother is white (half Irish and half Italian--both of her parents were immigrants, so I'm guessing they were 100% Irish and 100%Italian, but definitely both white) and the father is half South African (black) and a quarter Chinese and a quarter Swedish. Anyway, their children range from looking ""white"" (long blond hair, blue eyes, pale skin) to having more of an Italian look (dark hair, tanner skin) to looking almost half black as well (darker skin, hair that will grow into an afro)...this has led to some confusion amongst the kids. They know they are biologically related but everyone assumes they're adopted. Some are unhappy that they don't look like their other parent. The oldest is a boy who looks the most ""black"" of any of the children and resents that he is seen differently than his ""white"" looking brothers (in terms of society at large)...this is a long shot, but are there good kids books that explore this issue? I'm mainly looking for novels, but picture books might work for the youngest...Thanks! (*I'm using ""white""/""black"" because that's how the father wrote it in his initial email.

1048,"Suggestions for slow-buildup adult romance novels similar to Pride and Prejudice, but from a contemporary perspective?","I'm such a sucker for that angsty, intense ""will they/won't they"" buildup where you're just desperately waiting for the characters to have that first touch and that first kiss, but circumstances don't allow that to happen right away. I'm not really looking for YA fiction, and I'm totally fine with sexually explicit material. I've just come across too many lately where I feel like the characters get to the sexual contact/lusty satisfaction a little faster than I'd like.

I compare my preferences to Pride and Prejudice because, as far as historical romantic literature goes, it is truly one of my favorite stories of all time. I adore the slow build, where the characters at first detest each other but later begin to show signs of interest. I love the courtship, even if sometimes it is clumsy and the man's moves are anything but ""smooth."" I just really crave a novel that will allow me to immerse myself in the angst and butterflies that come with the territory of a slow-building romance between two individuals.

I checked the archived posts related to Pride and Prejudice, but many of the suggestions were fantasy or YA. I don't mind those types of novels at all, but at the present it's not exactly what I'm looking for. Just to add, I'm fine with romance taking place in a historical time period and I'm open to those suggestions, but contemporary novels would be preferable. In terms of language style, I very much enjoy authors like Courtney Milan and Sylvia Day. But as long as the stories flow nicely, I'm not too picky.

1151,Looking for hot summer fiction... with a dark twist.,"Hi all, 

At this time of year, I adore reading fiction that takes place in summer with a ‘school’s out’ vibe. Descriptions of hot tarmac smells, stifling heat, playing in the woods, anything summer related. Then of course, terrible things happen. I particularly enjoy American-based novels and I really like it when it is based around children (but not YA), but it isn’t a necessity. 

Examples of ones I’ve enjoyed along this vein: IT (I think this is the one that triggered my love of this style), The Summer That Melted Everything by Tiffany McDaniel, The Little Friend by Donna Tartt, The Roanoke Girls by Amy Engel.

1153,I want to have a deeper understanding,"To me, it always seems like people who read books regularly seem to have a deeper understanding and grasp on life. They have more knowledge on various subjects, understand (English*) language better and just seem more ‘put together’. I don’t know how to explain fully what it is I’m trying to say and that’s part of the reason I want to get in to books. I feel like I’m missing words or something to explain to people what’s going on inside my head. 

My question is, where do I start? What sort of topics / genres should I begin with? I don’t know what interests me because I don’t read. I don’t even read the newspaper. I’m 27 and I’m the from millennial generation who relies heavily on the internet - like right now. But I don’t even really read anything online, I phase out when I’m faced with more than a few paragraphs. Or when I do read something like a Wikipedia page about history or something, I don’t retain the knowledge. It’s like it doesn’t register or save, or I go to sleep and someone deletes browsing history from my brain. 

This maybe makes zero sense but hopefully some of you clever book worms understand what I’m trying to say and can advise. 

*or whichever language they speak, just using English as its relative to me and this post.

1154,A book like Dune by Frank Herbert for the high level of self-awareness of its characters?,"I read it a long time ago and stopped reading fiction not long after that. I loved the whole series. What I loved was not particularly the world itself, but the heightened sense of self-awareness that Paul and other characters had. How they can be aware of their emotions and make smart decisions with distance (fear mantra for example). I might be wrong but I read somewhere that Herbert was a psychoanalyst amongst other things, that might be why.

It doesn't have to be sci-fi at all. Maybe another book written by a psychoanalyst?

1169,"Fantasy, historical or paranormal novels where female protag embraces traditional role and is strong without having to be a warrior","I'm getting sick of the 'young woman chafes at female role in medieval society and wants to stabby stab with swords like men instead because embroidery is lame and women are useless!' trope.

I love how Sansa is realizing what power she has politically in the GoT show and is wielding it as part of her own adventure. She doesn't have to be an Arya to be awesome.

I absolutely love Sherwood Smith's Crown Duel duology, where the first book is the trope where they overthrow the evil ruler and the second is about the heroine adjusting to court life and finding out that women really do have power and can help people and aren't just all shallow, vapid, glorified clothes hangers.

I'm also in love with Jacqueline Carey's first Kushiel trilogy. The closest Phedre gets to fighting with pointy pieces of metal is stabbing someone with a sharp hairpin, and Melisande is #lifegoals.

Bonus points for protags like this in paranormal romance - every female protag thinks running headlong into a fight makes them strong and interesting.

1200,Searching for good (preferably fantasy) Romance books,"So, I am delving into the romance genre. I can find many books from other genres (recent novels I enjoyed were Vicious by V. E. Schwab and the Mistborn books) but even though I love romance I can't seem to find stories that I like. You're my last hope, reddit. 

I like medieval and fantasy settings, though I am not too sure how I feel about supernatural races, especially vampires. If they lean towards being creepy in a horror setting I can be fine with those. 
After too many comparisons with hairy animals that shit in the woods and mentions of unscientific alpha/beta/omega social dynamics I fear I am quite done with werewolf stories... Unless someone can recommend one that's not about weirdly possessive one-step-away-from-peeing-on-protagonist behavior. 
That also counts for humans. 

Sadly I seem to prefer the calm, level-headed side characters to the often incredibly childish and rude main characters. If you know of any book that has the main character fall for the reasonable guy and not the brooding fucknugget, please tell me. 

Gender and orientation of the protagonist don't matter. Not having a predictable love triangle is important, though (heck, if you gave me a book with a broody girl and two guys who decide that they're better off dating each other than her I'd read it). Cheating is also a no-no. Sex scenes are totally fine, rape less so. 

If possible I'd rather read adult books, though if it's well-written I will try young adult.

I have tried all my usual hobbies and nothing is hitting this desire I have for a story that can really really fuck with my head and completely mess with my perceptions of what the story is.

About the closest things I've been able to find are Paprika and Perfect blue, 2 anime movies by the director satoshi kon. They are both very psychological movies that deal with the mind a lot and they kind of lead you into this feeling like you have a grasp on whats going on and the moment you feel that way they shift completely and make you realize it was all fake, or a dream or whatever.

I really want a book that can really twist my brain around like a pretzel and just completely subverts my expectations of where its going.

Major major bonus points if its a really psychological or spiritual heavy book (not religious, really, I want something completely new a different from the standard religions and such) 

I'm sure its a hard task, I can't imagine many authors being talented enough (or crazy enough) to be able to do something like this and pull it off well and make it understandable and readable. But if anyone knows of such a book, please let me know! Thank you :D",12,8mo57p,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/8mo57p/looking_for_a_book_that_will_really_mess_with_my/

1231,(Cognitive) science books by women,"I am reading more non-fiction this year than I have in the past and I'm enjoying it - mostly pop-science books on psychology, language, and cognition. I'd like to read science books by women, as I'm a woman and a scientist, but I can't figure out a search method that will give me a deep, long list and not just a handful of bestsellers (mostly by Mary Roach).

 I'm most interested in cognition and language, but I'm open to other science-y non-fiction, especially involving ecology, oceans/sea life, futurism, evolution, education policy, urban planning, and reading/libraries. 

I like detailed, scientific, research-based books - I'd prefer a book that was overly academic and jargon-y to one that reads like a padded-out Wikipedia page. 

**Books I've read and enjoyed:**

David Kahneman's ""Thinking Fast and Slow""

Michio Kaku's ""What Does the Future Look Like""

Jane Jacobs's ""The Death and Life of Great American Cities""

Jonathan Kozol's ""Shame of the Nation""

**Authors I didn't like:**

Yuval Noah Harari - jumped to wild conclusions based on mis-
interpretations of research and presented the conclusions as fact

Mary Roach - realized after one chapter that I wasn't super interested in a book-long description of the digestive system; I might try Packing for Mars

Sy Montgomery's ""Soul of an Octopus"" - I really really really want a good book about cephalopod cognition and this is not it. It's a wildlife book, not a science book. I've heard similar things about ""Other Minds"" by Peter Godfrey-Smith, so I'm hoping for another option.

Marilyn Johnson's ""This Book is Overdue"" - I liked parts of this one, but overall it was a very light, fluffy treatment of librarians and libraries that constantly relied on jokes and stereotypes of librarians as stuffy old ladies, like Johnson was astounded that the jokes weren't true and she was the first person to ever realize that.",28,8mtxu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/8mtxu7/cognitive_science_books_by_women/

What are some books you feel every high schooler should read at least once?","Hi, to expand upon my title, I've been homeschooled for a good chunk of high school. I mostly focused on Math and Science, not as much literature. I was wondering what books you feel should be read in high school, and what books are just good for someone my age to read? I'll list some of what I have read below.

Middle School: (aka, books I have read, but don't remember all that well. If you want to recommend I read one of these more in depth, now that I can better understand, feel free)

- Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes
- The Iliad 
- The Odyssey
- Beowulf (Didn't enjoy this one as much)
- An American Plague
- Ender's Game (I enjoyed this one a lot)
- Aeneid
- Gawain and the Green Night
- The Canterbury Tales (I also didn't really like these)
- Dante's Inferno (Didn't really understand this one at age 12, might go back to it anyways)
- Various Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology (Mythology was my favorite as a kid)

High School: (aka, books I do remember pretty well, but mostly skimmed. Again, if you want to recommend I read one of these again, go for it)

- Macbeth
- Hamlet (I liked Hamlet more than Macbeth, but both were enjoyable)
- Things Fall Apart
- Lord of the Flies
- Frankenstein (Really enjoyed this one)
- Great Expectations

These are just the books I can remember reading, but anything I missed was probably not well-known anyways. I also read a lot of poetry by many poets, which I will not include. Overall, I haven't read many of the classics at all, and would like to become more well versed in them. If you feel like it, I'd also like to know if there are any popular/classic books that were overrated/I shouldn't waste time on.

1397,Character heavy fantasy. I've read and re-read my entire Kindle library and I need help,"
Generally speaking, anything heavily character driven + fantasy oils my reading gears. 

I thoroughly enjoy the Harry Potter-esque sense of discovery, where the protagonist learns about the books universe, instead of just having it all thrown in my head at once. This works so great in tandem with a point of view that makes it easy to relate to the main character, and with some great character progression. I think Patrick Rothfuss does this really well in The Kingkiller Chronicles for instance. 

Books i absolutely love:

* I've been in an urban fantasy binge for the last couple of months, rereading the entire Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher - absolutely some of my favorite books. Other urban fantasy I enjoyed includes: Sandman Slim, Rivers of London, kinda liked the Bobby Dollar series. 
* Kingkiller Chronicles, which is an obvious thing for a list like this. Patrick Rothfuss gets a lot of hate for his slow writing, but his attention to detail is really astonishing. Also, I feel his hard magic system and his character building is one of the best out there. 
* The Gentlemen Bastards triology. Just so good, the thieving fantasy world by Scott Lynch with its great characters really talks to me. 
* Anything Brandon Sanderson - The Stormlight Archive and Mistborn in particular, but things like Elantris and The Reckoners are good too. 
* I just finished book 5 in the Cradle series by Will Wight. I liked it so much, I even took my chance going into the hell that is Xianxia/Wuxia translations just because I wanted more of the power progression/main character discovers his power kind of thing, and also the ancient-asian vibe was really cool. But the horrible English and writing of most of the translations threw me off. If anyone has anything like Cradle (not a web comic though), that would be really awesome. 
* Brent Weeks' Lightbringer series was great too. I read the Night Angel series by him too, which was good, but I feel like it pales a bit next to Lightbringer. 
* Quirky and brilliant writing ala Neil Gaiman - American gods is a favorite, but also The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Neverwhere and Stardust.
* Of course all things Terry Pratchett, although he does trend to throw the world in your head and let you deal with it yourself. (but wasn't Good Omens just an amazing book?)
* A bit out of bunds for this post, but the amazing writing of Douglas Adams in The Hitchhicker's Guide is in my opinion absolutely perfect.
* Classics like LOTR are, of course, also up there, although it is not what I'm looking for right now.


Codex Alera by Jim Butcher is a really good series too - I read through the entire thing in under a week.
After finishing that, I tried the Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne - it scratched the Jim Butcher itch a bit, but felt too much like a rip-off Dresden Files. 

I also recently finished The Keys to the Kingdom series by Garth Nix, which was really great - and his Old Kingdom series which I liked too. He tells a great story without having to overcomplicate it. 

Some of the more famous books that i didn't really like:
* GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire. Too man perspektiver for my liking, although I did make it through the books released so far. 
* The Wheel of Time. Just a bit too High fantasy for my liking.
* Joe Abercrombie's writing never really caught me, though I don't know why. 
* I can't seem to get into Robin Hobbs Farseer series. His worldbuilding doesn't really appeal to me unfortunately. 

I've read a lot of YA as a teen and I'm still not above reading that from time to time. Sci-fi I can do too, but only if it is really good and not too cliché-y. 

Hope somebody has a good suggestion or two. Failing that, I hope some of you can use a few of the books in my post as recommendation.

1416,A dark page-turner to help build a reading habit,"Hi all,

I play a lot of games (usually story-driven) and watch a lot of TV shows and movies. But I want to read more, and I’m hoping for some recommendations to get the fire going. When I’m choosing I tend to gravitate towards things I’ve seen (and liked) movie adaptations of, which usually means I am filling in rather than experiencing a new story. 

So, all recommendations are welcome. Preferably I’d like standalone novels, not part of a series. I tend to enjoy dark subject matter, but I’m open to anything compelling. I’m also 32, in case it’s relevant. Here are some books I’ve read and enjoyed:

* The Warhammer 40,000: Eisenhorn trilogy by Dan Abnett (These are my favourite books, absolutely loved them. Can’t fault them. But I’d like something standalone, not set in the Warhammer universe.)
* Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy (I really enjoyed this, but it is also ‘slow’. Not a bad thing, but I’m looking for something that moves forward faster.)
* No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy (Loved this, though still not as pace-y as I’m after.)
* The Hunger Games trilogy (I read them quite awhile ago after watching the first movie, and found them fairly easy to read and reasonably compelling. Could do without the teen romance aspect (with no judgement of people who enjoy it!).)
* Teatro Grottesco by Thomas Ligotti (Some of the stories in here were great. Though I’m looking for a novel rather than short stories.)
* Killing Floor by Lee Child (First Jack Reacher book, good fun!)
* The Secret History by Donna Tartt (Overall I really liked this, but felt it was much too long. What was good was excellent, but there felt like large chunks that didn’t seem to progress or service anything.)
* Boomsday by Christopher Buckley (This was funny, I liked it. Though only here just in case, as it’s not really what I’m after.)

And a few of my favourite games:

* Max Payne 3
* Alan Wake
* The Order: 1886
* Dark Souls
* Darksiders
* Watch Dogs
* Assassin’s Creed: Unity
* Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days

And a few of my favourite movies:

* Inherent Vice
* Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
* Funny Games
* Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
* The Mist
* Coherence
* The Eyes of My Mother
* A Perfect Day
* Gone Girl
* The Lord of the Rings Extended Trilogy ",11,8rxv0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/8rxv0n/a_dark_pageturner_to_help_build_a_reading_habit/

1421,Classical literature with focus on personality and character.,"My all time favourites include _The Great Gatsby_ and _The Stranger_, for they have plots that reflect the main characters rather than containing characters that are overcome by a plot.


The consequence of this is that personality takes priority over plot in terms of depth and meaning for me to analyse. That's why I loved those books! Meursault is the prototype for Camus' philosophy (I study the stuff), and Gatsby, although criminal and delusional, was terminally loving and respectful with genuine intent.


They give so much exposition that a reader can learn from.

I find it very confusing, multiple characters and poetic, cryptic language, multiple points of view etc. I really have a hard time following things without visual clues. 

I'm not unintelligent in general or snobby about fiction, I just find it a struggle and so consume my fiction in visual formats like films. I've read hundreds of non fiction over the years but about 5 fiction books in full.

1431,What do you think about the idea of reading two (read: multiple) books simultaneously?,"Hey there! Only before a month have I gotten into the habit of reading and set myself a target to read 25 books by the end of 2018. So far, I’ve been able to read 12 books in 40 days.

Now I’m looking to read relatively longer books, and in particular non-fiction. But I’m worried about the possibility of getting bored with the monotony of the non-fiction books (correct me if I’m wrong), which is why am I planning to also read a shorter, light-hearted book alongside. I’d be glad to hear your opinions. 

Right now on my list, I have Bill Bryson’s *A Short History of Nearly Everything* and Yuval Noah Hazari’s *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* for non-fiction. Help me pick one, and also do drop your suggestions/ideas as to what can be a better approach to reading. 

Here’s the list of books (and my ratings) I have been able to read over the past 40 days. 

1. *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything* by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner (5/5)
2. *The Time Machine* by HG Wells (3/5)
3. *The Diary of a Young Girl* by Anne Frank (4/5)
4. *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho (5/5)
5. *Blink* by Malcolm Gladwell (3/5)
6. *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams (5/5)
7. *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* by Douglas Adams (4/5)
8. *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck* by Mark Manson (3/5)
9. *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury (5/5)
10. *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini (5/5)
11. *Tuesdays with Morrie* by Mitch Albom (3/5)
12. *The Little Prince* by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (4/5)",14,8sfznc,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/8sfznc/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_of_reading_two/
1432,Any good dystopian books?,"Hi everyone, I was searching on Google for any good booklits about dystopians novels, comics, short storys, or anything similar really. But when I go to the reviews they seem somewhat artificial, not sincere enough, they seem like they're premiering a product but not actually discussing the thing in question.

To put it bluntly I value my time and my experience reading. What I look for in a book is to learn something new and see the world in a different light. What Im seeking for any story is a good use of imagination and world building. I'm really into action but besides that I don't care about tbe genre, it can be fantasy, scify, I don't care! It just has to have a good dystopian plot.

Until now I have read:

1984

Hunger games

Fahrenheit 104

This one was my least favorite

I'm one of those fellow cases of ""read a lot as a child but since high school and college started I haven't read for fun in years"". I'm really trying to get back into reading regularly, and don't know where to start since all my favorite books from my prime years of reading are YA and tween novels. 

For reference, I'm a 19 yo girl, and some of my favorites are The Book Thief, Call Me By Your Name, All the Light We Cannot See, and The Road. I'm super into books that have super amazing descriptive prose, the kind that feels more like poetry than fiction, if you know what I mean? Not sure if that makes sense. I also really love WWI or WWII era fiction, anything that touches on philosophical concepts (think The Stranger), makes the reader ask questions about the human mind or society as a whole (think 1984), books where characters have to deal with hardcore moral/ethical choices, or where the main character has a ""coming of age"" character arc in some way. Basically, if a book can mindfuck me or punch me in the heart, I wanna read it. 

I don't usually like horror, thrillers, or mysteries, (but i'm open to reading them, if they're that good) and I'll read romance occasionally, just as long as it's not cliche. I usually prefer romance to be subplots rather than main plots, but again, i'm open to reading romance, if its super good. 

 the only thing i'd really prefer to not be suggested is YA books, since i've pretty much grown out of that demographic.

Some other authors I've read recently and enjoyed: Murakami, Paul Auster, Michel Houellebecq -- all of these *sometimes* touch philosophical ideas. In terms of novels that demonstrate what I'm talking about: Fight Club and Ishamel are good examples.

That being said, after looking around an online store I noticed how huge the american comic selection is. I said to myself as I searched around ""wow they must have something that's my cup of tea.""

Dark Knights Metal. I was recommended this series by someone so I gave it a try. The art style and full coloring of all the pages(is this normal for american comics?), all the Japanese manga I read don't have fully colored pages. The problem I have with Dark Knight Metal(DC) and I assume the same for Marvel. I found myself having to do a lot of research on every character. They all have huge back stories and different versions of themselves that I found to be very intimidating. I couldn't fully enjoy Dark Knights Metal because I didn't fully understand every character. It's not DCs fault, but rather my own.

Manga that really capture me are ones that have competition, tournaments and rivals. Writers that don't reveal powerful characters right away drive me crazy!

Anyways, for a while I’ve been trying to get into the genre again, but I’m having a hard time finding a book that interests me.

What I’m looking for is a book where the main character is surviving a post-apocalyptic situation, in a smart, realistic way. I’m tired of having to scratch my head at how stupid characters are. I want the character I’m reading about to make smart decisions, be resourceful, make the most of what they’ve got, etc. 

A couple of examples would be that I loved the Ashfall series (though I never finished book 3) and, although it’s not quite post-apocalyptic, I loved the Divided We Fall series (never read book 3 though). What these two series had in common was the resourcefulness and creativity both main characters used to survive.

1547,An odd request. Hard to describe. No specific genre requested.,"So, this is a really odd request. As a child, I was always fascinated with books that broke the norm of what books are usually are. I never really knew if it were a genre in and of its own, but books that broke the fourth wall (or at least between narrator and character/audience, books that are ""found data"" or ""scrap-booked together"" always piqued my interest. However, as I have grown I can't seem to find many books that fit this profile. I'll post some childhood books, and the few that I have now that fit this mould. I know it's not a lot to work with, but I'd love to hear any recommendations. Bonus points for inserts.  


Books that have fit the mould:

* Little Fish by Ramsey Beyer
* The Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.
* The Secret Series by Pseudonymous Bosch
* Roger Saves Christmas by Roddy Doyle
* The Wayside Series by Louis Sachar
* Illuminae by  Amie Kaufman
* Ship of Theseus by JJ Abrams

I am a 17 years old highschool pupil, I was born in Serbia, I live in Serbia and I think this thread/post might be a little longer... Also, it might be a bit messy and grammatically incorrect here and there, since English is my second language.

Anyways, today I am visiting this sub in search for free or cheap books that I can find online, since, as you can induce from the title, I want to start reading more often. It may help me improve my attention/focus or like... the flow of my mind and my thoughts, but also my knowledge of English. 

Furthermore, I hope that I can find books that are related to PSYCHOLOGY. This is probably the most important detail I will give regarding the book I am searching for. After I finish highschool(I got 1 more year left), I am planning to study Psychology on a college/faculty. And for that, I will need to get best possible results on 'the Entrance Exam', for which I want to start studying ASAP. 

Some other topics that I would like to explore are things I could use when I get older: money management, businesses, communication, social skills, general life things, life lessons and also motivational stuff. Then, something I can imagine to be entertaining: (social) games, gambling, astrology and zodiac signs, body building or fitness advices, traveling and fashion tips.

I'm not the most feminine myself and often wish I was, and I love other women dearly but don't always relate well to femininity. I liked that post for giving me a broader pool of feminine experiences to use to better empathize with other women. I want the same thing, but for men this time.


There was a comment about Fight Club and toxic/normal masculinity, and it got me thinking I'd also like some suggestions of books that have helped others understand their own masculinity, that have given a good look into the ways men in our culture are raised, their feelings, expectations, conflicts, and so on.


I think I've shied away from the genre in the past because I don't know where to look for a male perspective that isn't, frankly, a war story. I'm not against war stories and no doubt many men growing up and writing in the last century were directly affected by war, but since there are so many famous examples I'd like this post to primarily seek out non-war perspectives.


I really don't think men and women are that different and I don't struggle to understand men as a whole. I just want a wider pool of male perspectives, since I'm not a man and I don't want to build my understanding and empathy for men off of media tropes or anything else that isn't straight from the (male) horse's mouth. What is a book that can give me insight into the ways boys have expectations of masculinity pushed upon them? The ways they are positively and negatively affected? Stories about men who have struggled with their place in those expectations?

1628,Hidden Civilization/Subterranean Sci-Fi/Conspiracy Thriller/Bioshock-esque novels?,"Hello, fellow bookworms of Reddit!

Today I come to you looking for novels of a certain genre, or may I say of a certain mood/""atmosphere.""

When I was a kid (late elementary school) the Tunnels series written by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams first came out. After reading the first book I was hooked and followed the series until 2012. For those familiar with the books, you will know what I mean when I say that they gave me the chills wondering about what hidden enemy could be lurking in plain sight. It was a (dare I say) slenderman sort of feel, but on a societal level. Ever since then I have wanted to read another story like it, but have come up empty-handed. 

Then I discovered the game Bioshock, which had the best elements of what I loved in the Tunnels series mixed with more philosophy. I realized then I wanted to find something of a similar nature, but each time came up with nothing.

A day or two ago a good friend of mine introduced me to the YouTube channel Night Mind and the story of NOC-10. This too I consider being of this indescribable genre I am looking for. 

Lastly, I also enjoy when stories like this embody some sort of powerful AI or Lovecraftian horror, which allows one to contemplate how little they actually know about reality.

I ask you kind Redditors, what type of genre is this? Or at least can you recommend me some books with the same feel?

1689,More stuff like Watchmen by Alan Moore? (Doesnt have to be comics.),"I liked that it had all those aspects: political, philosophical, sexual, psychological.

I liked the ambience, the feel of it all. The comic is dark and gritty, but in a warranted sense. Its trying to show the world for what it is.

I liked the presence of that sort of global crisis and tension between nations--fear, distrust, uncertainty, paranoia, so on.

Most importantly, I liked that it was this really silly premise, yet still managing to ground it to reality and find a sympathetic sadness there, all whilst also bringing all of this profound meditation. Its about these superheroes but really its about everything--all-encompassing.

The only other thing I can think of that meets most of these criteria is Don Coscarelli's Bubba Ho-Tep (2002).

Other works by Alan Moore is a given; Im reading those now.

1690,Rigorously-researched nonfiction books about topics that are commonly misconceived by the public?,"I recently read Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and One Scholar's Search for Justice by Alice Dreger. She's a historian of science who chronicled the unfolding of several highly controversial topics in the media and how censorship and a desire to drive a particular public narrative have caused perceptions of these topics to become disconnected from the facts. What I really appreciated apart from her thorough research and interviews was her ability to admit her own biases and her ability to have her mind changed by the facts she uncovered. She also did a great job of describing the same stories from multiple perspectives without making it sound like any one person was the unsung hero or vilifying the others.

1692,Looking for a mind boggling murder mystery book that can be solved by the reader,"So I recently finished the sound novel series called ""Umineko: When They Cry"" and really enjoyed it. Since it's not a book, I doubt many people here have ever heard of it, so I'll give a brief description of how it went. 

Basically 18 people get stuck on an island and a supposed 'witch' is slowly killing everyone off in crazy ways that appear to be physically impossible for a human to commit without the use of magic. Things like closed rooms, proven alibi's for everyone present, and bodies being moved from one place to another in the blink of an eye all take place and have a logical explanation at the end. The 'witch' then confronts the main character and challenges him to solve her murders with methods that are possible for a human, but to counter his theories she is allowed to fight back by speaking in red text. Everything said with the red text is an absolute truth that cannot be denied, and this is used to completely debunk all the proposed theories on how the murders took place. There's alot more to it but I'll leave it here so this post isn't too long.

So yeah, I'm currently reading Agatha Christie's books and looking for something that has crazy explainable chain murders that are possible for the reader to solve before finishing the book. If there's anything where the murder claims to be some sort of supernatural entity, I will defiantly be interested, but I'm still interested in other murder books that are hard to explain.

Just thought I'd add, I've already read ""And Then There Were None"" and it's pretty much exactly what I'm looking for.

Thanks for reading this and I will be happy to see what you guys suggest! :D

It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away.

1733,King of the Mall - My 10-year-old cousin and her dad wrote an awesome children's book based on her childhood bedtime stories!,"Hey everyone,

So my 10-year-old cousin just published a book she co-authored with her dad and to say i'm proud of her is an understatement. The book is a really cool and unique story about a bird who safely grew up inside a shopping mall who is forced to take the big risk of going outside for the first time. The book is designed to teach kids about the importance of taking risks and living life to the fullest! 

But to me, the best part of this book is where the idea came from. My uncle began telling this tale to my cousin as a bed time story when she was only 4 years old. As my cousin got older, she began coming up with her own ideas and adding to the story herself. From then on, bedtime became a collaborative storytelling adventure between father and daughter. Recently, she put the book's lesson into practice as they decided to take the risk of publishing the story so other kids can enjoy it with their parents! 

If you guys want to hear the story yourselves you can buy it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/King-Mall-Jeff-Miller/dp/1543936644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532644585&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=king+of+the+mall) or [BookBaby.com](https://store.bookbaby.com/book/king-of-the-Mall).

I used to really like reading as a kid. My dad was a huge book nut, and that sort of rubbed off onto me. I never actually read the Warrior Cats books, even though several of my friends were into them, which is part of the reason why I want to read them now. I unfortunately stopped reading quite so frequently a few years ago, only reading the books I've been required to in school. The last book I read front to back on my own was almost a year ago.

Over the next two days, I'm staying at my step-mom's house to dogsit for her. My step-sister, who's 13 years old, owns every one of the Warrior Cats books. Seeing as I left the other book I was reading at home, I was thinking about highjacking those books to read. However, I'm concerned that, since they're aimed at such a younger demographic, they won't be satisfying for me to read.

1776,"Looking for a book (preferably a novel) whose plot isn't grounded in reality but is solid, meaningful and readable (no Finnegans Wake stuff)","I love surreal literature, but most of the books of this genre I tried to tackle totally went off the rails with incomprehensible mumbling presented as ""intellectual"" (and some people even accused me that I was ""small-minded"" and ""unimaginative"" for not being able to **enjoy** something as horrific as *The Soft Machine*). By ""readable"" I mean consisting of sentences, that everyone that learned how to read would be able to understand word-by-word, even if they don't *get* the message of the sentence as a whole (so no language-warping crap — I'm looking at you, Joyce — or word-mashing — I'm looking at you, William Burroughs).

I am looking for a novel, which can merit itself by its own plot: it *can* be confusing, it *can* be hard to understand, but it has to follow a certain trajectory that concludes nicely in the end. An example of such a brilliant work is *The Library of Babel* by Jorge Luis Borges (*The Circular Ruins* and *The Lottery in Babylon* by him are also great). I always admired the approach of ""describable weirdness""; this is a method through which the author presents a certain concept, which need not be strictly defined (and therefore stresses its surreal essence even more) but is represented by something completely alien (to us)... And in the midst of all this chaos, the truth is presented.

For my taste, *The Library of Babel* is a tad bit *too* reminiscent of reality. I'd like to embark on a metaphysical journey which will take my imagination to a whole new level, and will subsequently lead me to wonderful and most importantly, *supremely weird* realisations. It's one thing to delve into the incredibly dark and disturbing parts of one's mind (*The Soft Machine*) and create a *wow* effect by how disturbing your flow of consciousness really is, but it's another to manage to present meaning amidst the seemingly impenetrable veil of chaos, randomness and weirdness. *That's* the king of a book I'm looking for.

1822,33yo Book Virgin’s first book suggestion.,"So I just turned 33 last week and I realized that I have never read an entire book before.  I have a masters degree in accounting and I am also a surgical neurophysiologist (long story).   Obviously I spent a long time in school and if I ever had time to read a book it was a textbook.   I’ve started some books while I was on summer breaks but I would lose track of the storyline after a few nights of binge drinking.  I couldn’t bring myself to go back and reread what I already conquered.  I’m pretty sure I hate reading.  Maybe that’s because it was always for school and, as a result of my procrastinating, I usually read those textbooks under the pressure of a deadline/exam.  Now, I want to read a book for entertainment.  

The readers in my life ask the same question when I ask for their suggestion of a book: What kind of books do you like?  I couldn’t tell them or you.  What I can do is tell you what movies I like and dislike.

I like movies that give me an escape from reality like post-apocalyptic survival, adventures, fantasy, and dark themes.  LOTR, Dark Crystal, I am Legend, Resident Evil, Day After Tomorrow, Armageddon, Westworld, Game of Thrones, Handmaids Tale

I dislike stories that highlight the bad things that exist in reality like mobs, mafia, bad cops, criminals, spies, court cases, and email servers.

1824,"Dark Fantasy with absolute scum-of-the-earth cast of characters, but also with an interesting twist on the morality of their actions.","I had this idea for a Psychological/Dark Fantasy story concept in my head for a while and I was wondering whether or not something like it, or close enough to it, exists.

The idea is as follows:

A character-driven narrative, centered around characters, who (in the eye of a regular person) are absolutely irredeemable, scum-of-the-earth, type of people - sociopathic murderers, rapists, folks with all of the... less pleasant types of *-philia* etc. Basically, a cast of consisting of the worst of the worst. The thing is, the book does an interesting twist on morality in the context of the story, in order not to make everything one-sided and those characters inherently evil, but rather morally gray, with their actions' credibility depending more on the context of the situation rather than a preconceived morality system - sometimes their ""evil"" deeds are entirely justifiable and the most logical solution, while in other it's just them feeding their metaphorical inner demons and trying to justify it in front of themselves.

1830,Be the change of my life.,"Hello everyone,

I just turned 20 for 3 months. I am looking for a book that would help me to find myself again. 

I have been struggling with mental illness for almost 7 years now. I went from a person with top potential to something else. I don't even regconize myself sometimes. When someone asked me 'do you not realize how much you have changed?', I just cried, I mean how could I tell? I haven't seen myself in years. Everyday waking up it was just another 24 hours for me to throw myself into another vortex of bad decisions. I don't think I am function as a normal human anymore. 

Today, talking to an old friend I haven't met in years. I asked him if I really changed, and he told me: ""You have always been you. You have always been this person drifting off from the rest - in every sense. You were always different. Just that now you're lost. Just that now you're more lost than ever. Everyone around you, everyone who loves you, even if they chase after you with all their strength in the slightest hope to pull you out of the pit you throw yourself into, they can't. They never can. Because the more they follow, the more you're running away further into the void. I don't know if it was your intention, or you're too lost you don't know what you're doing.But I guess, the decision is yours after all."" 

I'm writing this in the hope to come across a book suggestion for something that might shed a light again to my mind, and maybe during that spark I would be able to catch a glimpse of myself again, my identity, my values, my thoughts, just an idea of me. If you ever read something that shakes you up, changes you, changes your life, gives you an idea about anything, etc., please let me know. Thank you everyone :) I'm happy I came across this sub!

1897,Beautifully written horror,"To me, horror is the scariest when it's written in a style the belies the grotesquerie of the material itself. Writers like Clive Barker and Thomas Ligotti poetically describe gruesome and horrifying things as if they not only experienced these things themselves, but had time to observe and reflect upon them. It never fails to impress me just how real and visceral it all feels while reading their work, and I was wondering what other authors made you feel the same way?

Some authors I already plan to try are Laird Barron, Cormac McCarthy, Jack Ketchum, Mark Danielewski, John Langan, Paul Tremblay, Arthur Machen, Peter Watts (more sci-fi than horror), Harlan Ellison, Dan Simmons, Algernon Blackwood, Jac Jemc, and China Mieville.

I've already tried H.P. Lovecraft and Jeff VanderMeer and think they fit the bill.

I'm a Stephen King fan, but I don't think he or writers similar to him are in the same vein as Ligotti or Barker.

And the impact that has had on the world around us","So recently I have been thinking about the influence art, litterature and music has had on the world around us. Especially art; more specifically visual art, sculptures, paintings etc.   
I started thinking about this because of a certain opinion a friend of mine has, one synonymous with the more extreme right wing. The view is that if you study anything that doesn't further our advancement in technology or anything that has a clear visual impact on our lives and world, then you are wasting your time. I found this opinion to be quite contradicting to mine, and probably the majority of people's opinion on art, litterature or music. Which doesn't have that clear of a visual impact as maybe technology or science has. I was getting a bit frustrated because I didn't agree with the view. But I still couldn't formulate a proper informed answer as to why art and the like is just as important. 

Eventually I started to search for some books or articles that could teach me about influence. I want to know how art, litterature, music, folk stories, religion etc. has influenced our world.

I've loved the Song of Ice and Fire series so far, and liked most of the Night Angel Trilogy (some parts I had issues with, like the second book which felt like drabble, the lack of chemistry between the main character and his love interest, the way that women can't do the same kind of magic as men just because they're women??? and the ending). I got halfway through A Darker Shade of Magic and then lost the book, but I enjoyed what I'd read! I also **loved** Mistborn for its really solid feeling magic system. 

I'm sorry if I'm sounding really picky, but I wouldn't be asking if I could think of or find anything on my own! I really appreciate any and all suggestions!",12,9819o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/9819o2/can_anyone_suggest_me_a_book_about_mermaidsmermen/

A ""cozy"" mystery usually takes place in a small, gossipy town, where one detective (amateur or professional) does a lot of mind work to find out whodunnit. It doesn't involve a lot of forensics or violence. It's a source of amusement, not nightmares. It can be brilliantly written (like Rendell's work) or not so much, as long as the story moves quickly and the characters are entertaining.

1947,"People who’ve started reading after years of not, how’d you get back into the habit?","As I laid not sleeping last night I had somewhat of an epiphany, I need to read a damn book. I waste so much time on this god damn site, reading things I will not remember the next day. I used to blow through harry potters, eragons, the whole game of thrones series (except the one from side characters perspectives, shamelessly skipped it). But it’s been about 5 years since I’ve recreationally read, what stopped it was when I began college and did not have time for recreational reading, absolutely despised every single textbook I was forced to read except the one for psych 101 which both interested me in other people’s problems and let me self diagnose my own. I basically dropped out because I couldn’t stand the incredibly awful reading which left a bad taste in my mouth. That’s not the point though. 


So, this weekend I’m going to read the book my father, bought for me more than a year ago, “The Gifts of Imperfection” by Brene Brown, only 30 pages in and I’ve shed a couple tears at how damn relatable this woman is to me. I completely forgot how effective books were at evoking emotions and the beautiful process of words to imagery. Never read a self help book before, but I think I can read more. 


I have ordered Witcher: The last wish, Kings of the Wyld, and The Name of the Wind since they seem popular here to try to ease myself in with some “junk food” reading. I also looked for a book from an English class that I never finished but really liked, all I remember is it was a man living in old California and he sat by his windowsill rolling cigarettes and eating oranges at night, as kinda vague as that is I think you guys will know. 


I’m also looking for a book with a depressed/mentally ill protagonist where you get to read their inner monologues, there’s an episode of Bojack Horseman with this that I loved and found interesting, “Stupid piece of shit”.

1986,5 Science Fiction Books About Human Cloning," 

The announcement of the birth of Dolly – the first cloned mammal – in 1997 gave rise to extensive bio-ethical debate. At the same time, it stimulated longstanding cultural and mythological preoccupations with regard to the potential for human cloning.

The concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured in so many [**science fictions**](https://www.bookishelf.com/category/science-fiction-novels/). Bokanovsky’s Process which featured in Aldous Huxley’s 1931 dystopian novel Brave New World was an early fictional depiction of cloning. The Process is applied to fertilized human eggs in vitro. It causes them to split in identical genetic copies of the original.

Following the interest in cloning in 1950s, Poul Anderson explored the subject further by describing a technology called ‘exogenesis’ in the story UN-Man in 1953, and Gordon Rattray Taylor’s book The Biological Time Bomb made the term ‘cloning’ popular in 1963.

The representation of the process of cloning is done in different ways in fiction. Many fictional works illustrated the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample. The replication may be immediate, or take place through slow growth of human fetus in artificial wombs.

## Here are 5 science fiction books about human cloning which bring up riveting issues of identity and nature versus nurture: whether environment or genetics play larger roles in people’s lives. They also raise questions about technological arrogance and conceits and how far is too far in terms of progress. “What makes us human” is often a fundamental question in sci-fi about human cloning.

#### NEVER LET ME GO BY KAZUO ISHIGURO

The author Kazuo Ishiguro has prioritized the characters’ relationships and reactions over suspense in this novel. The students at Hailsham, a boarding school in the countryside, grow up isolated. Story takes turns when they realise their true purpose later in life.  This novel raises questions about utilitarianism, class and ethics and remind us to cherish time with loved ones.

#### BRAVE NEW WORLD BY ALDOUS HUXLEY

It’s dystopian satire about a place where sexual reproduction is a taboo. Here people are created through cloning and sorted into genetically predetermined social classes. The lower classes are created by Bokanovsky’s Process. The novel is among the first to innovate the idea of cloning; it was first published in 1932, more than 60 years before human cloned first mammal. This work of Huxley was way ahead of its time in terms of scientific progress.

#### THE SECRET BY EVA HOFFMAN

The protagonist Iris Surrey lives in isolation with her wealthy mother in a near future where human cloning is legal. Iris has an identity crisis like many teenagers and she seek to differentiate herself from her parent. The fact that she is her mother’s clone intensifies her quest to find herself. The author also imagined the cult-like groups that might arise when people believe clones to be superior or inferior to other people.

#### THE HOUSE OF THE SCORPION BY NANCY FARMER

This young adult science fiction novel was first published in the year 2002. The protagonist, Matt Alacran, is a clone of the 140 years old drug lord with the same name. This book is equally suspenseful and disturbing, which deals with everything from ableism toward cognitively disabled people, genetic engineering and immigration between the U.S. and Aztlan (formerly Mexico).

#### THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL BY IRA LEVIN

Ira Levin, the author of Rosemary’s Baby, wrote this compelling thriller about cloning of Hitler. The Nazis create 94 clones of Hitler. They try to replicate his life by killing each boy’s father when the son is fourteen years old. By engineering the death of each boy’s father, they want to recreate the social conditions of post-WWI Germany, but they couldn’t.

2016,"Really haven't read many books before, but have always wanted to, suggestions?","Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

As the title suggests, I haven't really read that many books, but I've always liked the idea of it, just kind of never got around to it, I think the only actual books I've read from start to finish have been a couple of Michael Lewis' books, which I really enjoyed, and Kevin Mitnick's(famous hacker back in the day) book which I loved, but nothing fiction in these areas. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now as far as what I like, I would say my three main areas of interest are: 

1. True stories/non-fiction(based on the following topics/genres)
2. Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi/hacker type stuff
3. Adventure/wildlife/survival(lost and had to survive, or stuff with encounters with big cats/large predators, I guess most of these would be true stories too, not sure there would be many fiction/series based around this stuff?)

Some of my favourite T.V Shows/Movies

1. Mr. Robot
2. Altered Carbon(have heard mixed reports on whether the book is better/worse than the show)
3. Black Mirror
4. Homeland
5. Obviously any survival/wild/adventure documentaries as well
6. The Matrix
7. The Bourne Series
8. Ex-Machina
9. Bladerunner: 2049
10. The Edge(Bear survival movie)
11. Ghost and the Darkness(Lion survival movie)
12. Jurassic Park

So any books/series of books along any of these kinds of topics would be awesome! I know some of these are books already but I want to try and avoid reading those as I think it might ruin/influence my love for the show/movie.

2035,Books that a 22 year old female can relate to or learn something relevant to current life,"Hi all!

I've always been an avid reader, reading a wide range of types of books. This year I've read or reread House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski, The Stranger by Camus, The Disaster Artists by Greg Sestero, A Simple Favor by Darcey Bell, etc. My tastes are kind of all over the place. However, whenever I wanted something to relate to or that was relevant to my current life, I've kind of stuck to YA. Now I'm finding that I don't like reading YA that much any more, maybe because I am getting too old or because I'm having older life experiences.

I got divorced last year, was majorly depressed until maybe like January of this year, and I've been working through it everyday (medication did not work for me and my doctor wasn't really working with me). I want a book that I can relate to  that isn't about teens or college aged kids coming of age (YA), but also isn't about 30- or 40- something year olds losing their job/getting a divorce/having some sort of midlife crisis in order to learn how to enjoy their lives.

I want a book that I can relate to, but that doesn't mean that the narrator/protagonist of the book has to be a 22 year old female graduating college soon and getting a divorce lol. I guess themes of overcoming depression would be a plus, but not necessary.

2059,Good book for the Halloween season?,Decided to start a tradition last year where in October I will read a horror book. Last year I read *IT* and it was very enjoyable albeit a tome. The plan is to start to book October 1st and have it finished by October 31st. With that in mind I'm thinking I want to keep it 300 pages or less that way the most I'd have to read if I read every day would be 10 pages. I'm open to either a full length book or an anthology of stories. I really liked Shirley Jackson's *The Lottery and Other Stories* and H.P. Lovecraft's *The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories*. I guess the only subject that I would want to avoid is end-of-the-world type stuff because I usually don't really find that fun and definitely not Halloweeny. Something more modern would be a nice change of pace but older stuff is fine with me too. Also interested to hear about less well known stuff but if it's a classic or well known I'm not opposed.

2064,"[META] About the ""Haven't read in x years/Not an avid reader, suggest me a book"" posts","Disclaimer: I'm not being negative here. These posts are a good way to find out and read good books. But since I see a lot of them, I wanted to make a different kind of suggestion that you can apply together with the other.

Go to a library or a bookstore(any book-getting place), pick a random book, whether you like the name, cover, or backcover description, or maybe you heard about the author before... And just surprise yourselves! It works better if you've never heard about it and can't really tell what genre it is. Worst case scenario you'd say ""meh"" but more often you'll be glad you picked that book.

I occasionally go to a supermarket-type store, where they have variety of underrated books for 3-4$, or to bookfairs and pick up books I'd never heard anything about or about their authors. And many of these turn out really good. I mean, I generally pick things in my genre liking, but they always come out surprising. I think this is a very good way to discover new books, authors and genres. I've even bought other books of some authors I discovered like this.

I really like reading books, especially Sci-Fi-s. I'm currently waiting on the next episode of The Expanse (Tiamat's Wrath), and I need something to read.  
My favorite Sci-Fi writer is without a doubt Isaac Asimov. I read literally all of his books more than once, not just The Foundation trilogy. I really like his writing style, he is the reason I started reading Sci-Fi at the first place. From old-school, Other Sci-Fi-s I read and like:

* Most of  Stanisław Lem
* 2001 Space Odyssey by Arthur Clark
* Downbelow Station by C.J. Cherryh
* The Martian; Artemis by Andy Weir (I adore this two)
* The Three body problem by  Liu Cixin (Basicly changed my view)
* Ender's game by Orson Scott (I liked it very much. I read the rest of the series but that wasn't that good)
* All 6 books of Old Man's War; The Collapsing Empire by John Sclazi (These are awesome as well)
* The Moon and the Other by  John Kessel  (Didn't like it)

I read many fantasy books as well (e.g. I read all of The Witcher books) so I'm ok if a book is not hardcore physics Sci-Fi, although that's what I really liked in The Expanse and Andy Weir books.

2138,Urban fantasy like the Kate Daniels series?,"I really like urban fantasy but I'm sort of stuck in a rut, reading-wise. Ilona Andrews is my favorite writer (with the now-over Kate Daniels series being my favorite of hers). I've also really enjoyed the October Daye series by Seanan McGuire, Cast series by Michelle Sagara (though it's spinning its wheels atm, imo), Faith Hunter books, Walker Papers by CE Murphy and even Patricia Briggs' Mercy series (though a friend and I differ on our enjoyment; I think it's gone a bit downhill).

Overall, I really, really prefer UF with a lot of world building and myth. I don't require romance, though I don't dislike it so long as it's very much background rather than focus of the series (the KD and OD series have a romance that takes a number of books to develop, which is about the speed I prefer). I can enjoy third-person POV, but seem to prefer first-person more. I also like a bit of humor, but a fair bit of darkness is preferred (perhaps not as dark as Anne Bishop's original trilogies, but nothing so silly as MaryJanice Davidson - I have to be in the mood for both). Sex is irrelevant to my interest/disinterest, so long as it isn't a major focus of the book (like Laurell K Hamilton's books).

There's a couple common suggestions like Kim Harrison, Jim Butcher... they're writers I struggle with. I kind of like them but have issues focusing on their books for whatever reason. I'm also not a fan of YA.

2170,Light but engrossing reads post-surgery,"I'll be having surgery soon, and was hoping to get some recommendations of books to read while in hospital and while I recover at home afterwards. I'd prefer something that's easy to concentrate on, while still being engrossing and/or providing a distraction.

I'm generally a fan of fantasy (I'm starting to gravitate towards low fantasy though), mystery elements, historical fiction and science fiction (although to a lesser extent for the latter two), but I am open to other genres.

Some of books/series that I've really enjoyed include (my top 3 are bolded):

* *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr
* *Fish in a Tree* by  Lynda Mullaly Hunt
* *I Capture the Castle* by Dodie Smith
* *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson (especially the second era)
* *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline
* ***Realm of the Elderlings*** **by Robin Hobb**
* Red Rising by Pierce Brown
* ***The Lies of Locke Lamora*** **by Scott Lynch**
* *The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society* by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows
* ***The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet*** **by Becky Chambers**
* *Throne of Glass* by Sarah J Maas (not a fan of her other works though)

I read it when I was about 11 years old, I believe and it was NOT for children. But that didn’t stop me from being super intrigued.

It was about a rat that meets a fairy. The fairy then magically transforms him into a human for one night and he attends some sort of formal dance. I think he meets a woman but then gets transformed back into a rat and comes home, just to find that he can’t understand his rat family and they not him. So he looks for the fairy, finds her and she transforms him back into a human, permanently. 

Inbetween there’s a lot of intrigue going on, tons of people dying and in the end he dies from the Black Plague. 

That’s all I can remember. It’s been at least 7 years now and the book is on my mind for at least once a week.

2249,Trouble reading classics?,"Hi everyone!

Okay so - when I was in elementary and middle school, I read nonstop. I would get yelled at for reading in class. I got yelled at for reading at recess. I would go home from school and read instead of doing my homework. You know, the usual ""voracious reader"" behavior. The books that really got me into reading were Captain Underpants, Goosebumps, Warrior Cats, Dear Dumb Diary, and Sweet Valley Twins. I've probably read every book in each series, some multiple times.

In high school, I continued to read for fun, but not as much as before, because I went to a college prep school and suddenly had to actually try. I'm now in college, and I'm still a big reader, and have been rediscovering my love for it. I read a lot of young adult literature, you know, stuff that's easy to get into and digest. My favorite book of all time is Flowers for Algernon, and others include the Harry Potter series, An Ember in the Ashes, The Book Thief, Gone Girl, The Hunger Games, and Divergent.

Now that you know that about me, here's my problem: I suck at reading classics. I don't know why. But they don't make any sense to me. It's like the words turn into a different language. I suddenly have no idea what's going on or what I'm reading about. This summer I tried to read both Fahrenheit 451 and To Kill a Mockingbird. I didn't finish either. With Fahrenheit, I was just so, so confused. With To Kill a Mockingbird, I got to page 100 and I still didn't even know what the plot was supposed to be.

Am I stupid? Do I just have reading comprehension issues? Do I need to take time out of my life to stop after every page and make a summary of what I just read? That doesn't sound very fun to me. I want to be able to read and enjoy and appreciate the classics. I want to be ""well-read.""

The setting is amazing. I love how it isn't nitty gritty realistic looking stuff, instead its colorful and fantasy like and interesting. I know this sort of thing is hard to convey in Sci-fi, but an interesting setting is big.

[The Order of Odd Fish - James Kennedy.](https://www.amazon.com/Order-Odd-Fish-Author-Kennedy-Mar-2010/dp/B010BFYDNI/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1538005610&amp;sr=1-1)

Top 5 in my personal favorite books of all time. A very whimsical, fantastical, wholesome, imaginative, and comedic book with a sprinkle of epicness. It's about a group of knights who are trying to make an encyclopedia of all the useless *wrong* facts to have ever existed. If you love Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, the Harry Potter series, Good Omens, and the Phantom Tollbooth, think of this book as a weird combination of the four?

[White Horse - Alex Adams](https://www.amazon.com/White-Horse-Novel-Alex-Adams/dp/1451642997/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538005560&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=white+horse+book)

An engrossing post-apocalyptic book about the ""White Horse"" plague that wipes out humanity, as well as WW3 for control over the weather. Told in alternating chapters of Before and After. **Warning** This is a very adult novel with some severe content, even in the first chapter.

[Singularity - Zack Hubert](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0998565806/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Good intelligent sci-fi novel. Doesn't assume you're dumb. If you liked the movies Arrival, The Martian, Interstellar or Inception, you'll like this book a lot.

[The Prince of Milk](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1983699748/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

A gloriously existential and comedic novel that put the entire universe (and my life along with it) in perspective.

I'm sharing these books for many reasons. The first is because there's no lonelier feeling than loving a book no one, not even fellow book lovers, have heard of before. Two, is that I think these authors deserve more recognition, and THREE, I feel like these can give a lot of you a fresh read if you're looking for some.",309,9j7vdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/9j7vdn/hidden_gems_id_like_to_share_some_extremely/

2280,Desperately need some of your best suggestions - I got 9 days...,"My 14 year old son - my smart, beautiful, funny, friendly, decent son was caught shoplifting yesterday. He stole vodka for OTHER people - who never paid him for it - because he was so desperate for friends and ...for money so he could build a car... we have bought him things and he didn't want to ask us for anything more as he knew we have done a lot for him.  Also, greed - wanting it all, now. As he's 14 he's been told how very hard it is to get a job and earn any decent money. His pocket money of 50 quid a month gets blown on energy drinks and data. We have recently moved to the UK from overseas - his dad is still working away - and we moved back so he could have opportunities and a school.  Yeah... That's not really gone to plan.  In his defense - he has worked incredibly hard at trying to make friends and join clubs and go to classes outside school but he's either been placed with 7 year old beginners or adults (because he's so mature)  - he is unusually and massively struggling to connect with any decent kids his own age. He is very, very sad, and beyond remorseful and it's devastating to be honest. 

The upshot is, I have taken his phone and computer off him for 10 days and grounded him. Partly for punishment and partly because 'social media' / so called 'friends' are so fucking garbage and...because his school has suggested this measure for his safety - he's been/being threatened by some of the people 'involved.' I'm half-sure it's smack talk but... So, he is off school for a week's half term. This is a week to read books (or watch movies) and I get to choose them - he's got nothing else to do.  Please give me your best advice and best suggestions - I'm ready to amazon prime 3 (ish) books which he will read. He can 'read' but he's never loved it. I've made him read quite a few half decent books but he needs something special. He needs ...hope? Something about digging in when shit gets bad and finding your way out of it. A slap?  I don't know guys. I'm desperate. I want this week to 'fix' him... Help him find his backbone again, his passion, his dignity, a path and a way forwards. I just see teenagers so fucking hopeless which such low aspirations and so much anxiety and it's breaking my heart.

List of things I can think of that might steer suggestions included","I put together this list of things and then tried to come up with a description of what I like once I'd narrowed down some thoughts...

I guess my search is for something strongly narrative driven, often quirky, maybe through the eyes of an insane/drunk/or high character who has a very cynical outlook on life. Darkly funny, either satirical or a little sci-fi I guess. I'm kind of after something a little less well known, that maybe even falls into the ""cult"" status of novels. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Currently reading:** 

The Wasp Factory by Ian Banks; only a short way through, loving the dark twisted nature of it and very vividly written style.

**Just finished:** 

Catch-22 by Joseph Heller ; loved the satire and the very dry quirky humour.

**Other books that I love:**

The Rum Diary &amp; Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas both by Hunter S. Thomspon's style is fantastic, would love to be recommended a direction to take with his writing. 

A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess; dark and funny, an awkward read to begin with but you fall into the language.

Hangover Square by Patrick Hamilton; one of my all time favourite books a great read.

**TV shows/Movies that may indicate other things I like (shamefully more a watcher than a reader):**

Russian Doll; Netflix Original, has a quirky, almost sci-fi feel to it, follows a couple troubled individuals.

The End of the Fucking World; based off a graphic novel, a sort of young Bonny &amp; Clyde.

\^ the ""feel"" of these two shows is something I love so if that translates into any books you know even better!

True Romance: A cult classic and an all time favourite, a Tarantino screenplay.

Donnie Darko

Bojack Horseman; falls heavily into the quirky, darkly funny, follows a spiralling substance abuser throughout.

Breaking Bad &amp; The Sopranos.

2341,Just finished Red Rising by Pierce Brown and it blew me away. It reignited my love for reading fiction that had been dwindling. Any recommendations similar to this series?,"Man, this book. I know I'm a few years late to the party but...I'm sad it's over. 

I can't remember the last time I was this emotionally invested in a story. Reading this book made me not want to do anything else! I wish I had been able to read it faster, but life gets in the way. Still, in between responsibilities and during class and work, I was thinking about it. 

I had emotional responses to so much of this story. I felt genuine sadness, joy, anxiety. The character's fears became my own. The protagonist's rage boiled within me. When acts of betrayal or bouts of romance occurred, I really felt it in my heart. 

There was one chapter, about 280 pages in, that was literally gut wrenching. I ate it up, but I actually had to put the book down to let what just happened sink in. I felt the same anguish that the main character felt. 

I don't remember the last time a book has done this to me, but I absolutely loved it. The action is tight and focused, the twists are shocking and heartbreaking. The descriptions are incredibly vivid and the world built here is so lively and entrancing. 

Friendships break, lives are lost, love is created and broken and strengthened. Rage Burns on. Hope never waivers. This is the kind of book I have dreamed of writing myself, and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to read it. I would love to meet Pierce Brown, just so I could shake his hand and thank him so much for it. 

Check this book out, if you haven't already. It's not perfect, few books are, but it is definitely worth it. Meanwhile, I'm going to go start the next one!

As the title suggests I’m a big lover of fantasy books and have been reading the genre since I was a child. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with this I feel like I’m missing out on a world of good books. Since I had absolutely no idea what to search for my google results have all been in vain to try and find something that will help bridge the gap. So I’m asking you guys to try please help me find something from another genre that I might enjoy. I’ll give a few examples of fantasy series that stood out to me that might help:

Malazan,
A song of ice and fire,
Harry Potter,
Discworld and 
The dark tower series

As you can see I tend to enjoy some of the more gritty dark fantasy but I do also sometimes enjoy lots of typical fantasy such as the classics like LOTR and wheel of time etc.. but I’ve digested more light hearted things like Disc world and Harry potter that have stood out.

Id argue that I don't have much passion for it at the moment but I don't want to give up reading all together otherwise thatd be it. I really like horror books, so things about werewolves and other supernatural entities are things I enjoy, kinda vague I know. Ideally something easy to read and please nothing with suicide or things of that nature please

Couple of books I read recently was one called The Son Of The Werewolf by Guy N. Smith. It wasn't amazing but I was good because 1 it was horror and 2 it was only 123 pages long so I got through it without tossing it aside feeling fatigued and bored. The other example is a book called The Vampire, by Roger Vadim. It's a collection of excerpts and short stories taken from famous vampire stories and legends, which is good because I can read the short stories and 'complete' them if you like and it gives me a little motivation to keep going. 

I do like reading, I don't want it to come across like I don't because that is not the case at all, I hope all this makes sense

2398,Dystopia/Post-Apocalyptic,"Hey all, I'm looking for a good dystopian and/or post-apocalpytic book. I just tried to read Red Rising and I greatly dislike the writing style, and that's an important element to me. I can't really pinpoint it, but if I had to take a stab, it seems constantly fast-paced, even in parts when the pace seems like it should be moderated. Even as YA, which it is not, but is often confused as such, it doesn't seem well-written. I think I'm in the minority on that opinion, though.   
ANYWAY - I want to read a good one! Books I've read that touch on dystopian/post-apocalpse:

1984  
Animal Farm  
Brave New World  
Handmaid's Tale  
Oryx and Crake (in the middle of the Year of the Flood, but it is running the opposite of Red Rising, it is so slow)  
The Wool Series  
The Passage Series  
Farenheit 451  
World War Z  
The Road  
Station Eleven  
The Giver  
Canticle for Liebowitz (I know this is a classic, but man did I have trouble slogging through it)  
The Dark Tower series  


I'm sure there are a few more that I'm not recalling. I'm not a huge fan of any of the YA's, not that it doesn't have value, it's just not my cup of tea.

Favorites from over the years:

Jim Butcher's Dresden Files (unfortunately, not his other main series) 

Eddings' Belgariad/Malloreon 

Zelazny's Amber series

Roberson's Cheysuli and Sword Dancer series

Simon R Green's Nightside 

I've been drifting away from hard fantasy, but I *love* supernatural fantasy. I don't prefer anything graphically sexual or romance based (since they can be common themes in the genre), though I love The Sonja Blue trilogy and Rice's Vampire Chronicles - it's not a deal breaker. Detective style presentation is a huge plus.

2457,Looking for a book with story similar to the game Horizon Zero Dawn,"I played this game two years ago, and it has captivated me to this date. To briefly summarize for those not familiar with it, the story is set in a post-apocalyptic future Earth (circa 3000 AD), inhabited by tribal human societies, who are primitive but still have access to remnant advanced technology, co-existing (more or less) with AI-regulated, specialized, animal-like robots responsible for terraforming the previously and temporarily lifeless planet. All life had been extinguished after the aforementioned apocalyptic event due to AI mismanagement by past humans, so the ancestors of these modern tribal humans were all ""factory""-born and raised by AI until they were left to fend off for themselves. Most of this is lost knowledge to the these modern humans, and it's only revealed during the protagonist's quest throughout the game.

Obviously, there won't be a very close match, but I'll take anything similar because I am very fascinated by this story, especially the terraformation AI elements.

The problem is, in many of the books I’ve seen with stepparents, the stepparents aren’t treated like simply another member of the child’s family like an aunt with a prominent spot in a storyline would be treated. Damn you Disney for setting up the evil stepmother trope!

She loves the picture books I bought her about different types of families and having two houses. It sparks deep conversations about what family means and living across two houses. 

I think it would blow her mind if she read a book with an actual plot (ideally a plot outside of just stepfamily dynamics) where a child went between two houses.

She loves the Magic Treehouse series and the Clarence Bean books. She is naturally drawn to books where the words are “fun” (whether that mean differing fonts or the way the words are placed on a page) and where there are pictures every so often, but what keeps her reading is humor/sarcasm and adventure.

14 by Peter Clines (although it sure uses many stereotypes and got a bit silly in the last 1/3. I still loved the exploration aspect)

Short stories/creepy pasta like that one about Ted the Caver (hosted on angelfire, no less lol) and of course the SCP Stories, my favourite one being the one about the staircase.

Various stories by HP Lovecraft and I'm working my way through those.

2553,I want to read a book that genuinely feels like a Boris Vallejo painting.,"I want to read a fantasy book that really is set in another place, and another time entirely. I don't just want ""medieval Europe with wizards,"" I want a genuinely fantastical setting, with magical weapons, mysterious ruins, weird creatures, human hybrids, and awesome vistas. I want the whole book to feel like a Vallejo painting, not just have one on the cover. Romance, sex, politics and war are okay, but thrilling adventure and the fantastical elements should be first and foremost. The movies closest to what I'm looking for are ""Fire and Ice"" (1983) and ""Taarna"" from ""Heavy Metal"" (1981).",12,b2373x,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/b2373x/i_want_to_read_a_book_that_genuinely_feels_like_a/

The optimist doesn't have to save the world or anything, they can do something as simple as convincing another person that it's not foolish to hope when it seems like there's none left, but I just want to read a book where the main message is essentially the opposite of ""the world you live in is awful, and you're an idiot for having hope/being a decent human being in such an awful place.""

2573,Very specific craving for post-apocalyptic feminist survival books,"I can't get enough of it, but I have very specific desires for the books I'd like to read and it's difficult to find. I really prefer female authors and protagonists, in the time following retreading old traumas through #metoo stories, I have struggled to read novels by men. I also love science fiction and am craving these end of civilization stories, but so many centered on women have a lot of rape or center their stories on forced birth or fertility stories a la Children of Men /Handmaid's Tale. It seems impossible to avoid mentions of rape in these stories, but at the very least I'd like to avoid graphic descriptions or character/plot development dependent on rape. 

I have read and loved Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel and Parable of the Sower/Talents by Octavia Butler. I also liked the first book in the YA series Life as We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer. 

I am obsessed with these survival books and I guess the descriptions of prepping -- filling up shopping carts with supplies, taking inventory, describing the food they cook, and the items they hoard. Maybe it's because I was so obsessed with My Side of the Mountain when I was a kid.

2577,Reading Every Great Book in History in 10 Years,"I've grown up reading and loving books. I pursued the humanities at college and became a high school humanities teacher who taught history and lit.

But several years ago, I started to feel overwhelmed. Every time I went to a bookstore or library, I found stacks of great books that I've never read--whether it be from Ancient history like, *The Gallic Wars* by Caesar, or the 19th century age of Realism, like, *Tess of the D'Urbervilles*.

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I tried to tackle these great books, I often felt like I was taking stabs in the dark. There was no sense of continuity. Often I needed to research earlier works to understand the references in the book I was reading (I'm looking at you, *Ulysses).*

&amp;#x200B;

It all lead me to pick up a book by scholar Mortimer J. Adler called *How to Read A Book.* In it, Adler made a point I still think about today. He said *the best way to read a book was by reading good ones.* In the back, he included a list of what he called the ""Great Conversation"", or, ""The Great Books List."" He would later publish the list in an infamous [multi-volume series.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World)

&amp;#x200B;

So two years ago I set a New Year's Resolution to read through the entire list within ten years. By the time I'm 33, I hope to have read in sequence every great work in Western history, and allow work to build upon the last.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever tried this before? Any tips? What were your reactions? Has anyone actually ever finished the list? I've been blogging my journey through the list [here](https://www.greatbookschallenge.org/). I've looked all over online for some kind of community, but never found one.

I like action/adventure - but, not when it's only that. 
The trouble is; I'm very sensitive to violence and so there's a lot of books with too much of it (I can handle a little!) Also, I don't like it when the books are predictable(typically romance) and I detest crime. 

I've recently read all the books by Michael J Sullivan and loved them. Other books I really liked are Lord of the Rings, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Stormlight Archives, Jane Eyre, Jane Austen's books and of course more, but I can't come up with them right now.

It's a national 10 day event celebrating Dutch literature books. As part of Book Week a Dutch or Flemish author is invited to write (what usually turns out to be) a novella dealing with that year's theme, called the Boekenweekgeschenk, or Book Week Gift. Anyone who buys one or more books in a bookstore during this week for a total price of €12,50 or more gets this special book for free. This year the theme is 'de moeder de vrouw', which can be (very) loosely translated into matriarch, or the overly motherly woman in a family. 

As a Dutchie myself I thought it would be nice to have a whole week of suggestions for anything relating to Dutch literature, either in Dutch or translated, or books about the Dutch. Books that deal with both this year's theme AND in Dutch will score bonus points.       
I hope this will be fun for us Dutchies, and fun / interesting perhaps for those not from The Netherlands and wanting to learn more about us.

To kick things off....

*The Discovery of Heaven* by Harry Mulisch (turned into a movie starring Stephen Fry amongst others)

2667,books with an eerie sense of mystery/exploration. Books where something is not quite right.,"Hi!

I'm looking for a book that is a bit mysterious/eerie, has a sense of discovery, perhaps takes place in a strange world (or a world that seems like ours but something is off). 

Some books that I've loved that fits this description:

1. Wayward Pines: man wakes up in a hospital and has no idea how he got there. When he escapes (bc they wouldn't let him leave) he enters a town he's never been to but something is weird and the ""perfect town"" is hiding something

2. Annihilation (southern reach): team of scientists go on an expedition to an area of wilderness called area X. Strange things happen, and there's this sense of discovery and exploration in the book. 

3. Dark Matter: I don't want to spoil it because it's the BEST BOOK EVER but basically a man wakes up in a world that's not his own. His wife isn't his wife, etc. He has to figure out what happened. 

4. American Elsewhere: a woman drives to a ""perfect"" small town where something is off about the residents. 

5. Invasion of the body snatchers: this is a fun 50's scifi book and basically the town little by little is taken over by aliens pretending to be the residents. I like the sense of mystery and not knowing who is an alien. 

6. To Kill a Kingdom: this book was not great. It was kind of a guilty pleasure. But it took place in a sort of fantasy world where there were mermaids in the ocean and different kingdoms with a vibe of mystery and exploration. 

7. The Girl Before: this is a psychological thriller. A girl moves into a new apartment but realizes the girl who lived there before was murdered and suspects it was the real estate agent (or something like that, it's been a while since i read it)

8. Before I go to sleep: a woman has amnesia and can only hold memories for 1 day. She begins to suspect that her husband is up to something so she leaves herself notes from yesterday in a diary. 



What I DON'T want in a book is high fantasy. I hate books that are way too serious or  have complex political structures. Books that start out like ""Qavanth, leader of the 7th Kindom in the territory of Fwlekfjl..."" no thank you.

I just want a book with an eerie vibe that makes me curious to keep reading.

2669,What are your favorite books of 2019 so far?,"So, I write for literary sites and magazines and read a lot. But I find myself in a bubble of the same sort of books (literary fiction, memoirs, essays) and don’t read a lot of genre. Curious what y’all are reading?

Here are 12 I loved. [Photo for the visual inclined.](https://imgur.com/a/SlxPucD)

In no particular order...

**Go Ahead in the Rain:** Part biography, part cultural criticism. Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet-turned-music critic-turned-poet again. His writing swims on the page and if you’re looking how to make your writing better, this book will teach you that. It will also teach you about A Tribe Called Quest, rap and culture in the 1990s, and what it means to grow up.

**The Good Immigrant:** A Collection of essays about immigration, race, ethnicity, and America. The writers they got for this is a who’s who of today’s more important and up-and-coming writers. My favorite essay – which is biased because it’s from one of my top five living writers – is Alexander Chee’s “Your Father’s Country.”

**Magical Negro:** Confession: I don’t read a lot of poetry. I am trying to read four collections this year. Morgan Parker’s was the one I picked to start the year off. I’m no eloquent enough to explain why it’s so good. Which I guess sounds like poetry requires some sort of hoity toity education. It doesn’t. My relationship with Magical Negro was one that made me think and feel. I’m still thinking about it weeks later.

**An Orchestra of Minorities:** This is the type of novel that seems ordinary, but then by page 50 you realize it’s extraordinary and unlike anything you’ve ever read. It seems like a straight forward immigration and love story. But it dives deep into Igbo folklore and the supernatural. The only thing I can say is expect the unexpected.

**A Woman is No Man:** Rarely do we see such an honest portrayal of Arab-Amerian women in literature. That’s because, according to Etaf Rum, they’re taught to keep their culture’s secrets private. By writing this, the author says her community feels she betrayed them. She wrote about the dark side of marriage and abuse. It’s a haunting story, but an important one to read and spread.

**American Spy:** The short version is that this book is about a black female spy in Africa during the Cold War. The slightly longer version is that it is a meditation on what it means to be a black woman in America. It is a spiritual ancestor to Invisible Man and explores double consciousness. Lauren Wilkinson broke spy tropes, but also added to a very important canon in African-American literature.

**Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls:** A memoir about broken families, alcoholism and addiction, and sexual discovery. T Kira Madden’s essays are breathtaking. She subtly brings the reader in to her world. Not all of us were queer outcasts in a posh private school, but it was so easy to connect with her thoughts and emotions through her approachable writing.

**Lot:** Bryan Washington’s story collection is about race, masculinity, sexuality, and Houston. Each story takes place in a neighborhood in his native city, and Houston becomes its own character throughout the collection. He offers readers an insight into his characters and their world with such ease.  If you’re not a fan of story collections, fret not: he weaves together characters and places throughout the collection to offer a holistic feel to everything.


**Parkland:** Dave Cullen was one of the first journalists on the scene at Columbine in 1999. He wrote the definitive book on the massacre and became the “mass shooting guy” for news stations. Parkland isn’t about the shooting or the shooter. It’s about the response the teens had after and the movement they created. America is broken; this book is a step to healing us.

**Sugar Run:** A slow, sultry noir about a woman getting out of jail after nearly two decades and trying to find her place in the world. My favorite part about this was how Mesha Maren created the atmosphere of Appalachia on the page. The story is enthralling, but her ability to capture place and setting really made this novel stick with me.


**Bangkok Wakes to Rain:** Filled with loosely connected threads, this novel is an ode of Pitchaya Sudbanthad’s hometown. The vignettes and sections that fill this book offer a wide lens to view the city through. From an American doctor a entry ago trying to adjust to the city to local shop owners in present-day, we are offered an inside look into a city that is an enigma to the world, but also itself.


**Survival Math:** Subtitled “Notes on an All-American Family,” Mitchell S. Jackson’s memoir reveals how his life and family were shaped by “gangs and guns, near-death experiences, sex work, the concept of hustle, and the destructive power of addiction.” So often we think the All-American family is that white, nuclear quartet of a dad, mom, daughter, and son. Jackson’s memoir proves America is much more complex than that. If you haven’t realized how diverse our country is yet, then this book is the book you need to read right now.

The doctors have told her if things do not change she could be dead within a year. After getting this news she took a break from our relationship to clear her head (understandable). And has not spoken to me since. Much less even acknowledge my existence. At this point I am not even sure if I will see or speak to her again.

The next day after our decided break. I lost my job. This place was a second home to me. With people I considered family. I am now utterly isolated with very few friends and, family to turn too. 

I have spent my time. Pushing myself out of the typical nihilism and, depression of such random events. Into a better life. I have analyzed my problems of character which led to my job loss. I have tried to come to terms with my relationship problems. I took the asvab and am beginning the next chapter in my life. Joining the navy. 

What I need is books to help me get through this. Books that help you come to terms with life just falling apart on a dime. Helping come to terms with the worst parts of yourself and, pushing through them. Books to help understand the facets of life. Change, impermanence, death, greif, and the nature of reality. Yet also fighting against the cowardice of nihilism. Choosing to embrace life. Anything on emotional maturity, a stoic attitude, a resolve to life. Would be greatly helpful. I just need something to help me mature and, grow. To not let this kill me. To make sense of it all.

So, I’m looking for a book about science with a story-esque narrative. Any discipline, though I am particularly interested in physics, astronomy, botany, environmental/natural history and chemistry. But, like I said, I’m open to others. Also, the book can be technically fiction, but I want the facts to be real. No sci-fi. I want to learn.

2704,I just finished ”Sadie” and wanted to put it out there!,"I liked it a lot! It was a book I chose while on a hunt to find something new to read after Gone Girl.. I think it was from a Buzzfeed list? The POV switches between Sadie (the main character) and a podcast host that is following her story and her clues left behind, all while trying to find her.
 
The description: 

A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A *Serial*―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.

Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.

But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.

2706,What's the most comforting book you can think of?,"Hi everyone. Apologies if this request isn't specific enough but.....my dad has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and it doesn't look like he's got very long left. I'm already in a pretty bad place mentally regardless of that news, and I have a tendency to turn to stupid self-destructive behaviours in difficult times like this. So, rather than allowing myself to do that, I'd like to immerse myself in comforting, soul-soothing books. If anyone has recommendations for fiction or poetry that fit that bill, I'd be really grateful. I'm not generally that into fantasy, but any other genre is great. I especially enjoy short stories (favs include George Saunders, Lorrie Moore, Alice Munro, Carson McCullers, etc) and poets such as Mary Oliver, Helen Dunmore, Emily Dickinson.

I'm having more trouble thinking of science fiction to introduce her to.  Most of what I enjoy has stuff that would be inappropriate for a kid that age or is just too technical and would cause her to lose interest.

I know there's a thousand ""recommend me a good book"" posts and I think I'm violating a rule here, but I'm looking for something a bit more specific.

I am terminally ill and have trouble with my motor skills, and reading is one of the only hobbies I can still enjoy. As time ticks on I find myself caring way less about things (books, movies, conversations, etc) that don't have much depth to them, and preferring things that get my mind working in a more philosophical, imaginative or introspective way.

I generally prefer sci fi (finishing Fall of Hyperion right now), but I'm open to books that make me think, laugh, cry, explore, or debate - both fiction and nonfiction. It doesn't have to be death-related but I don't mind. Spiritual content is fine as long as it doesn't expect the reader to be a believer from page one (I'm not). Well done audiobooks might be preferable to print because I can close my eyes.

Bigfoot/*sea monsters*/lost cities/ancient relics/stuff like that! They don’t even necessarily need to be specifics books, but I’d love to read about these people.

The century isn’t that important to me, but I’m especially fond of the 19th century!

And now that I think about it, the stuff they’re looking for doesn’t need to be that unique as I’m sure that’s a little rarer (as in it can just be explorers discovering new worlds and things), but I’m especially interested in explorers whose writing paints these discoveries or expositions as beautiful and exotic/otherworldly.

If it wasn’t obvious, I was inspired by the newly released *Missing Link*. It reminded me of *The Lost City of Z* and *Indiana Jones*.

I know the request probably sounds broad, so maybe if I list some more specific questions here you guys will have a better idea of what to recommend, so here are some questions, in no particular order:
What are the time-scales involved? Say, how long did it take for like the grizzly bear and polar bear to part from a common ancestor? Are different kinds of bears more like different breeds of dogs (in as they could mate and produce offsprings), or are they more like lions and tigers in that sense? Some species seem so good at one oddly specific thing, how did evolution make that happen? Was one of their ancestor just weirdly obsessed with something and just passed down their secret to their offsprings, so and so on until they evolved super weirdly good at that one thing? How long does it take for species with a common ancestor to ""diverge"" and seem completely unrelated? How did multi-cellular organisms evolve from uni-cellular ones? Do plants and animals have a common ancestor? How long ago was that? Mating rituals... wtf? How do they evolve? Especially with birds, they just seem so weird, why do these weird dances, which to my eyes don't indicate strong genes, make the females want to reproduce? (I guess you could say the same about us though lmao)

I probably have many more, but I guess this gives you an idea of what I am looking for. As for the level of the book, I am a pretty scientifically inclined person (finishing my bachelor's in physics in a couple of weeks), but I don't know squat about biology other than popular science I guess, so I would probably prefer some more ""vulgarized"" books (is vulgarized the right work in English?), but if you have some higher level stuff you think I would like, recommend away!

I finished yesterday which I was impressed with considering I'm a fairly slow reader and I have been pretty busy with classes, and *Dune* was really really dense for me, but still totally readable. The book blew me away. I immediately went and bought all the sequels, but sadly they won't be here until June 4th because they're new printings, so I want some books to read in the interim.

It doesn't necessarily have to be sci-fi, although I do love sci-fi. In terms of other books I've read for pleasure in adulthood, I've read *Ready Player One* which was just okay, *The Martian* which I absolutely adored, and *Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy* which I really enjoyed, and I forgot what it was called but it was a nonfiction book about success and successful people, which I really enjoyed. Those are about it (along with *Dune*)

Hi there!

I'm a pretty big reader, and am therefore constantly looking for new books, but I always seem to be at the end of my rope when it comes to finding quality stuff.

I'm not too picky regarding themes or even quality (as long as it doesn't plain suck), but here's the kick: I'm fed up with medieval-witchy-otherearthly fantasy books, as well as with the spacecrafty-futuristic-dystopian shitshows that are so many sci-fi books.

To be as clear as possible, my go-to books are those set up within our world where characters earn powers, travel through time/dimensions, meet godly creatures, or, quite the opposite, when characters that come from other times/dimensions have to navigate our world. Not that common, I know. 

If that helps, here are a few books that I really enjoyed over the past few years : Dark Matter, All our wrong todays, The invisible library, The Rook, and so on.

Do you guys share some of my interests? Can anyone help me find a new book to munch on? Thanks a lot in advance! :)",11,bemgoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/bemgoq/looking_for_nonspace_nonmedieval_scififantasy/
2805,"I'm looking for horror, sci fi and fantasy books","I prefer series but i'm ok with standalone novels too.

I really like the vorkosigan series but would prefer a series with a strong female protagonist. I don't really like romance so if theres none of that I would prefer that. I also really loved Hyperion by Dan Simmons if that helps.

I want a fantasy series with a ""hero"" who isn't all goody two shoes or ""the power of friendship can conquer anything"". I would love a series like a song of ice and fire(?) where people can die and bad things happen to the good guys. Or a series with the protagonist being a bad person or willing to do bad things for the greater good.

And i haven't really read anything horror themed since goosebumps as a child and short stories by hp lovecraft as a teen. I would love something that scares the hell out of me. I love monsters and bodyhorror but don't mind a person being the monster too.

I loved the author’s voice and art style, I found myself howling with laughter at the mishaps and misadventures and feeling her pain during her life’s trials, it was a work that really moved me when I first read it and the many times I’ve reread it over the years.

It doesn’t have to be a biographical and historical work like hers, but in terms of themes like slice of life, humour, romance, coming of age and drama. Stories about people living their lives, coming to terms with life and loss, but in a graphic novel.

Amy on the Cool Girl:

&gt;“Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl. Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain.”

Nick on whether we are actually human anymore:

&gt;“The secondhand experience is always better. The image is crisper, the view is keener, the camera angle and the soundtrack manipulate my emotions in a way reality can’t anymore. I don’t know that we are actually human at this point, those of us who are like most of us, who grew up with TV and movies and now the Internet. If we are betrayed, we know the words to say; when a loved one dies, we know the words to say. If we want to play the stud or the smart-ass or the fool, we know the words to say.

I read The Road by Cormac McCarthy as well as Suttree, but they just don't have that truly *epic*, and *soaring* sensation to them that BM has. Upon finishing BM, I felt that feeling I always get after laying to rest an ancient or medieval epic.

2) The biblical style he deploys in the narration,

3) The abominable and unforgettable character the Judge,

4) The heroic narrative,

5) The symbolism,

6) The marauding journey the Glanton Gang takes across the desert,

7) And finally the dispassionate narrative McCarthy melds into violent scenes (quite like Homer in the Iliad or the Odyssey).

I need a book to help me understand that that can be normal, and one of the many phases we go through in life.","I normally enjoy the process of discovering the book I need/want to read, by going through lists and subreddits and then deep-diving into a few candidates. This time, however, I felt like throwing my question at the world would be the best way of getting answers, because of the oddity of how I feel: I'm only quasi-interested in the men in my life who are available and seem to like me, but I don't think I like them genuinely enough to want it to go anywhere. At the same time, I keep thinking about my relationship with a previous boyfriend and how perfect it was (until it wasn't, and now I'm not sure how I'd feel if I met him again, given my current mood). It could be that I just don't want to date for a while, but that doesn't explain why I still think so much about how great a great relationship would be.

A few fiction books have inadvertently helped me reconcile with a lot of discomfiting truths, about myself and how relationships work. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert taught me that it's understandable to feel boredom and contempt towards even the most well-meaning of partners. It also taught me that although seeking excitement outside might help in the short run, it can also be ruinous when it's with people who aren't of a similar emotional makeup.

Tender is the Night by Fitzgerald was instructive from the perspective of the male protagonist. Dick Diver gradually falls out of love with his wife despite himself, because he is so exhausted of having to constantly take care of her and protect her. It made me realize that it's probably not the best idea to want all of your problems to be solved by the same person.

I'm looking for something in the same vein at the moment, where the characters in the course of their lives go through things that help me rationalize what I'm feeling. I'm open to all suggestions!

2867,"I've really been struggling to find something to read that fits my criteria lately. I know ""fantasy (high or low) romance"" is a pretty common tag, but I'm a bit more particular about what I am looking for, and most recommendation sites keep shoving teen romance novels in my face. Please help.","As a preface, I've been a huge fan of young adult books my entire life, of which my favorite series in that category is Ranger's Apprentice by John Flanagan. My favorite fantasy series (regardless of intended age group) is anything from Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings universe, particularly the first and fourth trilogies focusing on Fitz. The gentleman Bastards series is a close second.

The reason for this is that I have a few specific preferences:

1. I prefer the romance to hold a secondary role to the fantasy tag. I enjoy having romance develop through the book, but it shouldn't constantly be the primary focus or the reason for the story's existence.

2. I would vastly prefer a male protagonist, in part due to how these stories usually play out. I've found that 90%+ of stories with the tags I search for that also have female protagonists have way too many romance tropes, little to no meaningful character development for her, and the fantasy tag almost always takes a backseat to crappy romance writing.




3. I enjoy when characters have significant development, both from a personal and inter-personal perspective. Having the character age throughout the series is a bonus, such as the protagonists from the first two series mentioned above. 

3. I am always open to having mature themes be present, regardless of type. I do prefer them not to be overly-frequent, as they get stale quickly. A good book shouldn't have to rely on that type of content to be good, anyway.

4. I am alright with magic and supernatural-ish themes being present, but I'm also okay with them not being present too. Bonus points for medieval settings.

I think that's most of it. If anyone has any suggestions based on that, I would be happy to give them a shot. I can always give more details if something needs to be clarified, too.",13,bhzd2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/bhzd2f/ive_really_been_struggling_to_find_something_to/

2908,Romance with emphasis on emotion and little to no sex scenes,"I'm looking for a romance that's more emotional than sexual. 

I'm usually drawn to scifi and/or weird fiction, but on occasion I feel like reading a romance. Usually the romance I stumble across has a trope I enjoy, but they're all pretty sex-driven, which isn't exactly what I normally look for. 

I'm not opposed to some sex scenes if they're add-ons rather than the driving force of the story, but would prefer if they'd be of the ""fade to black"" variety. I do enjoy the build up and sexual tension if it's done well, but the main event rarely holds much appeal. Doesn't matter if it's straight, gay, lesbian, bi, asexual - what have you. 

(My aversion to smut stems from no personal interest in sex, rather than prudishness. Reading sex scenes usually interests me on the same level as reading someone's descriptions of their workouts. )

**Looking for**: well-written depictions of emotion. Bonus points for banter and/or the ability to make me cry.

**Not looking for:**  instalove, infidelity/love triangles, more than two participants in general",15,bjtb14,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/bjtb14/romance_with_emphasis_on_emotion_and_little_to_no/
2909,"Looking for fantasy with great characters (love ASOIAF, didn't love Name of The Wind or The Way of Kings)","I know posts looking for the next **ASOIAF** are a dime a dozen, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway.

Being new to the genre, I was blown away by the complicated yet deeply likeable characters in ASOIAF - as well as its incredible world building and unpredictable plotlines. 

I tried to read **The Name of the Wind** but had to give up halfway through as I couldn't connect to the main character at all - even if I thought the world was pretty cool. 

I recently finished **The Way of Kings** and thought it was...okay. But again, the characters were a bit uninteresting to me. Lots of honorable people doing honorable things for honor - and being (mostly) rewarded for it in the end. 

So I guess what I'm looking for is fantasy with strong characters (in particular female, if possible) that avoids/subverts the most common tropes of the genre?",16,bjugqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/bjugqn/looking_for_fantasy_with_great_characters_love/

Goals. 

(1). [parenting / self help?] I’m going to be a new dad and want to be the best father and person in general that I can be.


(2.)  [business] I have an opportunity to work for my family business and possibly move up into a higher management position or higher. I haven’t started yet but if I go back to school idk I could possibly run the place if I put my mind to it? Idk maybe that would be cool. 

3.). [Entertainment]  would also be nice in this new hobby of mine. I mean I dropped read dead 2 for this new hobby.  I enjoy getting lost in the magic in life. I’ve only really felt this feeling with a high dose of shrooms. Well I guess that’s a lie . Now that the fog of addiction is clearing the warm smile of my wife and her laying next to me snoring and the fact we are adulting (jobs,bills, dogs,responsibility’s) is some what pure magic to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Several years ago, I passed a book on to my mom called Rose in a Storm, by Jon Katz. It is  about Rose, a border collie who lives on a farm and has a very close relationship with the farmer. A storm is coming, and they get the farm and all of the animals ready to stay safe. It is simple, but has more depth than you would think from my description. It is told from Rose's POV, which, again, sounds like it could be silly but is not. 

&amp;#x200B;

It turned out to be one of my mom's favorite books ever, and I would like to find something else that is similar. Jon Katz has written other books, but they're all memoirs. There are plenty of novels about animals, and a few that are like 'Rose' in that the animal is the narrator, but nothing that has the right mix of story (calm but a bit suspenseful), realism (as much as possible) in how the animal's thoughts are conveyed, charm, and elegant simplicity. And that realism has to be carried out with no animal deaths -- or at least, no animal deaths that are upsetting. In 'Rose' a donkey dies during the storm, but it is not played up for maximum emotional impact, Marley-and-Me style.

2967,Erotic literature? Perhaps from a male perspective? (NSFW),"This is a little embarrassing... even though you can’t see me. 

Okay, so I’m certainly not interested in anything ‘corny’ or ‘perfect’ or fantastical and nothing overly kinky nor.. I’m sure you get the idea. 

I’m more interested in works that at least have some art within, perhaps “mid-brow” (if that’s even a thing?)

Yes, tmi, I’m a virgin myself at 22 and no, I’m not ashamed of it. I’ve had my experience with a woman, though we never went any further.. I prefer to ‘give’ myself to someone I genuinely ache for... That’s not say anything poor about my previous lover, though. She truly was amazing. 

So, I’m more interested in something where maybe the man is less experienced than the woman, where she unveils a whole other realm of pleasure to him, exploring and growing together as go. Something between a couple with a lot of build up, tension, and intense/emotional pay off. 

There doesn’t even have to be that much sex happening, so long as the build up is as emotionally intense as the actual act. 

Though I do prefer a lot of high brow literature, the erotica certainly doesn’t have to be a masterpiece or anything, so long as it bears a soul (if that makes any sense?) 

I’d definitely prefer singular works, perhaps even short and sweet, but if the writings strong and emotional enough I definitely don’t mind a series (I’ll be starting The Vampire Chronicles here soon, just for some perspective).",11,bmvi5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/bmvi5q/erotic_literature_perhaps_from_a_male_perspective/

There was a mysterious motel room that was ripped from existence, and the only way to get to it was with the motel room key that could open any door and subsequently take you to any door in the world. There were also about a hundred other objects in the room that became imbued with incredible or mundane abilities.

  


  


  


The series revolved around an everyman who accidentally stumbles into this secret world of McGuffins and tries to use them selflessly to get his daughter back.

  


  


  


I'm looking for a series that has a similar feel. Maybe it has magical McGuffins, maybe it has similar elements of urban fantasy.

3023,Book recommendations for 12 year old avid reader who just lost her dad,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post and excuse my formatting, as I'm typing this on my phone. I'm kind of stuck and was hoping other bookish people might have some suggestions. A relative of my husband recently lost her husband very suddenly. He was pretty young and nobody expected it. Not only has he left his wife to grieve, but they have a 12 year old daughter who is now reeling with the loss of her father who she had a very close relationship with. 


Over the years, I've talked to her at family gatherings and holidays, mostly about books because her and I are the only ones in the family who read a lot. She convinced me to read the Harry Potter books, her favourite series. I really enjoyed reading them and might never have prioritized them on my reading list if she hadn't insisted. So I feel like the best way to show some support to her right now (other than being around and talking to her) might be to give her a new book or series to read. I expect the escape/distraction may be welcome. Or worst case scenario, she never reads it but hopefully feels that people care, at least.

I'm having a hard time figuring out what book or series to give her. I don't want it to be too on the nose, but I feel like a story with a relatable main character who ultimately triumphs or perseveres might be best. The only thing I can think of is The Secret Garden, which was my favourite book as a kid, though I know it's not every kid's cup of tea. And the beginning can be kind of bleak, which would not be great right now.

I'm hoping that someone out there might have some better suggestions. If you've been in her position, did any book or series bring you even a small amount of comfort?

I can’t recommend this book enough if you loved the Song of Ice and Fire books. I am 100 pages in and I am hooked. Set in feudal Japan, it has everything (except fantasy) GoT has. A huge cast of characters, all of which are shades of gray. None are pure good, or pure evil; they are believable humans with believable and unexpected actions. The violence and brutality is all there except with samurai. The beauty in the writing is there. The complicated story of intertwining families of lords and peasants all contributing to the overall plot, with that desire of rising themselves and family in status, nobility , and rank. To tie it all together, it is the length of a GoT book, with all the immersion, emotion, and addicting page turning found in the books as well. It’s also a series. I recently was recommended this as someone who is starving for the next book in GoT. I have to spread the word since someone might need this as much as I did. It’s considered a favorite for many people, and I was surprised I hadn’t heard of it. I have not been this excited for a story in a long, long time. Please, read this book if it appeals to you.

3149,I'm 15 and I haven't read a new book outside of school for many years. I need advice on what to read and how to start enjoying this form of entertainment again.," 

When I was younger I used to read a lot but over time I started reading less and less. Recently I've tried to get back into reading with books like Ready Player One, Slaughterhouse 5 and a few graphic novels but I lose interest quite quickly. The only time I am really enjoying reading these days is when I am rereading book series like Harry Potter and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

Some books I enjoyed when I was younger include **Harry Potter, The Hobbit, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, The Chronicles of Narnia, How to Train Your Dragon** (books) and **The Mysterious Benedict Society**. As you can probably tell, I preferred reading a series. The thing that I am looking for is that there are complex characters (**Harry Potter, How to Train Your Dragon**), good worldbuilding (**The Hobbit, The Chronicles of Narnia, How to Train Your Dragon**), an interconnected interesting story (**Harry Potter, How to Train Your Dragon and The mysterious Benedict society**) and for it just to be entertaining (The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy). Something I could read like half of in a day.

Here are some books that I am interested in reading.

* **Earthsea Cycle** \- Ursula K. Le Guin
* **The Chronicles of the Deryni** \- Katherine Kurtz
* **Discworld (Guards! Guards!)** \- Terry Pratchett
* **Neuromancer** \- William Gibson
* **Foundation** \- Isaac Asimov
* **The Neverending Stor**y - Michael Ende
* **Dhalgren** \- Samuel R. Delany
* **Nova** \- Samuel R. Delany
* **House of Leaves** \- Mark Z. Danielewski
* **Sandman Slim** \- Richard Kadrey
* **Good Omens** \- Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman
* **Neverwhere** \- Neil Gaiman

\- Which of these books do you think would be good for someone who is just getting back into reading and are there any  
others you think that I would enjoy?

\- What are some tips you have for getting back into reading?

3191,"Books to read *at* kids, while they fall asleep.","For a few years now, at bedtime, I've been reading to my kids as they go to sleep, and the drone of Daddy's reading shuts em off like a light. So I'm basically just reading to my wife, and we read stuff *we* want to read, like Harry Potter, ASOIAF, The Milkweed Trilogy, Pandora's Star, or the Passage. Now the boys are 3 and 5, and the older one especially is starting to comprehend more and more of what I read. Probably more than I think. I need books that are interesting to read for an adult, but doesn't contain anything gory or overly sexual for the kids. Adult themes and cursing is fine (I just say poop instead of shit, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

So ideally:

\- **Well written, and easily readable out loud**: Dune is a favorite of mine, but reading it out loud is a nightmare with all the jargon, and hard for my wife to follow while listening. Something of a natural cadence is appreciated, so no Cormac McCarthy etc.

\- **No graphic violence or sex unless it can easily be replaced on the fly:** For instance, a sex scene is easy enough for me to skip, but something like Game of Thrones that has important events or characterization during the violence is tough to navigate.

\- **Nerdy or fun**: We both naturally gravitate towards sci-fi and fantasy, but that's not required. More importantly,  we're not looking to dive into a depressing book at the end of the day, so something enjoyable.

I'm about to write my Bachelor's thesis on the unreliable narrator, the phenomenon where the narrator of the book is actively deceiving the reader. I've already read quite a number of these books, but none of them really fit for my thesis subject. I've also looked online for more guidance, but I've only really come across ""listicles,"" no real in-depth analyses yet of how the narrator is untrustworthy, exactly.  
I'd preferably like a book that's from the literary canon, as I can easily find more research and/or analyses on well-known authors than on authors that are relatively unknown. Also, if at all possible, books that contain proof of the narrator lying. For instance, Agatha Christie's *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* is problematic, because !the narrator reveals he'd been hiding the truth, but we never see how much, and what exactly he hid from us.! And similarly, *American Psycho* is difficult, because !because Bateman hallucinates a lot, the veracity of the murders themselves are questioned as well.! Ideally, I'd like a book where either someone else points out the narrator is lying, or at least it's easy to see (or deduce) which parts are lies and which aren't.

Usually, my preferred genres are fantasy, specifically high fantasy or philosophy based books/works from philosophers. I tried doing this with Breakfast of Champions, which I did enjoy.

Based on what I've read, what would you suggest that isn't like these ones? Sorry if this seems a little confusing or vague. Thanks in advance.

I mention her religion in the title; not because it needs to be a religious text per se, but to acknowledge her belief system when putting suggestions forward (ie- not something full of profanity). 

She is 30, has one son, and has mentioned to me that after losing her brother (who died by suicide) she felt like she has nothing left. She expressed that she felt as though she didn’t want to live, but she did and continues to, for her son.

She made concerning statements about how her life is only for her son (which I understand as a mother of 4), but my concern is that she too needs to feel happiness for herself, too. She has really put her own joy aside, and it seems to me that she has fallen out of love with herself.

In my opinion, you need to love yourself and be happy to be the best parent you can be, but I feel she’s really losing sight of that.

Can you suggest a book that might speak to her?

3300,Can someone recommend me more?," 

Hi,

I  come from a very conservative situation and wasn't allowed to read story books. Later when I was on my own in life I realized that books,  movies and music was the only way I could communicate or feel safe in  life.

My  first ever book was Deathly Hallows, I got to read it before the movie  came out and I was all in it for a week or so. Then the only other book I  got to read was Percy Jackson, the one where they explore a Labyrinth.  After that I haven't done much reading to be honest. Lately, I have been  forcing myself to pick up that habit again.

I  am reading The Perks of being a Wallflower at the moment and can't seem  to put it down. I feel connected to it because that was how I had to grow up, plus I had a very abusive home. At the moment I am so happy to have found this  book, I stopped loving the movie and started to only like it after I  began reading the book. :D The book feels to be more realistic and  intelligent.

Right now, I would like  someone to help me find more books like this to carry on with this momentum.  Also, I would love to cultivate this habit a bit further. If you have  any clue or need anymore detail, I shall be available here.

Please and thank you.",18,c6qsbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/c6qsbd/can_someone_recommend_me_more/

3310,Suggest me a book about controlling emotions...specifically procrastination.,"I never had a problem getting things done because fear was a big motivator for me (fear of my parents getting upset and me getting punished). I was also motivated and dreamt about having nice things in life (motivated me to study a lot).

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 years ago, when I turned 17 I started feeling ""meh"" about life and just coasting through it. Fear and drive don't exist for me anymore, and as a result I only do the bare minimum everyday in regards to work and studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a book that can help me learn strategies to get things done without relying on my emotions? Or a book that helps me overcome the ""meh"" feeling that prevents me from sticking to my commitments. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I started studying for the LSAT in 2013 and didn't stop until 2019 and never took the test. The ""fear-driven"" and ""highly-motivated"" me in the past would be appalled by my 6 year LSAT journey and not understand it. I would have felt a strong drive to avoid shame in the past, and that would have ensured I took the test in a timely manner, but like I mentioned before I mostly just feel ""meh"" all the time...except for when unkind people make fun of my procrastination, then I feel sad, but not motivated or driven.

What do you recommend?","My father is a baby boomer Republican, small business owner, and lives in the south. I appreciate the fact that he is asking for alternative views and looking to educate himself. 

(Sorry, this got long. I wanted to make sure that the book is something that is not going to be immediately objectionable. Hopefully the context helps. TL;DR at the bottom.) I 

He is a Republican for economic reasons, primarily. He is most vocal about how you don’t have to work in socialism, that the poor/lazy people just take from others, and he doesn’t want to support anyone except himself. He’s for small government and generally tends to himself for personal issues. (ie. He was okay with me being on birth control as a teenage girl, and was a foster parent for many years. Socially, he thinks your business is your own, but if you make “mistakes”, it’s also your problem to deal with.) 

He’s not particularly religious, but has indicated that, when social programs are necessary, places like churches and synagogues should take on that role. He has been fairly involved in any community he is a part of, and volunteers regularly. His multiple businesses have always had a community partnership aspect, whether hosting a show on local radio/tv to teach people about his field and how to do it yourself, or attending in person to aid those in need. 

Ideally, I would be able to find a book that lays out the hypocrisy in the Republican Party (impeach for a blowjob, but “grab them by the pussy”/rape allegations are okay; tax cuts are great, but only for the already rich; pay more money to corporations than you would to the government for the same task; Trump spending more money on personal expenses (golf) than any other president; etc). Information on the standard of living, expenses, and taxes may be beneficial to the explanation. 

^I don’t know if this book exists. 

He is very untrusting of anything that comes from the Internet, so solid sources and references would be nice. 

I would like the book to be anti-Trump without bashing republicans or saying that being a democrat is your only option. Something more academic may be appropriate, but a degree in law and/or polysci shouldn’t be necessary to understand it. 

Both of my parents claim the “product of their generation” as an excuse for things like “locker room talk” and often hold a double standard about young people. (AKA: Kavanaugh was just a kid when those things happened, it shouldn’t be held against him. But kids today have no respect and are too stupid to make good choices.) 

Again, I appreciate and respect the fact that he asked for these books on democratic socialism and anti-Trump. If you have any recommendations, I would absolutely love them. Thanks in advance!

3363,"Cozy, non-dense read that I can finish in a weekend?","I've been reading Game of Thrones lately and, while I'm enjoying it, it's dense and brutal and long and I'm looking to take a breather from it this weekend.

Length-wise, up to 350 pages is fine. I finished Room by Emma Donaghue in one day (during finals week too... it was a procrastination accident) so I should be good to finish a book that length in a weekend.

I'm down for any genre except romance. I'm also a bit fatigued with high fantasy atm so if it's fantasy, keep it a little less dense.

I know I said cozy in the title, but what I really mean is less mean to its characters than GoT (cozy is a plus though). Suffering is fine. Sadness and great adversity is fine. It's ok if it even goes a little dark at parts, but I'd prefer something that at least has characters that are good people at heart and a semi-hopeful ending. Some books I've liked in the past along the same lines:

- Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel

- The Princess Bride by William Goldman

- Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro (ok this one was a bit darker than what I'm looking for now)

- The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern

- Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card

- Stardust by Neil Gaiman

3364,Books about lonely women who AREN’T saved by a man,"Hey all,

I just finished &gt;!Eleanor Oliphant!&lt; and absolutely loved it. There were some things I didn’t like like the pacing and semi-predictable ending. However, I identified with &gt;!Eleanor!&lt; so much it brought me to tears. 

One major thing I didn’t necessarily care for was &gt;!Eleanor’s friendship with Raymond. I didn’t like how Raymond’s personality was essentially written to be absolutely perfect and it was predictable from the beginning that he would be the one who changes her.!&lt;

So, I ask: are there any books you can think of where the protagonist has similar issues with loneliness and lack of social skills like &gt;!Eleanor!&lt;, but there is no love storyline. Or, if there is, where the man is more realistic and not necessarily the main reason for the woman’s path to success.

5. No chosen one crap. (""Only **I** can understand the aliens because they abducted me two days ago and stuck a fish in my ear"").

Just two species sitting down and trying to figure each other out. Trying to translate each others language, navigating different behavior clues, what have you. Just trying to understand the details of the alien culture would be enough.

I know that is a rather specific criteria, but I'm hoping you guys can help me.

It had magic, thriller, suspense, action - which before, I didn’t know how it would work on writing but this book DELIVERED!! It was also funny and clever and the writing was superb - it kept me wondering about the prophecies all the way through the end.

I study English Literature and I had Greek Mythology as one of my classes.. but I learned more about Greek Mythology in this book than I have in school. The Gods, The Monsters, The Heroes, The Mythic Creatures, the entire universe.. I loved it all.

First day, I read 100 pages in one sitting - which I had never done before (reading 100 pages in a day, let alone in ONE SITTING).

Somewhere halfway through the book, I felt it was a little below my demographic - I’m 19 - and I thought it lacked philosophical and artistic depth.. and I still feel that way BUT I learned to read it for what it is and I enjoyed it.

Right after I finished, I fired up the movie.. idk what to say but, that movie need to seize existing forever.. I literally couldn’t finish watching it. I saw plenty of book-based movies (The Fault in Our Stars, A Man Called Ove, A Time to Kill) and they all did it justice; yes, they changed stuff and added others but they captured the essence.. But Percy’s movie is what I call a crime against humanity and Art.",25,ccsnvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/ccsnvb/finished_the_first_percy_jackson_recommended_by/

I’m looking for a fairly specific kind of book, hopefully you can help me out.

I was sent there by the police. The charges were ‘insulting the Sultan’ ; ‘insulting Islam/Muslims’ ; and ‘threatening the state’s security’ ... 

While there, my sister sent me the novel ‘1984’ by George Orwell, along with Nat Geo magazines and a Garfield strips collection book. Some of the staff brought me more books to read since reading was the best activity to ‘kill time’ while I was locked up.

After I was discharged, the police asked me to delete my tweets and sign an agreement to not post any negative remarks about the state’s affairs again. I signed the agreement and deactivated my twitter account.

Anyway, I read 1984 twice, and found that what is in the novel is exactly what I am trying to say or what I have already said in a different way- since I am in a way a version of a Winston trapped inside an Oceania.

But sometimes you just wanna read something that's like the literary equivalent of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. It's trash. You know it's trash. It's probably melting your brain as you read it. But they're easy and fun and sometimes that's what you need.

For me, it's VC Andrews books. Specifically her miniseries. They're never going to win a Pulitzer Prize (or at least I sure fucking hope not, they shouldn't) but I like the drama and girl-heavy casts and the messages about friendship and overcoming hardship and stuff.

I want to know how common this mindset is and how it’s developing.

3564,Can you recommend some modern military/recent alt-history fiction that isn't saturated with military jingoism?,"So, I'm a fan of fiction around the modern military and geopolitics. I love spy fiction, tense military focused stories about war and espionage, but I find myself continually frustrated with the right wing pro-war politics that seem to attach themselves to every Clancy or Thor novel. I guess John le Carré is a better choice, because the tone of his works seems to reflect a sort of 'Hey, war leads to mistrust of even your closest friends.' But I'm wondering what other options there are.

But I'm not looking for a post-apocalyptic novel. I don't want something that is locked into the idea of 'total war between U.S. and Soviets will end in everyone dead' or something like that. I know these stories already.

I think of stuff outside of novels, such as the Metal Gear franchise, which has a razor sharp focus on military hardware and technique, but has themes of deterrence, American Imperialism, and ideas around 'What is Patriotism?'

I'd be fine with some alternate history recommendations too, but nothing pre 1980s. Alternate Nazi/Civil War histories aren't interesting to me.

And I'm also not trying to start any fights. I'm not trying to devalue Clancy by attacking his politics.

&gt;Music journalist Evan Strocker has almost finished a book about his time with Heidegger Stairwell, a legendary indie-rock band. But the band thinks he's left a little too much of himself on the page—letting his experiences as a transgender man and his complicated ""romance"" with the lead guitarist eclipse the story of the group's dramatic rise and fall. **Through notes and marginalia, the musicians argue over their friend's version of the truth and fight to put their own testimony on record.**

I have read Stet by Sarah Gailey, a short story in which the fictional author of an article argues with her editor in the margins. But I don't know of anything else that uses this technique, or even what it's called.

I've read most of the other Poirot books and a few others by Agatha Christie and I liked them for the most part but I still haven't found something that was quite what I was looking for. The things I really liked that I'm looking for in another book were:

1.	The isolated atmosphere: For the duration of the mystery everyone was trapped together, there was no escape, and no outside help. I particularly like the idea of a vehicle like a train or a boat, but anything could work. 
2.	The mystery was solvable, though difficult: the same clues given to the detective are given to the reader, and while it wasn't easy it was possible to piece them together. 
3.	The story wasn't bogged down by excess fluff: there were moments of character and atmosphere building, both of which contributed to the story and made the line between core and red herring uncertain, but fundamentally the conflict of the book was the eponymous murder and it's solution and the book stuck to it. 
4.	A similar tone would be rather nice if possible, though I'm flexible on this one.

I've also explored a lot of awesome new books/genres in this way that I may have been apprehensive to pick up if I had known what they were beforehand.  So any suggestions are welcome.

3596,A book for my dad,"My dad has worked the same job since he was 13 years old. He worked for my grandfather, then assumed the family business in his thirties. In all, he has been working a physically demanding, high stress (contract work) job for nearly 50 years. He is struggling with aging and losing the energy of his youth right now. I think he feels as if his value extends only as far as his capability to work hard. I wish he would see how much my siblings and I honor and revel in his efforts. We truly look at his life's work with awe. Who can honestly work a job as demanding as he has for 50 years? I really want him to find comfort in his being.

I would like to find a book for him that will help him be proud of what he has accomplished. He has put my sisters and I through college and become highly respected in his field of work for the quality and depth of knowledge he and his company offers. 

I think of many Asian philosophies that encapsulate honor and pride in perfecting one's practice, no matter what that practice may be. 

Is there a book on this type of philosophy, or a similar philosophy, that would help him take comfort and pride in the depth of his work?

The movie made it seem like they might do a sequel for Murder on the Nile but I am also curious about Poirot's earlier cases that lead him to the train. I have also read that the Murder of Rodger Akroyd is one of the finest of Agatha's works but am curious if there is benefit to read them in order. Ideally I would like to read some mysteries that have a movie made as that really helps me put the images in my mind on the screen but I have seen the new Sherlock movies already so I may have already spoiled myself. Any recommendations?",345,cxqby7,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/cxqby7/i_just_finished_murder_on_the_orient_express/

3833,Looking for some easy-to-read novels in between the denser required reading for my lit class,"If anyone could help me out, that'd be great! I'm looking for something to read on the side so I don't get overwhelmed by the difficult reading for my literature class. I'd love stuff that's easy to read, but not childish (for example, the narration of the Percy Jackson series irritates me, which is disappointing because it was one of my favorites when I was a kid but I just can't handle rereading it).

I'm open to just about anything. Psychological thrillers and mindfuck-type books are also appealing to me, but I don't like the kind of mystery novel in which it's just one case from start to finish like a police procedural, as they tend to be less fast-paced than I'd like. I'm partial to fantasy novels, and I wouldn't mind getting my feet wet with the horror genre.

Bonus points for books that'll make me cry, books I won't want to put down, books with LGBT characters (but not centered around their LGBT identity), and books with magical elements.

Stuff I don't like:
* gritty stories with little to no humor or are just heavy all the way through
* themes about racism, politics, or sexual identity (sorry, im not cultured and it just doesnt hold my attention)
* the kind of girls in John Green books. you know the kind
* books that rotate POVs or have multiple narrators (sometimes it's alright, but i prefer to stick with one narrator if possible. 3rd person limited is my favorite. it just makes it harder for me to keep track of plotlines, and it's the reason i never finished ASOIAF)

3844,Help Creating 'The Ultimate Speculative Fiction Reading List',"Recently, I acquired a position in a university English Department that's trying to expand the number of students enrolling as English/Lit majors. Part of their strategy is to provide a wider range of minors specifically catered to reading interests and genre-fiction. Upon completion of Core Classes, for example, English/Lit majors can now focus entirely on Classical Lit., Contemporary Lit., Mysteries, Romance, YA, LBGTQ+, Horror, etc. - whatever interests them.

And I have the privilege of building the Speculative Fiction curriculum, with particular emphasis on Sci-Fi and Fantasy.

I want our students to understand what distinguishes Sci-Fi/Fantasy Literature as an art form, but from the perspective of ***writers*** in these genres, not purely from the English/Lit perspective that focuses on readers analyzing, theorizing and categorizing. I want students to understand craft, how to improve their own writing and, in particular, I want students to get excited about what's out there. To connect with the authors and stories that will ignite their passion to read deeper, wider, and to write more. And, hopefully, to then pay that passion forward.

I have 12 months to develop my curriculum. But I have several problems that might best be understood if one were to imagine this scenario: Say I have a class of 18 students and we're talking about tropes. 1 student is into high fantasy and has never read anything else. 3 only read hard sci-fi and think fantasy is the worst thing in existence. Another 2 are hyper-critical fans of lets say NK Jemisin and will drop the class immediately if I don't communicate info about tropes specifically through the lens of NK Jemisin. Another 5 are complete newbies to speculative fiction and have no idea what they like, but are open-minded and willing to read anything - they're just looking for a new experience. 3 are only there because they figured the sci-fi/fantasy classes would be easier to pass than those for a minor in Classical Lit. And 4 are extremely well read but aren't getting much of anything from the class because of the aforementioned 5 newbies having questions that could've easily been answered after several minutes on a sub-Reddit like this...

Essentially, I need to keep a group of people with a wide range of tastes and reading experiences engaged in a way that allows them all to participate in the dialogue while still appealing to everyone's specific interests. This is not an uncommon struggle among educators. So, I had the idea of gearing all reading lists and assignments (basically the entire curriculum)  ***specifically*** *to each student*. Determined by (1) the focus of the class, and (2) their individual reading experience, interests, and goals.

So, for example, say I have a class that focuses on Prose. Student #1 is not very well read but interested in the steampunk sub-genre. Student #2 is very well read and looking for some esoteric novels about Time Travel. Student #3 is well read in high-fantasy but wants to explore Dystopian Fiction. I'd like to be able to satisfy them all with great stories that have fantastic prose in each of these genres - the kinds of stories that will get them excited to read more. But to do that I need YOU, Redditors.

And here's how you can help; I need as many recommendations and suggestions as possible in order for me to create a master reading list for myself and my students. I have by no means read everything, and want to be sure that if a student comes to me asking fora soft military sci-fi, raygun-punk, or a comic-fantasy, that I have a plenty of ***quality*** material for them to enjoy. I want to be the best resource I can be.

So, below is a list of many Sci-Fi and Fantasy Sub-genres. It is by no means exhaustive, and I understand that some stories will have obvious overlaps that fall into many of these categories at once. I am hoping that, with each comment/suggestion, you may simply copy and fill out the following info:

* **Title**:
* **Author**:
* **Sub-Genre(s)**:
* **Form** (Novel or short story):
* **Biggest strength(s)** (prose/style, characters, setting/world-building, plot, conflict/resolutions, themes &amp; symbolism):

# Fantasy Sub-Genres:

Children's, Comic, Dark/Gothic, Gaslamp, Grimdark, Fairy Tale, Heroic (Sword and Sorcery), High/Epic, Low, Historical, Magical Realism, Medieval, Mythological, Noir, Paranormal, Romance, Science-Fantasy, Urban, Weird or New-Wierd, Western, YA, Xeno

# Sci-Fi Sub-Genres:

20 Minutes into the Future, Alien, Alternate Dimension/Universe, Speculative Biology, Documentary, Dying Earth, Hard Sci-Fi, Military, New Wave, Planetary Romance, Post-Singularity, Punk-Punk\*\*\*, Soft Sci-Fi, Space Opera, Space Western, Teslatopia, Time Travel, Transhumanist, Video Game

\*\*\*Categories of Punk:

* Atom, Bio, Cape, Clock, Cyber, Diesel, Gothic, Post-Cyber, Raygun, Ocean, Sandal, Solar, Steam, Stone

# Other/Misc. Speculative Fiction Genres:

Apocalyptic Fiction, Dystopia, Horror, Post-Apocalypse, Supernatural, Utopia

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, my goal is to have 10-15 solid novels and 5-10 short stories for EACH of these sub-genres. Do the math and, at 10 books per sub-genre, I'm looking to create a list of at least 600 novels.

For anyone interested... after all my suggestions come in, and some considerable research is done, I will be following up this post with the actual master-list of ""the essential/best titles"" for each of these sub-genres. Essentially, an Ultimate Speculative Fiction Reading list.  I want to make this resource available to as many people as possible, and with just one suggestion you can make a valuable contribution to this list!

3894,The Count of Monte Cristo &amp; learning history through fiction,"One of my all-time favorite books is The Count of Monte Cristo. I love how one can learn a good bit of history throughout reading it. It is largely grounded in historical fact and often references real people and events. I even actually enjoy the lengthy footnotes that might explain a reference to an important historical figure, or anything else a modern reader might not understand immediately. These notes and references often lead me to Wikipedia to gain an even better understanding. The fact that a lot of the history was about politics (French Revolution, Napolean) made it all the better for me.

I would love to be able to have similar experiences again. I initially assumed I was looking for 'Historical Fiction' but learned The Count wouldn't even technically be considered that genre due to it being written during the time of its setting, and have been at a loss as to how to find more. Has anyone else liked this aspect of The Count and does anyone have any suggestions for more?

bonus example - Not a book but also displays what I am talking about pretty well. The anime series Rurouni Kenshin, set in the early Meiji Era of Japan. The series stays true to this era of transition for Japan. I'd even say a secondary theme of the whole series is the existentialism of the accelerated cultural shift at the time.",496,d53vmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/d53vmc/the_count_of_monte_cristo_learning_history/

So, my question is would someone not clearly the target demographic of this book still enjoy it?",30,d78g20,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/d78g20/would_a_19_year_old_guy_like_the_handmaids_tale/
3923,"I hope this post is allowed, but what’s your favorite way to read on a budget?","I recently was asked by a friend how I can afford to read as much as do. She was shocked at how many ways I get my hands of books most of the time for no more than a few dollars. She loves to read as well and had no idea about the resources I use, and I’m sure there’s other resources that I don’t know about either. So hopefully this post is allowed. I would love to know how everyone else gets reading material for cheap (or free!). 

Here’s my list: 

[Brooklyn Public Library ](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/) allows non residents to apply for a library card, which will give you access to their complete ebook collection. It’s a huge selection. Huge. The non resident fee for a library card is $50 and it is all due at once. This is a steep up front cost, but the ebook selection is amazing. 

[Kindle Unlimited ](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?pd_rd_w=LroBt&amp;qid=1569051356&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_wg=7oL8H&amp;pd_rd_r=d71dae08-be1a-4842-a655-016a76ae9269&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true) is probably the most well known subscription style service for books. There’s usually an introductory rate, but the standard cost is $9.99 a month and you get unlimited access to all the books that are available under the program. Unfortunately, I’ve never found the Kindle Unlimited library very satisfying. It’s largely lesser known and sometimes self published books. I’ve never found a best seller there. To compare it to Brooklyn Public Library, it’s more than double the price (over the course of a year) with a severely limited selection. 

[BookBub](https://www.bookbub.com/welcome) is more of a newsletter type of deal. You select the genres you are interested in, and they give you a list of books in those genres that are I think $3.99 or less for the ebook. I’m putting $3.99 to be safe, but I honestly can’t think of anything it’s shown me that was more than $2.99. There’s also lots of free options, usually where book one of a series is free to get you hooked and willing to purchase the sequels. Most of the time, these are lesser known and self published authors as well, but when best sellers run sales, those end up in here too. There’s an app on iOS but I’m not sure about Android. 

[ThriftBooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com/) is for those who want the hard copy in your hand. They sell used books (including text books) for as low as $3.99. Free shipping on orders $10 or more. I’ve found their classification of used books (like new, good, acceptable, etc) to be very accurate. The have a reading rewards program where once you spend a certain dollar amount you get a free book. 

[BookDepository](https://www.bookdepository.com/) is very similar to ThriftBooks. They sell used books, but I’ve found that their prices run just slightly higher than ThriftBooks. However, there’s free international shipping. Anyone not in the US might be able to find some great prices here. Every order I’ve ever placed comes with a cute bookmark designed by a reader and chosen in their competition for bookmark designs. 

[Paper Back Swap ](https://www.paperbackswap.com/home.php) is a little different. For this website you need hard copy books that you own that you no longer want to keep. You post them on the website and other users who want that book can request it from you. You ship it to them using USPS Media Mail (most books ship for less than $4 or 5). Once they receive the book, you get a credit to request a book from someone else. For first time users, I think you need to post 10 or 20 books and you’ll receive 2 free swaps to use right away. From then on you get swaps every time you send a book out. You can get audiobooks here as well, and there’s a sister site for DVDs. This is only available to US locations, however. 

Your Local Library!! Every library has an ebook collection, as far as I know. With just your ID or proof of residence, you can have access to the physical books in the library as well as their ebook selection. Many libraries will also transfer books from another branch if there’s a specific book you want that they don’t have that moment. In my experience, librarians are kind and helpful and would love to do that service for you. Your taxes pay for amenities like this, so use them! They want you to!

3925,Where do I start reading about history when I have basically 0 knowledge of the past?,"Hi all! I want to start reading about our history, from the beginning of civilization to events that happened just 10 years ago. Generally, every time I pick up a book they would cross reference their contents to another thing that happened somewhere else that I have never heard of. 

Of course I could just pick up another book to better understand the reference. But then do I read the new book? Or continue my old one? 

Right, so I want to start from as far back as I need to to gain a deeper understanding of our world, the timeline I want to explore is like this: 

-Ancient Civilizations (I.e Egypt, Rome, Greece, China etc) 
-Medieval Times (...are the bronze and dark ages part of this time frame too?) 
-Renaissance 
-Industrial Revolutions 
*And any significant wars throughout the timeline 

Basically I’m asking two questions: 
1. How can this timeline be changed to include more events? 
2. What interesting books do you guys recommend that falls in one of the categories of the timeline?

I have read all of Nabokov and Murakami and I think they both generally fit the tone that I am looking for here, especially ""Laughter in the Dark"" and ""After Dark.""

Let me know if I need to clarify further! I feel like I have been really vague and all over the place. That, or someone is gonna say ""weirdly enough, I know just the book for you!"" lol. I'd be extra

after a long time of not reading anything I just finished ""Pans-Labyrinth-Faun"" and im hooked with reading again.

4047,For a fatherless and troubled young man,"My nephew is witty, intelligent, kind hearted, and I believe, very wise beyond his years. Unfortunately, in the short life he's lived so far, he's been dealt tremendously tough hands. 

When he was 8 years old he found his dad passed away from a drug overdose. When he was 12, he walked in on his mom's boyfriend sexually molesting his little sister. He's experienced bullying, CPS investigations, numerous homes, and has never had any structure or consistency shown to him outside of when he stays with me or his grandparents.

Even though his grades don't currently reflect it, he has always been smart. I've witnessed him ace tests without studying for them, and read books and actually absorb meaning from them. 

I know that as much as I want to snatch him away from his present group of ""friends"" in an effort to save him from a life of petty crime and poverty, I can't save him. As his Aunty, I know that my influence becomes more limited as time passes, and I can't (and won't) actually force him to read a book. His life and his lessons are his to live and learn from. 

Regardless, I'm encouraged by the fact that he still feels comfortable enough to voluntarily share thoughts with me every now and then, and I've always had faith in a really good book. 

Any suggestions?

- a very beautifully illustrated children's book about the German Army in WWI from 1914 which is actually horrible when you think about it but also incredibly fascinating, what with the war euphoria back then (Vater ist im Kriege - Father is in the War)

I know there’s also the Court of Thorns and Roses by the same author, but somebody told me it was very different so I haven’t read it. A friend told me to read the Kingkiller Chronicle books, and while good they just weren’t the same. The global war, assassination and subterfuge, tension between different countries and plot twists around every corner just made Throne of Glass something special for me. Anything the even ticks a single box will be appreciated, I’m always looking for something new to read.",255,divrxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/divrxz/throne_of_glass_is_my_favourite_series_of_all_time/
4089,Book suggestions for my dad,"My dad is turning 60 in November. He asked me to get him a book for his birthday- I'd like to get him several because he has very particular taste and I'd like to hit at least 1 home run with this. He has primarily read murder mysteries for the last 20 years, but recently told me that he's ""worn out the usual mystery stuff."" I'd like to get him some titles that will push on his comfort zone but still be enjoyable (it's a gift, after all!). 

I think it would be fun to get a set of books that sit somewhere on the bizarre/creepy spectrum- sort of an Unnerving Bookshelf. So far, my ideas are: Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer, Geek Love by Katharine Dunn, and Swamplandia by Karen Russell. It's ok for a book to be more bizarre than creepy or vice versa.

Also, if it helps, here are some titles that I know he enjoyed: The Hitchhiker's Guide by Douglas Adams, The Martian by Andy Weir (but not the latest by the same author), In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson, and he is a huge fan of Heinlein (like all dads). He's not that interested in domestic thrillers/dramas or fantasy. I'd be so grateful for any ideas!",11,diz3o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/diz3o4/book_suggestions_for_my_dad/

4136,Sci-fi book with magic (or very advanced science... AKA how ever they flavour it),"Greetings

As in the title I am interested in some space story or even terrestrial which in addition to having highly advanced technology has a strong emphasis on magical or ""so high level of science it could be considered a magic (for lesser beings)"". Alien tech and all such are good to go (specially if the aliens are very alien not just coloured humanoids). But I would just highly prefer that book to be mature in themes: not grimdark *per se*, but just that no topic that should come up isn't embellished nor mellowed ""for rating purposes"".

Things I dislike to see: Chosen One; just constant war where each side is one-upping each other constantly and plot only revolving around war; prophecy; ""bad guys"" just being generic evil faction; teenage angst; fight-the-system.

PS: the high tech can potentially be also steampunk or cyberpunk, but I would prefer more traditional sci-fi.

PPS: I would like it not be some 100-book series as they usually lose its plot rather quickly or just make it tedious to follow.

PPPS: If the story is covered from multiple viewpoints and different sides is also a plus.

4163,One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest," 

Gents and ladies,

I  make no apologies for this rant, but I just want to express my feelings  at this late, late hour, that a book really, really can change your  life.  In this particular instance, I speak of course of the novel  written in my title, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, by Ken Kesey.   Though I'm sure it can apply to any novel folks get a connection with.

Personally,  I read this book while in bed as a 14 year old boy while living in  central Tripoli in Libya, since my father worked there, and it really  changed my life.  I did't read much to be honest when I was a kid, but  this really spoke to me to the point that I even remember the cover art.   At school you're forced to read tripe that you don't enjoy, but that's  not reading.  If you aren't enjoying a book, put it down and read  something else.  It is that simple.

I  recall reading this book, and thinking ""this is unlike anything I have  ever experienced"", to the point that I am still thinking about it twenty  years later and it informs my opinions about things.  If you are a kid  and not really interested in reading etc, I can't recommend this enough.   This comes from the bottom of my heart.

I  read the version off the book the Jack Nicholson on the cover in  orange, then watched the film afterward, and that's the best way in my  opinion.  Nothing tops the book if you buy into it.  With the machine  and all that.  The film has a different message, but both are equally  important.

I  really don't know how to conculde this.  Im not even American, though I  want to be someday, just go out and buy this book and read it  goddamnit.",11,dnn5xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/dnn5xv/one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest/

Mine:

- The Life of Pi. Read recently after meaning to for years. A boy gets stranded alone in the ocean on a lifeboat with a tiger, zebra and orang-utan for nearly a year.

- Girls Burn Brighter. Set in India and moving to the US, two young girls bond, are separated and endure horrific events that reveal the darker side of modern India but the spark inside them.

- Veronika Decides to Die. I find most of Coehlo's novels a bit preachy but enjoyed this because of the premise of a girl deciding to kill herself cos she's bored with life.

Basically, Coraline. I'm looking for more books like Coraline. Some other favorites of mine include The Giver, The Wondla trilogy, and Cirque Du Freak. Maximum fun also kind of falls into this category, but that was a little too YA romance for my liking.

Obviously these aren't all horror, but can still contain heavy themes such as post-apocalypses or distopias. They don't have to be meant exclusively for young readers also, just something not so reliant on adult themes.

I will just add some more details to what I'm looking for. I would prefer not to feel too sad; some occasional sadness is okay, if feeling sad is not the main theme of the book. It can be a book about romance, if it is sufficiently interesting for someone who never reads romances (maybe would be better if there was something else going on besides the couple trying to be together and etc).

4202,"Just now getting into reading, looking for the best easy to read books to introduce me to the book world","I used to love reading back in early middle school, but then school just kept getting harder and harder and I wasn't able to do it anymore. I'm a senior in high school now and I'm just now realizing how hard it is for me to not have something I can just shut everything out and just do for my own pleasure. 2 weeks ago, I was at the library and since my computer ran out of charging to do homework I started browsing and found When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanathi and was blown away. It was like I got a missing piece in the bleak and dull routine that was my life. After I finished that book, I got on this subreddit and have been lurking since.

I'm wondering if anyone could give me suggestions on ""easy"" read books that still are powerful and amazing. I don't know much about history so if you suggested a book on a historical topic that isn't common knowledge I'm afraid I won't understand it. That's why I'm so scared of venturing out for more books. I'm really afraid I won't understand the language and that I won't understand the references of the content, and that I won't be able to actually finish it.

If anyone could help me with some good book recommendations based on what I've said, I would truly appreciate it!

4232,Looking for some fantasy suggestions,"I used to read a LOT when I was younger. And always enjoyed the fantasy genre the most.

A few of my favourite books and authors were:

-Christopher Paolini's ""Eragon"" series (Inheritance Cycle)

-Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" Trilogy (The golden Compass)

-Rick Riordan's ""Percy Jackson"" 

Unfortunately over time I'd slowly stopped reading as much as I used to. And for the last few years have read very little.

But this week I just watched the first episode of ""His Dark Materials"" and I felt incredibly emotional about it. 
After the film adaptation of ""The Golden Compass"" was incredibly disappointing, and the ""Eragon"" movie actually made me cry at the time, simply from how it utterly made a mockery of a story and world I'd been so invested in through the books, this was just beautiful.

His dark materials is the first thing i've ever seen that has really brought a fantasy world to life in such a vivid, beautiful way, and one that for me anyway, was incredibly close to how I envisioned things whilst reading the book. 

Harry potter the books are better, but the movies are good.

Eragon the books I loved, and the movie was just a joke. I didn't just not enjoy it, I literally CRIED from how upset I was (though I was younger at the time).

But this, its just beautiful. 

&amp;nbsp;

It filled me with those wonderful feelings you only get when you are submerged and invested in a world as beautiful as the one Phillip Pullman created, and I realised then just how much I missed that.

And so, I'm really wanting some more book suggestions.

Firstly I'm going to re-read the subtle knife, and then the amber spyglass (As I never actually got the opportunity to read that)

But I'd really love some suggestions of books that might appeal to someone who enjoyed the books mentioned above.

There are many books with elves and dwarves and aliens and in most of them their culture, thinking process and general being is rather ""different aspects of humans"". And that is not overly interesting to read for me.

So what I am asking here is books which include few or more dominant sentient species who either live together in same place (be it land, planet or galaxy) or have at least rather frequent meetings to make the existence of the other relatively common knowledge. But it all should make sense sociologically and anthropologically or xenobiologically: where do they come from, are they just ""colored humans"" or something else entirely, is mutually beneficial connection even possible thanks to the tremendous differences in value/ethic systems (and if not, how do they avoid war and genocide), do they even realize there is another species because they look so, well, alien?

Good example for me would be Barnaby Rudge by Dickens, since everybody knows about Great Expectations and David Copperfield, yet Barnaby Rudge is somewhat underappreciated when compared to those two novels imo





(My Favorite books of all time are Blood Meridian,1984, and Crime and Punishment if it helps)

4257,Books for each mood,"Books when you feel angry at the world and all you wish for is an apocalypse: Things we lost in the Fire by Mariana Enriquez- Well, this is not a feeling we accept to others, but sometimes when the rage becomes uncontrollable, Things we lost in the Fire is perfect to read while indulging in your revenge fantasy. This short story collection is diabolically dark and has such an unsettling magic that you will be afraid to continue with the next story, yet you'll not be able to put it down.


When you are melancholy and confused at the same time: Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami- There is a lingering sadness in each page of the book like a needle pricking your skin which you cannot locate. This novel is especially best if you read it during winter wearing gloves and your breath rising as a silvery wisp.

When you've had enough of other people's BS: Circe by Madeline Miller: Nothing speaks empowerment than an overlooked witch in classical Greek tragedies who's made a heroine of her own right by the delightful pen of Madeline Miller. It has such an engaging plot and a strong but vulnerable character who we can't help but root for.

When you are melancholy but introspective: The Gift of Rain by Tan Twan Eng- The Gift of Rain is a hauntingly beautiful tale set in the backdrop of Japanese invasion of Malaya. The imagery is gorgeous and the characters are beautifully complex. The plot has multiple layers of survival, mysticism, family and love. If you can read just one book from this list, this is the one. 

When you've lost faith in humanity:
1. Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed- This is a gem of a book which will restore your faith in the beauty of being human. Extracted from the column Dear Sugar on Rumpus, each letter and its answer will make you cry, laugh or sometimes both.

2. This Modern Love by Will Darbyshire- There is just one word for it- Heartwarming.

3. Chicken Soup for the Soul: Women to Women

4. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom: Book that will never fail to make you cry.

When you're stuck in your sweltering small town and it makes you claustrophobic: Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn- Diabolically, wicked women who'll make your skin crawl whom you can't help but secretly wish to be like them.

When you want to get lost in a good story during midsummer- The Lake House by Kate Morton- Reading Kate Morton's novels is going back to the old days gone with the wind. The Lake House is a delightful novel to read with an engaging plot which surprises you.

When you are more than interested in the forbidden secrets of your town: Into The Water by Paula Hawkins- It has an autumnal feel with all its mystery and secrets. Add to it, all those witchy references!

When you just want to escape your real life: Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern- The descriptions are enchanting and the book makes a great autumnal read if you want the taste of a fairytale of grown ups.",12,ejthpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/ejthpw/books_for_each_mood/

4308,Fantasy that isn’t drowned in description?,"I have aphantasia, which means I can’t see pictures in my head, but I still love reading. It does, however, make reading things that prioritize long and flowery descriptions such a chore, though.

I’m pretty underread in fantasy. I read *A Game of Thrones* a few years back and found myself loving the characterization and dialogue and... practically everything except the prose itself. Sorry, Martin, don’t care about what they had for breakfast, especially not for four pages. I tried reading *The Fellowship of the Ring* a while back too and found it to be a complete bore.

Are there any Hemingways or Vonneguts of the fantasy realm? I get that by the nature of the worlds they’re setting up, they have to indulge in a little more worldbuilding than other genres, but are there any fantasy authors that prioritize characterization, theme, and tone over endless description?

4311,Fiction reads with similar themes to Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens?,"\*Disclaimer: If this post ruffles any feathers, I promise I won't be offended if you just keep scrolling. I'm really just looking for reading suggestions, not trying to start an ideological argument online. I trust that we can keep it civil :) 

Just started reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari after eyeing it for ages and this section toward the end of the first chapter really sparked my imagination:

""Imagine how things might have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans survived alongside Homo sapiens. What kind of cultures, societies and political structures would have emerged in a world where several different human species coexisted? How, for example, would religious faiths have unfolded? Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the Denisovans, and would the Qur’an have reserved seats in heaven for all righteous humans, whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have been able to serve in the Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy of imperial China? Would the American Declaration of Independence hold as a self-evident truth that all members of the genus Homo are created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged workers of all species to unite?”

Does anyone know of any fiction that uses this idea? Any novels about Homo sapiens coexisting with Neanderthals? I would imagine this would likely be a sci-fi type novel, but I'm open to any ideas.",17,g3vite,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/g3vite/fiction_reads_with_similar_themes_to_yuval_noah/

* Anna Karenina by Tolstoy
* A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving
* Freedom by Jonathan Franzen
* The Razor's Edge by W. Somerset Maugham 
* Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card

So now I have a few hours to suggest 3 maybe four books to her to bring to her book club of similarly situated white women that will “do the most good.”

They aren’t racist (or at least not overtly/conscously) really just a bunch of white ladies who live in the mountains and whose lives aren’t normally touched by these issue.

The stipulations are that it has to be fiction, not too long (I’m taking this to mean no more than 300 pages or so), and something with enough mass market appeal to grab them but will also lead towards a greater kinship with black lives matter and the black community in general. I have some good books in my library, kindred by octavia butler, paradise by Toni Morrison, Mama Day by Gloria Naylor but those are just my favorites and I’m hoping someone smarter than me will have some good suggestions I can pass along.

 Now I would like to read a book that is sentimental but also thought-provoking and makes you feel content.

It played into those cravings for exploration and starting my new life and it made me SO EXCITED TO LIVE! 

fast forward almost three years and a book has yet to inspire me that much again. A lot changed and I no longer really resonate with the message, But the feeling of reading it, like I was right alongside the characters and feeling like life was so big and full of possibilities, I want that again. I have some other Kerouac books , but it just isn’t the same 

I’m looking for something that makes you want to just get up and run away, make yourself better, live in the world. When I read On The Road it correlated with a very specific feeling in my life where it was like a roller coaster and I was right on the edge about to go down, like I was on the edge of my seat so excited for the rest of my life 

Just something introspective, that makes you want to be more than yourself, but also reads like a fast paced high energy adventure.

4425,Books with a supernatural element that is handled/explored rationally?,"I love stories that are set in our real world, except there's a supernatural twist that's unexplained at first, but the character(s) explore it, test its limits, discuss it, ponder the philosophical/societal rammifications of something like this. It can also be a religious-themed thing, as long as it's not overtly preachy

I like when the supernatural ""rules"" are basically set in the premise of the story, and everything follows logically while still being a surprise somehow. Basically no hidden rules/twists that are made up as the story progresses.

The best example I can think of is *The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August*. Guy relives his life when he dies, that's it. But he explores it a whole bunch and there's so many philosophical discussion about what it means.

Another good example would be the manga/anime Death Note, where L investigates everything and reaches rational conclusions despite the inexplicable supernatural element of criminals just dropping dead",14,huui4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/huui4r/books_with_a_supernatural_element_that_is/

4439,Easing into philosophical literature,"posted in /r/philosophy but no responses.

I hope others can relate to the problem that I occasionally have when reading the likes of Nietzsche, Camus, Marcus Aurelius etc.

When I dive into these philosophical works, I generally find myself having difficulty following or grasping the core themes and/or 'point' they are trying to make. The language and structure a lot of the time comes across as extremely complex and hard to follow, and I wonder if I am missing some fundamental skills or vocabulary necessary to absorb it all in.

Nonetheless, you have to start somewhere, right? I recently read Thus Spoke Zarathustra and was equal parts confused and intrigued/sucked in. In the moments of clarity, it felt like peeking through a door to something beautiful, though something I could not fully grasp; the occasional passages which clicked in my head for whatever reasons were enough to provide me with the drive to finish it and an ultimately thought-provoking experience, though I still felt as though I was missing most of what is being said.

Is there any recommended reading for those like myself who have dabbled in philosophical literature, that would make the journey forward more clear? Some 'entry-level' pieces of work that might set a good foundation for more abstract works? Or perhaps just pushing through is the answer.

Thank you.

4495,looking for books like White Collar/The Mentalist/Psych,"I used to enjoy those USA network procedural shows and I'm looking for books to match the goofy but sometimes serious tone. I like stories that have a partner or sidekick to the main character. Relationships are fine and Bromance is appreciated. Also where the main  character is extraordinary or special in some way that helps with an investigation or plot line. 

Some examples of shows are:

White Collar: Neal and Peter.  They start off cop and criminal but develop a friendship throughout. Neal is a criminal which sets him apart from most characters. 

The Mentalist: Patrick Jane and Lisbon. Jane is intelligent and good at psychology. Lisbon and him are partners

Sherlock: Sherlock and John Watson become great friends. Sherlock is a highly intelligent detective

Psych: Shawn and Gus are friends and work partners. Shawn is very observant and able to solve cases effectively 

Chuck: Chuck literally has a computer in his head. Him and Sarah grow a relationship throughout. 

Doctor Who: Usually always a companion involved). The Doctor is an alien.

From my examples, at least one of the characters has a special characteristic that is abnormal and there is a partner/friend/girlfriend that helps them along. 

I don't mind the genre. I enjoy crime, fantasy, etc. As long as the tone is both fun and serious. It can be more one then the other, but I don't want an all serious story.

What one sees as an abomination that must be supressed, another sees as something that can be good, or even necessary.  It's the sort of thing that could (and almost does) drive them to despise each other, except that greater needs serve to keep them together.

* The Night Circus
* The Traveling Cat Chronicles
* Geek Love
* A Song of Fire and Ice series
* Assassin's Apprentice
* Outlander
* Frankenstein
* The Ritual
* Gone with the Wind
* Jane Eyre

My best friends 13 year old daughter has recently come out. She is so mature for her age, she's always reminded me of me when I was younger because I was very academic and loved reading as a hobby and so does she, so we've discussed books together since she was about 10, her reading age is probably the same as mine in my 30s!

As I said she's recently come out and she is such a strong independent young lady but she really struggled to tell her mum (my best friend) because all of her friends and family are predominantly straight, even though she knows and it's always been made clear love is love and we would love her no matter what! But she did struggle, because she felt she was going against the norm.

I've always given her a book for Christmas since she was about 7. But this year I'm thinking how when I was a teenager the typical teenage books were ""girl likes boy"" or vice versa. I want to get her something with characters she can relate to! Something age appropriate of course but preferably where the main character likes someone of the same sex. 

I have told her I'm proud of her (not for coming out because I don't even think that should be a thing these days, but I'm proud she is so self assure to know who she is at 13 because at her age I was just trying to please everyone!) and that I'm always here, but we've always related through books and I'd just like to buy her a book she can relate to at this stage in her life.

But because I have to read so much now, I stopped reading anything for pleasure. I mostly opt to easier distraction like watching Netflix or gaming.
I think I should mention I'm a pretty slow reader, so reading all the texts from university takes up a lot of time and concentration.

However, I want to find a book that I can read for pleasure and  that's kinda chill and easy. It just shouldn't have too many pages/words in a chapter - or at least many points where I could stop reading - so I don't feel 'forced' to read on even though I'm exhausted. It should focus more on characters and dialogue/thoughts then visual descriptions. Also the topics should not be too complicated, although it's allowed to be thought-provoking and emotional. I think it's easier if I give some examples of books that are like what I have in mind:

The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger
The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro
The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky
The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa

I grew up with bipolar family members, and reading Kay Redfield Jamison's books ""An Unquiet Mind"" and ""Touched by Fire"" has been both illuminating and a balm for the loneliness of going through something that most of my offline contacts either are unable to relate to, or unable to articulate. If I could find a book that does the same for my current situation of being a caregiver to a depressed person, I think it'd really help me during these times. I am not so much looking for books on the experience of being depressed itself, but for something about living with and supporting a depressed/substance-abusive loved one.

4555,Books similar to Blake Crouch's Dark Matter and Recursion,"I LOVED these two, especially Dark Matter, so I'm looking for something similar! I really loved how they were not only a great story, but really made me think about life and exposed me to topics I knew nothing about in a very digestible way. Dark Matter is probably my favorite novel of all time.

I'm not usually into sci-fi at all (I kinda hate it actually) but these just didn't feel like sci-fi to me. I also usually read nonfiction which burns me out from time to time, so I'm looking for a novel to really get lost in. I'm considered the Wayward Pines trilogy, but I've heard a few mixed reviews and I wonder if they will lack the ""make you think about life"" and mindblowing aspect. Also, I'd hate to start a trilogy if I'm not sure about it yet.

For example, someone might say “Do androids Dream of Electric Sheep” and in response get “The Feline Plague”. What the two have in common is that in both worlds humans treat pets as a status symbol.

Adams.,"During the past years, I have been reading many different books and genres, but nothing has captivated me like the Discworld novels by the beloved and never forgotten Sir Terry (GNU). Only author that has come close is Douglas Adams.

Now that I am almost done with both (I will reread them in the future), I would love to find other authors that have produced similar comic fantasy/scifi (or just bloody funny) books to read.

I have already tried some of the usual recommendations like Wodehouse, Piers Anthony, Fforde and Sedaris, without really finding what I was looking for.

4605,Suggestions for books I can share with my neighbour,"At the beginning of the lockdown I borrowed a drill to mount a bookshelf on the wall from my neighbour, who I havent met before that. We started talking about books and I told him that I almost finished the book 'count of monte cristo' by Dumas. He asked me if he could borrow the book as soon as I finished it. So two days later I brought him the book, but he wasnt home so I put it in his mailbox. A couple of weeks later he returned the book in my mailbox, together with a note that he loved it, and a book he thought I would like (hundred years of solitude). 

Since then we have been exchanging books, even though we never see or speak each other. We just leave notes when we return the books, e.g. '9/10, I loved it' or '3/10, boring af'. The last two books he gave me were brand new, so I guess he is buying me new books to read. 

Can you suggest me some books that will make the lockdown less boring for him (and me)? (Our native language is Dutch) 

Books he/we liked:
Count of monte cristo - Dumas,
The kindly ones - Littel,
Shantaram - Roberts,

4634,Novel I can read with my boyfriend?,"Like most of you, I am stuck in the hellhole that is lockdown. My boyfriend (M29) and I (F24) have spent most of our days inside watching movies and playing videogames. As much as we enjoy that, there is only so much time one can spend behind a screen before going crazy.

Now, I had the idea to read a book together with him. We could do this before bed, and we could take turns reading chapters. It would be a fun and somewhat original 'covid-proof couple activity'.

Now my question to you lovely people is: Is there a novel that would be suitable for this? Preferably a standalone book so that it's not too big a commitment and something with pleasant pacing. I am not necessarily against bigger books but some quick reads would be nice (since it is the first time we're trying this).

&amp;#x200B;

**Some info about me**

*I am a historian and avid reader. I'm a big fantasy fan and most of the books I read fall within that genre. On top of that I'm always in the mood for a good historical novel or a very nice crime thriller (preferably with a kind of Twin Peaks vibe). I enjoy a wide variety of genres and am always in for something new. As a historian I read a lot (it's kind of my job) so I have no issues with difficult, heavy, dense or big books. That being  said,* *because* *I read so much I don't always have the stamina for very complicated or demanding books. I am always looking for a quick-paced novel that's easy to get into.*

**Some info about him**

*My boyfriend used to be an avid reader. Before he went to college he read loads of books, and it was the main reason why he didn't get enough sleep at night. Nowadays that's different: He spends so much time with his nose in stacks of papers or behind screens that he lacks the will or energy to read for fun. He is doing his PhD in Electrical Engineering so he is a busy guy. I think it has been years since he read anything (hence why I am excited to read together with him - I want to reignite his love for reading).*

*Like me, he has a love for fantasy. But unlike me, he also enjoys Sci-Fi. As a Lynch and Charlie Kauffman fan, he is very much into mindfuck stories with cool and cleaver twists. He really enjoyed the Netflix show 'Dark' and has a love for anything that involves time travel (the kind that makes sense, not the 'Back to the Future' kind).*

&amp;#x200B;

**A quick summary:**

* Fantasy is always great!
* Preferably a standalone novel
* Big books are okay but medium to small ones are safer
* Cool mysteries with cleaver plot twists will be appreciated
* Something original that handles time travel in a logical and cool way
* A book with a pleasant pacing so that it's not tedious to read it out loud",16,lqkevp,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/lqkevp/novel_i_can_read_with_my_boyfriend/

Recommended me something that will help me become less judgemental and care less about what is none of my business.

I have always despised how judgemental my mum is, she would comment on people's appearance on the street and it would bother me immensely. She  would also get upset if somebody did something differently than how she would have done it and she would continuously talk about it or try to push the person to change their decision. I recently came to the realisation I've been extremely hypocritical about this and I essentially do the same, I just channel it differently. I read through controversial comment threads on Reddit to silently judge people partaking in them, I am bothered by random decisions of my friends that have absolutely nothing to do with me and should not be bothering me.

I really dislike this about myself and would like to get rid of this bad habit and shift the mindset to be able to be more positive and supportive to the people around me.

I was OBSESSED as a young girl with The Mummy and Egypt. I realized that I don’t think I have ever read anything that involves adventures like those movies.

Maybe it’s because I’m happily married, but I’m so over reading about LOVE and YEARNING and whatever. There is more to life than finding a mate. 

But any classic, well-written book I try to find usually is about a man and his internal world. Don’t get me wrong, I love men and I love a lot of the commonly recommended books that happen to be about men (*Stoner*! *One Hundred Years of Solitude*!) but it’s harder for me to sympathize with male protagonists. 

I recently read *Lolly Willowes* by Sylvia Townsend Warner, which tells the story of a woman who escapes her kind but oppressive family to live in the English countryside, &gt;!become a witch, and commune with Satan!&lt;. I loved it because it was beautiful and tenderly written, and simply focused on the internal world of a woman. Other beautiful works I’ve found that fit this description are:
* *The Hearing Trumpet*, Leonora Carrington
* *Excellent Women*, Barbara Pym
* *Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead*, Olga Tokarczuk

She's kind of resilient to get help with her depression, that's a whole different story, but that's why I don't want to force change on her. Therefore I think a fiction book would be fitting so my MIL doesn't think I want to change her with a self help book or something.

Secondly, I should point out that I actually have a degree in Christian Ministry and am currently employed as a bivocational student minister.

4652,Low stakes mysteries like The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and the life of Walter Mitty (the movie),"I'm looking for low stakes mysteries like in those titles.    
    
Walter Mitty, for example, is just about some guy that needs a photo negative so bad that he starts tracking down the photographer, following clues and doing ""detective"" work. And that's about it. The photo isn't connected to some underground cult or it's evidence to solve a murder. It's just a photo. The mystery, of course, is just a framework in which to develop some other, more character-related and subltle things.    
    
I don't care about the daydreaming, the international adventure or the ""finding yourself"" aspects of the story - they just happen to be there, so don't bother recommending stuff that just fits that aspects of the movie. Same thing about The Dog at Night-Time, I'm not necesarilly looking for characters with mental disabilities or unreliable narrators. I just like the light mysteries. Whatever other themes are intertwined with the story are welcome!    
    
FYI, I don't actually like the Walter Mitty movie that much, but enjoyed that aspect of the movie and I think it's a pretty good example of what I mean.

4653,I just mainlined the Johannes Cabal series in a week and loved it. Help me get my next clever-fantasy-with-a-heart fix.,"First. I want to rave.  I don’t know why I haven’t discovered the Cabal series before.  I found it on a thread in this sub when looking for an audiobook to help me get through a tedious road trip.  Well, I had to put down the audiobook (even as well narrated as the first one is) and read it on the page to savor every word.  I’ve stayed up for hours and hours this week reading it.  So well crafted in language, character, and plot!  The Lovecraft dreamworld in the third book isn’t really my thing, but overall it’s the best new series I’ve found in years.  

Now, continuing on - I love books that are witty but with a heart, great world-building, and strong characters - if they happen to be funny, it’s an author that is invested in something more than just humor for humors sake.  I love an author that makes me reach for the (virtual) thesaurus without being pretentious about it.

Already been a Discworld fan for decades, especially the Watch, Death, and Tiffany Aching lines.  And have read the Golden Compass trilogy maybe a dozen times by now.

For YA, I enjoyed the Bartimaeus trilogy and Series of Unfortunate Events.

Mixed on Gaiman - love Neverwhere and The Graveyard Book.  Couldn’t get into American Gods and some of the Sandman I really like, but some are too bleak and dark for me.  The early trilogies of Robin Hobb are also a favorite reread too, though not the later ones.  

I like Douglas Adams and Jasper Fforde, but prefer a bit more of a solid story to get lost in.

In the more classic literary realm, love Wilde and Wodehouse.

I read and loved The Goblin Emperor based on a thread in this sub.  So I guess I’m not looking for a “funny” book, just “entertaining”.

I tried hard to like Sanderson - I do admire his devout world-building - but I’m always disappointed.  I guess it’s the characters and dialogue that don’t win me over.   Similarly mixed feelings about the Kingkiller Chronicles - there are some aspects of it I like, but the Mary-Sueness of Kvothe was so painful.

4658,Uplifting books suitable for those not fluent in English,"Hi r/suggestmeabook! 

This is a bit of an odd one, so bear with me. I'm hoping to start hosting refugees/asylum seekers in my spare bedroom and am trying to make the space as welcoming as possible. Of course, my mind immediately went to ""books!"" While guests will of course be welcome to peruse any of the many shelves in the house, I've heard it's common for people to keep to their room for the first few days as they adjust to living with strangers, so I wanted to include some beautiful books in there. The rub is, of course, the people passing through might not be very fluent in English, so I'm looking for books that will still be enjoyable.

I'm inclined to include **graphic novels, short story collections, poetry collections, illustrated fiction** (in the vein of And The Ocean Was Our Sky by Patrick Ness), perhaps some **children's books** (the kind you get more out of when you revisit them as an adult despite being deceptively simple would be perfect) and also some beloved shorter novels for those that are more fluent, so I'm open to suggestions for those too.

I also want books with **a hopeful tone**\- obviously some angst is totally fine, but I certainly don't want an ""everyone dies at the end,"" sort of book. **Queer** and/or **BAME** authors/poets/illustrators are a huge bonus, as a range would be great! 

Basically, if there's anything you've ever read while going through a rough patch that's been a bit of a guiding light or helped you through it at all, I'd like to hear about it, and the easier it is to parse the better.

My son is with his grandma, my newborn daughter is out with her mom while she gets together with a friend. I'm going to a new part of the city, into a bookstore I've never been, and frankly I'm elated at the prospect of the adventure.

Days like these are rare though, and I intend on savoring every minute of the afternoon. In order to maximize the day I'm looking for a fantasy read that will absolutely floor me, enrapture my imagination, and have me yearning to read the book every second that I'm not. Recently I've torn through The Fires of Vengeance by Evan Winter, and The Poppy War by Rebecca Kuang, each with absolute delight. Additionally, Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames was my favorite read of last year. I'm a very character driven reader who is also innately drawn to unique worlds and the factions at play within them.

But as big of a fantasy nerd as I am, The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton gripped me like no other book I've read so far this year. It lived in my brain every second I wasn't reading it, festering in my mind well after I reached the end. It's left me feeling like I won't find another story like it, and I've found myself craving the feeling.

4683,A book that goes really well when watching its movie after.,"Hi there.

I don't really know if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm looking for a book that will go well when watching that book's movie. What do I mean? Let me give you an example. So for whatever reason, I heard about The Hunger Games book by Suzanne Collins a few weeks back, and when I finished that book, I found out that there were two other books. Great! So I finished the series, and my friend recommend that I watch the movies. So I did, and they are so well made! Like for some reason the characters in the movies all match up somewhat similarly to what I had in my minds eye. I'm halfway through watching Catching Fire, and I'm enjoying it a lot because every time I meet a new character, I go, ""Ah, yes, that's him/her,"" and it's gets even better because I know what happens in the most action packed scenes so I can anticipate what comes next. Overall, you get the point. The Hunger Games book series and movies go well together, at least in my opinion (and many others too; I've been reading reviews).

So back to my original question: are there other books that go well with their movies? The Hunger Games movie series will probably last me a few more days (I'm binge watching rn lol sorry not sorry), so would anyone recommend any great titles/series? Again, I don't know if this belongs here but since I'm technically asking you guys to *suggest-me-a-book* ^(and also the move that goes well with it) it should be OK. So, please guys, any suggestion/recommendation would be appreciated. I'd like to thank everyone in advance, and I'll see you in the comments (if ppl even see this).

I'm assured by many that there is a surprising lack of the erotic in Les Mis considering Hugo as a person. It still counts. I'd have to say that anything by Wilde counts too.

* I'm a queer guy but I don't care about the demographics of any couples, though if you can rec a m/m book that isn't YA lit I'll love you forever (or at least for as long as my memory of the event remains)

* Please only rec it if you like it - I'm a notorious did-not-finish of books and I'd hate to DNF my celebratory 69th

* genres: I love fantasy, hate sci-fi, am relatively chill with all others except for some reason I seem to DNF more historical fiction than anything else. I don't know why.

* favourite books read this year to give you an idea of taste: NK Jemisin's Broken Earth trilogy; Red, White, &amp; Royal Blue; The Bear &amp; the Nightingale by Katherine Arden

* books I finished this year but hated: Check Please, The Infinite Noise, the first Witcher book (The Last Wish)

* books I started but absolutely will not finish: American Gods by Neil Gaiman, Conventionally Yours by Annabeth Albert, The Lost Coast by Amy Rose Capetta

4686,"A wholesome, feels good book that has little to no drama, and makes you feel warm inside","I've been in the mood for a book that will lighten up my mood. I've been struggling with depression and negative feelings lately, so whenever this happens, I like to soak up wholesome content that makes me feel warm inside. The reason I don't want a book with drama is because it tends to stress me out when I'm feeling down like this. I don't mind reading a children's book if that's what you'd like to suggest for me :) I haven't read books in a while because the drama aspects always hindered me. I tend to struggle reading books meant for people 'my age' due to them having cheating or other immoral conflicts. As I've grown to accept my sensitivity to these things, I've been wanting to sit back and relax with a good read.",62,lwmpwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/lwmpwe/a_wholesome_feels_good_book_that_has_little_to_no/
4687,"Looking for ""uncanny"" horror -- stories filled with dread, vague anxiety, and a sense of ""wrongness""","I've been relying on a few ancient posts on this subreddit to get horror book recommendations for months now. And since I've read just about everything from my set of go-to archived posts, it's time to make my own.

I'm looking for horror stories (any length) that'll get under my skin and creep me out to the point that I'm afraid to walk down the dark hallway to the bathroom at night -- something that doesn't rely solely on shock value or violence for the scare (violence is okay, btw, just doesn't hold my attention if it's the only thing going on in a story).

Specifically, I want feelings of *alienness*, *otherworldliness*, *creeping dread*, and a vague sense that something is *very wrong*. It's hard to put into words the exact thing I'm looking for, but I think that fact is actually at the heart of my search: I want something that's weird and creepy for reasons that aren't even immediately clear upon first inspection.

I'm looking for tension. I want a lot of hard-to-answer questions that bubble under the surface. Basically, I want to be a nervous wreck while I'm reading the thing.

In no particular order, here's some horror media that I feel captures the vibe:

* The Priest's Tale from ""Hyperion"" by Dan Simmons
* ""Annihilation"" by Jeff VanderMeer
* ""The Haunting of Hill House"" &amp; ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" by Shirley Jackson
* ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" by H.P. Lovecraft
* ""1408"" by Stephen King
* The visit to the parents' house in ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" by Iain Reid (not the rest of the book, unfortunately)
* ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman
* ""tarp"" by Soren Narnia (Knifepoint Horror)
* ""Get Out"" (movie) directed by Jordan Peele
* ""Silent Hill 2"" (game) by Masashi Tsuboyama",13,lwn45h,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/lwn45h/looking_for_uncanny_horror_stories_filled_with/

4697,A heartfelt thank you to this community,"Just 3 months ago I was in a dark place. Call it the pandemic blues, call it a rut, call it seasonal depression but basically I was starting to dislike myself. Trouble sleeping and I was drinking a bit every night and many nights more than a bit. I started thinking about making external changes (relationship changes) that would have been drastic when clearly the problem was internal. 

I'm not sure what the problem was but I am sure of the solution. Based on a recommendation from this community I picked up a book. I started reading for a half an hour before bed. Just a half hour. The book was key because it pulled me in and I had something I could do for me after work - a serotonin hit? I don't know but instead of cracking a beer or three, I cracked a book. Sleep has been noticeably better which got the flywheel going for many other improvements. My skin is clearer, less moody, been finding the energy to put on running shoes and get out there again. I called my father and had a long overdue conversation.

The first book that started the chain reaction was Terribilita by Shore. Then I daisy chained to Killer Angles by Shaara, then Packinko, then Remains of the Day, then a bunch of historical figure bios. 

I need to keep the peace train rolling - who has a good recommendation that grips you and doesn't let you go? Can we triangulate between ""thriller"" and ""well-written"". Remember, my mental health is at stake ;).

So growing up my relationship with my father was not the best. He did a great job providing for us, but was angry a lot because of work and was very emotionally distant overall. I was very bitter and mad about it when I was younger, but now that I'm older I understand he was just doing his best. His father was the same way from what I can gather, and it seems like there is a cycle of distant and angry fathers in my family history. Same situation with my older brother.

I want to break the cycle and be a kick ass, very emotionally available dad. I have been seeing a counselor to help me process emotions and the scars left from childhood, and one of my large fears is continuing the cycle. He suggested reading good books about this topic, so that I have something to reference other than what has been passed down through my family.

So, I am searching for books to help me accomplish this task.

I don't have kids yet, and I could have all girls, so does not need to be specifically about raising a boy even though that is what I've experienced. Looking more for being a good dad in general.

I used to be happy and positve but after this lockdown and being forced to work from home my days are long and I don't like what I've become.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want any Tony Robbins rah-rah crap or fake gurus. I don't want any books that are 300 pages long with half filled with fluff. I need something I can learn and use now.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest problem are my mornings. I almost hate waking up so I know I need to keep a positive frame of mind when I go to sleep so I wake up on the right side.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a gerbil on a wheel walking in constant circles so I need to change my morning routine but don't know how.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that only I can motivate myself but need some direction and tools to help me get there so I'm looking for a book, or maybe a workbook, that can get me going right now.",412,nzwgfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/nzwgfb/stuck_in_a_rut_need_book_to_jump_start_my_morning/

4736,Any good non-fiction books that explore the rise of the “us vs. them” mentality and why contemporary society is so divided?,"I have my own subjective opinions and biases when it comes to this (I blame the internet, basically), but I’d love to read a well-rounded, deep-dive into the subject that maybe considers other factors, such as our ancestors’ tribal behaviours, group identity, the impact of world wars, etc.

I assume most books on this topic will focus on politics, which I’d definitely be into, but I’d also be interested in reading about how it affects pop culture.

Conversely (and in the interests of not continually fuelling my own misery), if there are any good books that make a convincing argument that we’re not as divided as we think we are, I’d be up for giving those a try, too.

4780,Books That Bend Your Mind,I would love some books that totally bend your mind and force you to think deeper about what is actually happening within the story. I would prefer thriller/mystery type books.

4781,Looking for books with excellent animal companions,"I love a good animal companion. I've read a lot of animal POV books recently, but now I'm craving some human-and-animal friendships. Tell me a little about the animal companion/s when you rec, though - titles of books do very little for me to inspire me to pick a book up, and I love hearing people's opinions on characters.

I love fantasy. I can do young adult but I tend to DNF it on a much higher rate than adult fiction, so rec YA wisely. I really hate almost all sci-fi (with some bright exceptions).

Books with animal companions I've read and loved:

* His Dark Materials series with the daemons, though I feel weird calling them animal companions as they were (at least in the first series, don't ask me about the second, yikes) patently NOT simple animal companions. But I adore the concept of the animal-shaped soul lifelong companion. It soothes a lonely heart.

* Robin Hobb's Farseer books. Nighteyes &lt;3

* I really liked Mister Kindly and the other shadow animals in The Nevernight Chronicles.

* To Say Nothing About the Dog by Connie Willis. Cyril is spectacular. The dog that inspired Cyril, Montmorency from Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing About the Dog), is also a grand favourite. Bonus points for the lovely Princess Arjumand.

* All of Tamora Pierce's books with their assortment of animals won me over decades ago.

* If it's a horse book, I've probably read it. I was a horse kid for a solid five years from age 12 until I met a real horse and realised I was scared of them. Still rec it though, just in case I haven't.

Animal companion books I don't love as much:

* The Dragonriders of Pern books. I'm currently rereading them and while the dragons are great, everything else is....not.

* The Black Jewels books with their assortment of animals. Love the animals, plan to reread as soon as I grab a copy, but good lord these books. I was much too young at 12 to read them when I did.

* I really don't like anything Narnia, sadly. Nor Eragon. Obernewtyn lost me around book 5 or 6 as well, though I remember desperately racing through those books as a teenager.

* Does Naomi Novik have a dragon book? I feel like she does. Anyway, I dislike her writing, sadly, because her premises are great.",15,q1wr78,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/q1wr78/looking_for_books_with_excellent_animal_companions/
