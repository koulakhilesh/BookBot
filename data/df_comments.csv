5,7o5roz,3,"If you watch Bob’s Burgers...

If you don’t, basically Bob owns a burger joint and has a “Burger of the Day” everyday that’s usually a pun. They made an official cookbook for his burgers. It’s pretty cool, I think.

9,7o74yd,3,"If you're into fantasy, you'll most likely like Medieval History, because let me tell you, Truth is Stranger than Fiction. Most likely also, you'll be reasonably good at remembering lots of names, which leads me to... 

(1) Literally Anything Written by John Julius Norwhich. This man is a Guru of the Pen. I've personally loved both his three part [History of Byzantium](https://www.amazon.com/Byzantium-Centuries-John-Julius-Norwich/dp/0394537785) and his [History of Norman Sicily](https://www.amazon.com/Normans-South-1016-1130-Sicily/dp/0571259642/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=JANHRKBFSA4AXKTAG395). He's the fourth most British man ever to have lived (right behind Winston Churchill, Edward Gibbon, and James May, and just ahead of Rear Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell), so you'll be getting a Most Glorious Narrative in classic English prose. 

(2) This one's a bit more analytical, and on the very edge of ""Medieval,"" but it's my favorite time period in history; I'd be remiss of my duties if I didn't put in a plug for Late Antiquity. As such, Peter Heather's [The Fall of the Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Roman-Empire-History-Barbarians/dp/0195325419/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0195325419&amp;pd_rd_r=M39CV8Z6VA6XH8EGDF0E&amp;pd_rd_w=AiZP9&amp;pd_rd_wg=x8eny&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=M39CV8Z6VA6XH8EGDF0E) is absolutely brilliant. He skips about fifteen years between the Battle of Adrianople and the death of Theodosius I, but you can pick those up in the slightly more dry [Theodosius: the Empire at Bay](https://www.amazon.com/Theodosius-Empire-Imperial-Biographies-Paperback/dp/0300074476) if you're interested. For a completely different perspective on this fascinating period, check out Michael Kulikowski's new series, starting with [Triumph of Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Empire-Hadrian-Constantine-History/dp/0674659619), though I do recommend that one with the proviso that he name-drops *a lot,* with the intent of hammering it through the reader's thick skull how very inter-related the Roman aristocracy was. If you happen to like Romans, by the by, I'd also recommend Mary Beard's wonderful [History of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/SPQR-History-Ancient-Mary-Beard/dp/1631492225), though, alas, it stops right before the coolest time period ever begins. 

(3) For the high Middle Ages, I'd recommend some narrative stuff by Marc Morris, like [A Great and Terrible King](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Terrible-King-Forging-Britain/dp/1681771330/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=82FSRDQMDZG22DHXTK1P) (biography of Edward I, if you've watched Braveheart and want to know what really happened) or  [The Norman Conquest](https://www.amazon.com/Norman-Conquest-Marc-Morris/dp/0099537443). Also really interesting is Ian Mortimer's [A Time Traveler's Guide to Medieval England](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Guide-Medieval-England/dp/1439112908), which is more social history, but with quite a nice presentation. If you don't mind battering through some scholarly driveling, I'd also recommend this [biography of James IV of Scotland](https://www.amazon.com/James-IV-Norman-Macdougall/dp/0859766632), mainly because it turns out James IV was a really, really mind-bogglingly interesting person, and because Norman Macdougall has the most sarcastic footnotes ever. 

(4) And now for the round-up of things I'd like to recommend but might not fit the theme. [Peter the Great: His Life and World](https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Great-World-Modern-Library/dp/0679645608) isn't Medieval, but it reads like an epic novel, and Russian history is absolutely fascinating. If you like religion -- and, once again, don't mind a bit of scholarly dryness here or there -- Peter Brown's [Through the Eye of the Needle](https://www.amazon.com/Through-Eye-Needle-Christianity-350-550/dp/0691161771) is probably the most detailed discussion you'll find of the origins of Christian thought on wealth anywhere. If politics piques your interest and, perhaps, you've read some of the books in Number Two and like the time period, [Ruling the Later Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Ruling-Later-Empire-Revealing-Antiquity/dp/0674022440) dissects the inner workings of Late Roman government, and reveals to Us Laymen the writings of a certain John Lydus, a grumbling bureaucrat who's basically the Dilbert of the 6th century.

Anyway, I could keep prattling on, especially if you give me a time period in history you like, but I hope that covers some of the bases. "
10,7p7ov6,3,[*The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test* by Tom Wolfe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7442.The_Electric_Kool_Aid_Acid_Test) is one of my favorite books of all time and absolutely fits the bill.
