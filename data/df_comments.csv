9,7o74yd,3,"If you're into fantasy, you'll most likely like Medieval History, because let me tell you, Truth is Stranger than Fiction. Most likely also, you'll be reasonably good at remembering lots of names, which leads me to... 

(1) Literally Anything Written by John Julius Norwhich. This man is a Guru of the Pen. I've personally loved both his three part [History of Byzantium](https://www.amazon.com/Byzantium-Centuries-John-Julius-Norwich/dp/0394537785) and his [History of Norman Sicily](https://www.amazon.com/Normans-South-1016-1130-Sicily/dp/0571259642/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=JANHRKBFSA4AXKTAG395). He's the fourth most British man ever to have lived (right behind Winston Churchill, Edward Gibbon, and James May, and just ahead of Rear Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell), so you'll be getting a Most Glorious Narrative in classic English prose. 

(2) This one's a bit more analytical, and on the very edge of ""Medieval,"" but it's my favorite time period in history; I'd be remiss of my duties if I didn't put in a plug for Late Antiquity. As such, Peter Heather's [The Fall of the Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Roman-Empire-History-Barbarians/dp/0195325419/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0195325419&amp;pd_rd_r=M39CV8Z6VA6XH8EGDF0E&amp;pd_rd_w=AiZP9&amp;pd_rd_wg=x8eny&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=M39CV8Z6VA6XH8EGDF0E) is absolutely brilliant. He skips about fifteen years between the Battle of Adrianople and the death of Theodosius I, but you can pick those up in the slightly more dry [Theodosius: the Empire at Bay](https://www.amazon.com/Theodosius-Empire-Imperial-Biographies-Paperback/dp/0300074476) if you're interested. For a completely different perspective on this fascinating period, check out Michael Kulikowski's new series, starting with [Triumph of Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Empire-Hadrian-Constantine-History/dp/0674659619), though I do recommend that one with the proviso that he name-drops *a lot,* with the intent of hammering it through the reader's thick skull how very inter-related the Roman aristocracy was. If you happen to like Romans, by the by, I'd also recommend Mary Beard's wonderful [History of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/SPQR-History-Ancient-Mary-Beard/dp/1631492225), though, alas, it stops right before the coolest time period ever begins. 

(3) For the high Middle Ages, I'd recommend some narrative stuff by Marc Morris, like [A Great and Terrible King](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Terrible-King-Forging-Britain/dp/1681771330/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=82FSRDQMDZG22DHXTK1P) (biography of Edward I, if you've watched Braveheart and want to know what really happened) or  [The Norman Conquest](https://www.amazon.com/Norman-Conquest-Marc-Morris/dp/0099537443). Also really interesting is Ian Mortimer's [A Time Traveler's Guide to Medieval England](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Guide-Medieval-England/dp/1439112908), which is more social history, but with quite a nice presentation. If you don't mind battering through some scholarly driveling, I'd also recommend this [biography of James IV of Scotland](https://www.amazon.com/James-IV-Norman-Macdougall/dp/0859766632), mainly because it turns out James IV was a really, really mind-bogglingly interesting person, and because Norman Macdougall has the most sarcastic footnotes ever. 

(4) And now for the round-up of things I'd like to recommend but might not fit the theme. [Peter the Great: His Life and World](https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Great-World-Modern-Library/dp/0679645608) isn't Medieval, but it reads like an epic novel, and Russian history is absolutely fascinating. If you like religion -- and, once again, don't mind a bit of scholarly dryness here or there -- Peter Brown's [Through the Eye of the Needle](https://www.amazon.com/Through-Eye-Needle-Christianity-350-550/dp/0691161771) is probably the most detailed discussion you'll find of the origins of Christian thought on wealth anywhere. If politics piques your interest and, perhaps, you've read some of the books in Number Two and like the time period, [Ruling the Later Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Ruling-Later-Empire-Revealing-Antiquity/dp/0674022440) dissects the inner workings of Late Roman government, and reveals to Us Laymen the writings of a certain John Lydus, a grumbling bureaucrat who's basically the Dilbert of the 6th century.

Anyway, I could keep prattling on, especially if you give me a time period in history you like, but I hope that covers some of the bases. "
10,7p7ov6,3,[*The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test* by Tom Wolfe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7442.The_Electric_Kool_Aid_Acid_Test) is one of my favorite books of all time and absolutely fits the bill.

I work at a university and the library there removes dust jackets so there was not even any cover art or blurb to tell me anything. Was it a comedy?  A romance?  A historical novel?  No idea!

He uses magic and interacts with supernatural creatures to do so. I don't recall much foul language, and there really isn't much sex... though that's mostly because Harry is rubbish with women. The first book is *Storm Front*. They are all stand-alone novels in the sense that each mystery is solved within the book, but as the series progesses, a book-to-book plot line is gradually revealed."

38,7pfp0p,3,One that really helped me was the alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

45,7py7b0,3,"The Road by Cormac McCarthy 

Also the World War Z book is way better and very different from the movie. In the book it's a lot of shorter stories around the world as the zombie apocalypse is happening. "
46,7py7b0,3,"The world war z audiobook is absolutely phenomenal and bares almost no relation to the movie.  The print version is also great, but the voiceacting in the audio version is probably just about the best possible... really something everyone should get to experience."
47,7pzwu4,3,Have you read *S.* by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst?
48,7qmnds,3,Definitely *A Little Life* . 
49,7qmnds,4,"The Flowers in the Attic series. There 4 books about the Dollanganger family, and each one gets more and more fucked up. Lots of incest, but also murder, rape, torture, and just lots of wild drama. 
The second book, Petals on the Wind is my favorite. 
And if you’ve seen the 80s movie for Flowers in the Attic (or the lifetime remake from a few years ago), don’t judge the books by that because those movies are garbage. I think they maybe made a movie of Petals on the Wind too, but I didn’t see it so I can’t speak for its quality. "
50,7r2gh9,3,"I'd recommend [*The Girl in the Road*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_in_the_Road) by Monica Byrne. It's a speculative fiction piece about a world where geopolitical power has shifted to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. There's a solar-panel bridge that spans the Arabian Sea that's used as an illegal smuggling path for migrants going from India to Africa. The book follows two protagonists as they deal with migration, displacement, etc. I won't give too much more away so as to not spoil the book, but it's a really fantastic read. When they released the paperback, they gave it a more [YA](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514TfwokSIL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg) look than the [hardcover version](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1379897131l/18297954.jpg), which is a shame, but don't let that discourage you.

For something a bit more grounded in reality, try [*Green Girl*](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062322838/green-girl) by Kate Zambreno. It's a Roman à clef about working as a shopgirl in London and generally fucking up and growing up. Had a similar cover fiasco to the book above, unfortunately."
51,7r35h6,3,I would definitely read it but make sure you have enough time to do some heavy binging. I read it last summer but kept getting confused because the plot line was a bit jumpy and I was only able to read it in little bits at a time. 
52,7rc45o,3,"Yes. There are three levels of narration. The first layer is the story of Johnny Truant, a young guy who finds a box in the house of a blind man who just died. Inside the box are hundreds of papers and he describes to the audience how he figures out how they belong together. It turns out that the content of those papers is some kind of scientific paper written by the blind man, which is the second level of the story. The object of the scientific research is a very strange, homemade  film, called the ""Navidson Record"". The NR is the third level of the story and inside the NR we see how a man, Will Navidson, moves in a new house with his wife and children. One day, he makes an unbelievable discovery: Inside the house, from one day to the next, a mysterious door appears. It leads into an endless system of dark corridors. This is where the horror starts.

And the form of the text - the spirals of text, the black pages, the labyrinthic layout - mirrors what is happening in the story. Also, all three layers are connected.

It's rather challenging to read, because the storylines alternate again and again, so you are continuously interrupted. For the first read I suggest to completely ignore Level 1 and 2 und just read the complete Navidson Record in one session.
"
53,7rdo8k,3,"Some of my favorites:

- *Harrison Bergeron* by Kurt Vonnegut

- *The Necklace* by Guy de Maupassant 

- *The Lottery* by Shirley Jackson"
54,7ud3g0,3,"Although admittedly not quite a story, Man’s search for meaning by Victor Frankl left me with an epiphany today. Do consider it"
55,7udrw0,3,"If you like zombie movies, maybe World War Z (the book is very different from the movie, and I would say much better). For general sci-fi, The Martian is a pretty common suggestion, or Ready Player One. Old Man's War is another, or Redshirts. For Star Wars, the Thrawn Trilogy is very good, or Shadows of the Empire. 

In general, you might start with books that you've seen the movie version of, since you wouldn't be going in totally blind and you'd have a good idea of whether you like the plot. It may depend on why you haven't read much though (did you find the books you tried boring? or confusing? or if you have something like dyslexia or ADD maybe it was just hard to read or sit in one place for very long).

97,7zskgj,9,The serial killer whisperer. That book (with real letters from real serial killers) had me intensely creeped out. Almost every chapter had something crazy-fucked up in it. Great book tho 
98,7zskgj,9,I see where you’re coming from. The intense description of his apartment for example where makes and models and brands are all meticulously described! It does create a hugely unnerving personality 
99,7zskgj,5,"this was my recommendation to, it’s one of my favorites. i really love the character development in this one. i also recommend Lullaby for fucked uppery "
100,7zskgj,50,"Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy

104,7zskgj,27,This book is SO disturbing and good 
105,7zskgj,4,"TL;DR Chuck Palahniuk.  Snuff has been sitting on my shelf for some time now.  Might need to read it soon.

I've read the rest of the CP recommendations - he's extremely vivid and extraordinarily well-researched, which is a good recipe for fucked up."
106,7zskgj,4,"Great book. I read it a couple of years ago, damn it’s fucked up"
107,7zskgj,4,"What I love is that CP tried to get it published but no publisher would touch it because of how messed up it was. So he challenged himself to write something even more fucked.

113,7zskgj,4,"Yeah I really can’t put my finger on why I liked it so much. I read it around 6 or 7 years ago and just remember flying through it. Maybe because I ended up approaching it almost like a horror novel, rather than literary fiction? Idk "
114,7zskgj,5,"When the piano stops by Catherine McCall. Doctor father rapes her for years, drunk mother watches and does nothing, she gets pregnant by her father, father does the abortion. All a true story. All so fucked up. "
115,7zskgj,10,"Omg, yes! How didn't that occur to me. I am a mother and my kids are not as remotely messed up as Kevin but it's scary to think as a mother you're just supposed to love and try to raise a child as best you can. In the end no matter how hard you try if your child does something horrible everyone, including you, is wondering how the mother messed them up "
116,7zskgj,7,"It feels like a commentary on how terrible people can be to each other and how they can justify mistreatment of people with less power then them. How easily people can take happiness from each other because of their beliefs or sense of justice. Very unforgettable, but bold and in some ways amazing. "

121,7zskgj,3,"Ruby by Bond. Child rape, ghost rape, regular rape--it has something for everyone!"

124,7zskgj,15,"The last book in the Dark Tower Series. It's only fucked up if you read the entire series. That's the only way it truly has poignancy. 

Kindred. It's about a black woman who ends up travelling back to slavery days. You can imagine what happens. 

I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream . It's a short story. Worth a quick read. 

People of the Lie, which is actually a book about sociopaths. It's fucked up because I recognized so many people in my life in that book."
125,7zskgj,3,"I started (and dnf’d) 120 Days of Sodom (Marquis de Sade)which I knew was going to be awful but I could hardly get past the introduction to the characters - such vile people with no hygiene or morals. It has murder, rape, paedophilic, incest, scat, orgies, torture... 
I said I’d give it a go due to its fame but it was so fucked up that I had to give up. 

I’m currently working my way through The Road Out of Hell, which is about Sanford Clark and the Wineville murders. 
Poor kid taken to the US from an abusive home in Canada by a terrifying uncle who proceeds to beat and abuse him, and who makes the lad help in the rape, torture and murder of other boys at their secluded chicken farm. 
It’s heart wrenching to see how terrified he is so I’m only able to read it bits at a time. "
126,7zskgj,20,"I remember reading that book and completely questioning my own decency. Like... it sucked me in so much I couldn’t put it down, but in hindsight I couldn’t help but think “what kind of person am I that I stayed up all night to finish this story?” It really was the epitome of disturbing. "
127,7zskgj,4,And the way at the start of the book you feel like you're reading a standard novel about a yuppie guy and then you get flashes of unexpected violence.

133,7zskgj,6,Yes
134,7zskgj,6,Yes
135,7zskgj,6,Which is interesting because I don't find Fight Club as fucked up as Lullaby or even something like Haunted. Like I know that Lullaby and Haunted would never in a million years be able to be tamed down enough to convey the story and still pass rating standards for a motion picture. 
136,7zskgj,10,"Came here to recommend this! If you liked it, she has another book that came out last year that follows the same two detectives. It's called The Roses of May."
137,7zskgj,3,Yep.

I know people say Last Exit to Brooklyn is better (more fucked up) but that was the first Selby book I read and going inside the mind of his Inmate character and the scenarios he dreamed up almost had me putting the book down in several passages. "
145,7zskgj,19,"""Rant"" (another Palanhiuk novel) is equally bonkers.

You start with a solid foundation: a redneck who likes to crash cars and has some really weird superpowers. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, of course. Venturing deeper into the rabbit hole, there's some rape, incest, and boogers stuck to walls, all of which have been facilitated by time travel. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Palanhiuk's writing style, but I'll be damned if he can't put together a solid storyboard."
146,7zskgj,4,Don't forget about *The Road*.
147,7zskgj,4,"Honestly, there's a lot of disturbing stuff found in the catalogues of Palanhiuk and McCarthy, as have been mentioned earlier in the thread, but I think the most fucked up book I've read has to be Demons by Dostoevsky. The way that Dostoevsky manages to get under the skin of every character and make the reader feel as if the insecurities and neuroses of the characters are their own is so unsettling, so difficult to read, but absolutely intriguing. It's definitely one of the more overlooked Dostoevsky novels, but barring The Idiot I think that it honestly contends with if not surpasses any of his other works."
148,7zskgj,3,The End of Alice by Homes. I hated that book! (About a pedophile)
149,7zskgj,4,"God, the scene in The Wasp Factory with the babies in the hospital?? I think about that all the time, it just pops into my head unbidden - it’s awful!"
150,7zskgj,3,Disturbing is how it’s slowly turning into non-fiction.
151,7zskgj,4,"We had to dissect Choke in my Contemporary Lit class. It has been a year and I still can’t wash it off. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed it but diving that deep into some of the situations in that book got a little weird and slightly disturbing. "
152,7zskgj,4,**The People in the Trees** by Hanya Yanagihara. Very well-written book about horrible things.
153,7zskgj,12,"Eh. I honestly think Brave New World is more non-fiction than 1984. I think the desire to be safe, settled, and secure outweighs the desire to express personal freedoms/virtues and I think Huxley did a really good job of that.

156,7zskgj,4,"Fiesta a oscuras, the first time I read a few pages threw the book away. Eventually finished it. It's in spanish, tho, and had  a very limited run on the seventies.

Mosquito coast, by paul theroux was pretty fucked up back when I read it.

The People in the Trees is a good contender, finished it and after a whoah just stared at a wall for a while.

Flashback, by Dan Simmons. Politically charged tract by a very talented author, the worst from one of the best.

Gargantua and pantagruel have it's own category of fucked up, but pretty innocent at the same time

Of course  Justine and Juliette, by the Marquis de Sade. Some friends somehow got convinced his moral was ok, so, beware, it could be a cognitohazard for some."
157,7zskgj,4,"I'm trying to make my way through it but it's difficult, I second this suggestion

160,7zskgj,3,The Wasp Factory is the most disturbing book I’ve ever read. It created some horrible imagery for me that’s never far from my thoughts.  It’s so bleak.
161,7zskgj,3,"I second Kindred, though wouldn't call it fucked-up. Octavia Butler (author) didn't make it awful for the protagonist as a black woman cast back into times of slavery--she had the advantage of being ""from the future."" A fascinating, authentic read."
162,7zskgj,4,I really enjoyed The Collector. I didn’t enjoy the sickening feeling I had every time I realised I was feeling sorry for him.

171,7zskgj,3,"I read it in high school and thought, ""Yeah, creepy, what if the government was always watching you?""

191,7zwc0t,8,"*Guns, Germs and Steel*

I also recommend reading Clifford Geertz. I read many pieces he’s written during my anthropology courses. *The Interpretation of Cultures * Might be a good place to start with his work."
192,7zwc0t,7,The spirit catches you and you fall down by fadiman. The ghost map. Great books and works of medical anthropology 
193,7zwc0t,8,"Cultural Anthropology, by Conrad Phillip Kottak .

It has very basics concepts, I think it's a good introduction to anthropology. "
194,7zwc0t,5,As anthropology can be pushed into so many directions it would help if you shared an area of interest... a particular place in the world? Environmental issues? Economics? Religion? Would love to help you find an ethnography that fits ur interests. 
195,7zwc0t,6,"I just got my bachelors in Anthropology last summer, so I'm a bit biased when I say go for it lol. Most of what I own are from required readings that were just so interesting that I had to keep them. So here are a couple books I've enjoyed:


The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot - Written by a journalist so super easy to read and gives a good insight on how racism and classism determined treatment in early-near modern American hospitals and discusses the controversies over human tissue ownership.

Portraits of ""The Whiteman"" by Keith Basso - A linguist book on how interactions with ""the whiteman"" influenced how humor and story telling changed among the Western Apache people, specifically the differences between children and adults. Super easy to read and has some funny anecdotal bits from the author during his time out in the field. 

Pretty much anything by Ruth Benedict. You'll read a lot about her since she's such a prominent figure in Anthropology. I still have a copy of her Patterns of Culture that I go through every now and then. With your political background I think you'd enjoy The Chrysthanemum and the Sword. It's caused a lot of discussions on the ethics of using anthropological research for political and military advantage. 

For newer books I've enjoyed The Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve by Stephen Greenblatt and Origins of Creativity by Edward O. Wilson. I'm super into comparative religions and how stories have influenced human history so if that's not your thing idk if you'll find those interesting or boring. 
"
196,7zwc0t,4,"Violence and the Sacred by René Girard might be an interesting pick depending on your taste. Strictly speaking, it is an anthropological text, though the research done by Girard is almost wntirely theoretical, and influenced by philosophy, psychology, and classics. Girard writes clearly and concisely, making it very easy to follow his arguments without the text feeling at all dry or tedious. Overall, it's a fresh take on the role that violence (specifically religious violence) plays in society, though if you read it you should keep in mind that the research doesn't have the most solid of foundations."
197,7zwc0t,3,"The Gebusi: Lives Transformed in a Rainforest World, Fourth Edition, by Bruce Knauft. This is a case study rather than a generalized anthro text but this is the one that solidified that I was in the right field. "
198,7zwc0t,3,"The Wayfinders by Wade Davis. This particular collection of CBC Massey Lectures is focused on the introduction to and study of cultural anthropology through Wade Davis' own work in the field, expressed in narrative form. He also has other works that are written in a similar storytelling style, which I find both captivating and informative."
199,7zwc0t,3,"Not ""Guns, Germs and Steel"": It's very popular in the mainstream, but in the academic world [the reviews are quite negative.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel#Academic_reviews)

[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1491:_New_Revelations_of_the_Americas_Before_Columbus) by Charles C. Mann is both fairly popular and well reviewed if you are interested in the Americas."

While Cognitive Behaviour Therapy or even hypnosis can give you effective strategies for lessening or cutting out Impulsive behaviour, you’d probably be best served by an individual diagnosis of your overall mental health, to root out what is causing the distress you are band-aiding with spending and eating.   In short, the over-spending and over-eating are a symptom, not a cause.  Tackling your cause will probably be more effective than tackling your symptoms alone."

247,856k61,3,Simon Winchester writes very similarly to Erik Larson. A Crack in the Edge of the World is about the earthquake and subsequent fires that ravaged San Francisco.
248,856k61,3,I find myself wanting to send him suggestions. Every time I about an interesting time period or occurrence I want to read Erik Larson’s take on it. 
249,856k61,3,The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova was a fun read for me after having read several of dan brown's books. Engrossing travels through several countries and revovles around the history and myths of Vlad the Impaler. I also enjoyed the shadowed footsteps of the MC's father by way of his journals. 
250,85785n,7,"There is a comic ""my lesbian experience with loneliness""

Although the authors sexuality is as a lesbian it really delves into delayed adulthood and such themes. 

I'd suggest giving it a go if you're up for a manga style graphic novel.

I don't have a title for you, but I felt like I needed to clarify this in case you ask anyone this question. The difference is very, very important, and, sadly, I think your title is why you were voted down. People thought (I assume) that you meant something else.

265,90pfpm,5,"Lovecraft is an icon of weird fiction, and his works are often thought to exemplify the genre. You should look into it; some other famous authors include China Mieville, K.J. Bishop, Jeff VanderMeer, Kathe Koja, Karin Tidbeck, Edgar Allen Poe, Algernon Blackwood, and many others. In fact, the anthology *The Weird* acts as a sort of weird fiction timeline that you might check out. "

269,90q39y,13,Pick up the Necronomicon and start from the beginning.
270,90q39y,12,"""At the Mountains of Madness"" is one of my favorites."
271,90q39y,6,"Same, I started with call of cuthulu but kept reading after the mountains of madness. The shadow over innsmouth was really great too."
272,90q39y,8,"Dagon is often considered a great starting place. Short, has lots of Lovecraftiness, part of his mythos. 

If you end up enjoing that, move on to The Shadow Over Innsomuth, The Rats in the Walls, The Call of Cthuhlu, At the Mountains of Madness, The Dunwich Horror, Pickman's model. From Beyond and Re-Animator are personal favourites. 

I believe all of his works can be found online. Lovecraft has some great works, but he also has some great lows. The language and style can be a bit of a boundary sometimes, but if you persist with it, Lovecraft can be very rewarding. "
273,90q39y,10,"Maybe try The Shadow Over Innsmouth, definitely one of his more suspenseful, action-packed stories. It will keep you interested, while also getting you used to his style of writing. Enjoy! "
274,90q39y,6,The Colour Out of Space is a short sweet appetizer that prepares you for the rest of his works. Imo start with that
275,90q39y,5,"You'll probably get as many answers as there are Lovecraft fans. I'd guess your best bet would be to grab one of the short story collections, preferably one that includes Call of the Cthulhu, The Shadow Over Innsmouth and The Colour Out of Space,
or if you prefer longer stories then go for At the Mountains of Madness.
 "
276,90q39y,4,"So, it depends how you want to do it.  Most of Lovecraft's best work falls into what's known as the Cthulhu mythos, these are stories that all sort of build on one another and/or explicitly exist in the same universe/within the context of one another.  


Option 1, if you want to dive right in the Cthulhu mythos, I would say start with the story Call of Cthulhu, follow it up by either reading Dagon (which is short) and following Dagon with The Shadow over Innsmouth (or skip Dagon) and/or The Whisperer in Darkness.  Those big three, 1-Call of Cthulhu, 2-Shadow Over Innsmouth and 3-The Whisperer in Darkness are three essential heavyweights of the Cthulhu mythos and are also more or less universally regarded as three of his best-written stories.  Once you've read those three, and if you think you're ready for it, then read At The Mountains of Madness.  If I were starting over and had never read Lovecraft before, that's how I would recommend doing it.  

The other option, self-contained stories that don't necessarily exist within the context of the mythos.  The best of these stories, in my opinion, is The Colour Out of Space, it's great for Halloween etc and will give you an accurate feel for Lovecraft's writing.  

Either way you tackle it, you'll never be the same once you've read them.  Hope you enjoy, and welcome to the madness"

The two main characters, who grow up together on an outer-rim world, eventually find themselves on opposing sides of the Galactic Civil War.  It is tagged as a YA novel, as it includes some coming of age elements to the story, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone as it's a great story for all ages."

Poison by Chris Wooding; story about a girl who has to rescue her sister, who was kidnapped. I am bad at describing things but it's a very interesting book.

Around the world in 80 days; if you haven't already, this too is a great unexpected adventure. Not similar to The Hobbit but unexpected adventure.

Gulliver's Travels but Jonathan Swift; if you haven't already, not unexpected journeys but unexpected places.

Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson; (bad at descriptions, ugh) but there are pirates and a treasure.

The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; a book about exploration mainly, in a sense, they expected the journey and what it entails (kinda?), it's an interesting read. This is the only book in the Professor Challenger series that I have read so, I can't say about the other books in the series."
336,90sbfe,3,"""Beyonders"" by Brandon mull its a fun YA fantasy adventure. A little bit cliche but definitely one of my favorite of these types of books."

346,90ubrh,3,Wasnt able to finish this book. Its kinda scary sad.
347,90ubrh,13,Remains of the Day is different but I honestly thought it was even better. 
348,90ubrh,3,I want to read it so badly now!! Does it have the same kind of emotional experience?

350,90ubrh,4,"Any other Ishiguro’s! I’d recommend The Buried Giant, apart from The Remains of the Day. "
351,90ubrh,6,"Yes. Without saying too much, the narrator is pretty unreliable and the growing contradictions between the narrative he presents and the reality lead to some pretty emotional moments. "
352,90ubrh,9,"Yes! If it’s interpersonal relationships you’re looking for, Remains of the Day is the perfect choice. It’s such a hard book to recommend as the plot isn’t exactly attention grabbing, but it’s heart-wrenching, and being an Ishiguro book the story is just told so well. "

358,90ubrh,3,Hah. My bookclub absolutely hated it. 
359,90ubrh,4,"yeah, great book.  i wasn't as keen on *when we were orphans* though.  his other novels don't have sci-fi, that i know of (haven't read them all).

literary scifi is really rare, unfortunately, and probably depends on the reader's taste to some extent.  i recently read vandermeer's *borne* and was impressed, but it's set in an future dystopia so not at all subtle.  margaret atwood is another possibility.  but maybe your best bet is david mitchell - he's a good writer that sometimes has sci-fi or fantasy elements in otherwise normal (well) novels.  [see](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/10/david-mitchell-and-literary-and-genre-fiction-world-fantasy-award) (which, incidentally, mentions ishiguro's *buried giant*)."

362,90ubrh,3,I read the short story in 8th grade and loved it! Never read the novel. I’ll look into it - thank you!

Have you seen The Lobster? this reminds me of that novel. "
364,90wcji,3,"Not sure if you’re M or F, some of these may have been enjoyable to me as a female. That said:

Kitchen Confidential by Bourdain

Hillbilly Elegy

Glass Castle and broken horses? Jeanette walls Can’t remember the sequel name but both were amazing, may be more affective for a woman

Anything written by David Sedaris 

Kurt Vonnegut’s essay collection, can’t remember title but google will help  ( I laughed out loud and it may be a great intro to his fiction) 

Boy and flying solo by Roald Dahl (meant for YA) his adult short stories are as amazing has his kid fiction tho. 

Oral history of daily show, oral history of punk, oral history of porn (can’t remember titles but fantastic reads) 

Anything by Studs Turkle. My fave is the American dream lost and found. 

Enjoy! I miss reading as much as I used to! Also look into long form periodicals for any interest you have. I can read the Sunday NYT all week and learn new things but any mag you’re interested would prob be worth a subscription. Usually way cheap. 
"
365,90y1vo,11,"It's been awhile since I've read it, but I think it alternates between focusing on the story and the philosophy.  IMO it's all woven together pretty well and very easy to read though.  If you're interested in it you should just dive in and see what you think."
366,90y1vo,3,"trust me, I've read that book many many times. Don't worry to understand all the Greek philosophy part; just read it and follow the flow, then reading after reading things will emerge. If you begin with fear it is going to suck, too much stress. If you relax and pick up jsut the things you like it is going to be fun.  
First time I did understand the 40% of what was there, but I've liked the approach, the voice. This gave me the desire to read it for a second time and then a third, a fourth. Until I've decided to deconstruct the whole thing"
367,90y1vo,10,"It's not that it's too heavy on the philosophy, it's that Pirsig's philosophy is absolute and total bullshit."

While I doubt I'll pick it up adhesion anytime soon i am curious about someone who is reading it more for fun than i had to. "
372,90y3fp,6,"The Ruins by Scott Smith seems to fit the bill. Here's the summary:

The Ruins follows two American couples, just out of college, enjoying a pleasant, lazy beach holiday together in Mexico as, on an impulse, they go off with newfound friends in search of one of their group—the young German, who, in pursuit of a girl, has headed for the remote Mayan ruins, site of a fabled archeological dig. This is what happens from the moment the searchers—moving into the wild interior—begin to suspect that there is an insidious, horrific “other” among them . . ."

378,90z81i,8,*Ghettoside* by Jill Leovy did a nice job of showing how both liberals and conservatives are wrong when it comes to “black on black” crime and did it through both narratives and research. I found it eye-opening.
379,90z81i,6,**Confederates in the Attic** by *Tony Horwitz* is an enlightening and entertaining read about how the American Civil War still reverberates in American culture. It is an honest look at the romanticism and veneration of a culture which enslaved and tore the US apart. I believe it especially holds meaning in light of the current political situation in America.
380,90z81i,22,"Columbine, by Dave Cullen.  Cullen was assigned to cover the shooting almost immediately and this book is the result of years of research being close to the tragedy.  There was so much stuff I thought I knew about the shootings, the shooters, and the aftermath that was wrong.  The Trenchcoat Mafia (it existed but neither killer was a member)  the killers obsession with Marylin Manson (they weren't) , the killers as bullied outcasts (they were fairly popular and well-liked)  and a bunch more things I was wrong about.  The author gives super-detailed psychological profiles of the killers, which is really fascinating.

It also goes into great detail about the response by the police and SWAT team, and goes into some coverups orchestrated by the police (but doesn't speculate or go conspiracy theory-heavy.  Just like, ""Here's what the police said happened, but these later documents show that was not the case."")

All in all, a great book.  I can't recommend it enough."

385,90zgvd,4,"I'm just a clueless man but I love the Women characters in *Great Expectations*. Most of them I would consider strong characters that fill traditional roles; sweetheart, housewife, mother, dowager, but all flawed in ways that make them more interesting and more real  than flat stereotypes. And, despite the wild coincidences in the plot in final chapters, the characters never feel contrived. *Caveat* - This is all just my personal take on the book.

396,90zgvd,4,"Basically anything by Jane Austen. 

Little Women.

Anne of Green Gables. 

Princess Bride by William Goldman.

Uprooted by Naomi Novik. 

This is a kids series, but I loved the Enchanted Forest Chronicle's. The main character is definitely not a traditional 'princess' in the fairy tale sense of the term (as is argued many times in the books), but she is still very feminine. "
397,90zgvd,4,"I don’t know what you consider traditionally feminine, but Claire in the Outlander series is extremely nurturing, and is very much the “gatherer” side of “Hunter/gatherer.” She always wears dresses due to the time period, but does things to make them more practical. I like that she accepts traditional gender roles from the past (from her point if view; she’s a time traveler, if you’re not familiar) when the stakes are low. But when they’re high, like getting beaten by one’s husband or raped by powerful men, she does not accept that at all, and fights viciously."

408,bo4fmw,5,"When I get depressed I read a lot of romance. Fun characters, easy reads, no consequence and they always have a happy ending."
409,bo4fmw,3,"When I'm not feeling my best, any book or genre that i have a sort of 'muscle memory' of (i.e i've read it before or it has prevaling themes which are typical of that genre) are great for me - i don't have to work too hard and it's like meeting an old friend. humour or pure escapism like fantasy are immensely calming for me, and fantasy sagas have the bonus of often being realllllyyyyy long so I don't get anxious about it being over and being catapaulted back to reality again.."
410,bo4fmw,3,"For me it's just the good old escape.

I usually take about one to two weeks to finish a book, but sometimes, when I'm having my really low moments, it can take up to one month or even more (the current book I'm reading has already reached the one month mark and I've read only half of it).

Nonetheless, I try to read at least a little every single day. I tend to get really depressed when I'm alone with my thoughts, so reading is a really effective way I found to keep my mind busy with something else.

When it comes to the literary genre, I don't have a favourite one. I will read basically anything (fantasy, sci-fi, non-fiction, etc.)."
411,bo4fmw,3,"Clown comment, bro."
412,bo4fmw,3,YES. Same!
413,bo4fmw,4,"When I'm depressed, I don't read at all. Watch a lot of tv instead because I need stimuli. Then, as the fog clears, I usually try to reintroduce myself to reading by hanging out with some old friends, aka, books I've read inside out and love so that reading becomes a habit. Most often books from my childhood, Jane Austen, etc. As long as I stick at it, muscle memory will kick in and I'm reading again."
414,bo4fmw,4,"Oh and if you want titles. Anything by Sarah Maclean is fun, Dead until Dark by Charlene Harris is Great.

If you’re looking for some fun fantasy with less romance I am absolutely in love with A Darker Shade of Magic by Schwab, and Spinning Silver by Novak....

I hope you feel better soon!"
415,bo4fmw,3,"Omg. It. Me.

I read (and thoroughly loved) Jeffrey Eugenides’ The Virgin Suicides through a _seemingly_ quiet period, and JEHEEZUS, the spin-cycle that gobsmacked me after.

Interesting that you can read nonfiction at the time. I retain ZERO new information when I blues-read."

*The Poisonwood Bible* - a Georgia family travels to the Congo on a mission trip directly after independence (1960s) and finds family tensions and insurmountable cross-cultural differences in their new home. Told from the persepectives of the women in the family"
418,bo9o8q,11,"For some classic sci fi, Ray Bradbury is a really good go-to - I’d particularly recommend I Sing the Body Electric. If you also like some more horror/thriller sci-fi, Hitchcock’s Stories That Scared Even Me. It’s a massive anthology with several volumes and many different authors, so you don’t get bored with the style or tropes.

I also find when mental health wrecks my focus, listening to audiobooks can be a useful change of pace.

Best of luck, and I hope your mental health returns soon!"
419,bo9o8q,3,Ray Bradbury is incredible so I definitely second this recommendation. His writing is so striking and beautiful. My favourite of his is the Illustrated Man.
420,bo9o8q,5,I was going to suggest Ray Bradbury as well. I enjoy the October Country.
421,bo9o8q,3,"Strange Weather by Joe Hill 

The Bazaar of Bad Dreams by Stephen King"
422,bo9o8q,14,Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman. The book is split up into different stories from Norse Mythology. It would be an easy one to put down and pick back up quickly.
423,bo9o8q,5,Her Body and Other Parties!
424,bo9o8q,3,"I just read Beware of God by Shalom Auslander under similar circumstances and found it engaging.  

Simon Rich’s books are also a light, entertaining read."
425,bo9o8q,3,"Borges Collected Fictions. You can get every short story he ever wrote in translation for about $16. Particular favorites are, The Immortal, The Secret Miracle, The Aleph, and the library of Babel."
426,bo9o8q,9,“Welcome to the Monkey House” is a great collection of some of Vonnegut’s best short stories!
427,bo9o8q,5,"It’s not fantasy, but my go-to reading when I’m blue is David Sedaris. His stories are engaging and clever, and there’s a snide edge to them that really speaks to me when I’m in the dumps. The fact that they invariably make me laugh is just a bonus."
428,bo9o8q,10,"David Sedaris. Not fiction, but he tells a great story. Plus he’s hilarious. He might lighten the mood."
429,bo9o8q,3,Angry Candy by Harlan Ellison
430,bo9o8q,6,Unexpected Magic by Diana Wynne Jones. It's a collection of lighthearted fantasy shorts from the same author that wrote Howl's Moving Castle.
431,bo9o8q,3,"The Little Prince is not only a quick read, but a rather uplifting one."
432,bo9o8q,3,"Tenth of December by George Saunders, not really fantasy oriented but he has a few magical realism ones in there. 

Also, Smoke &amp; Mirrors by Neil Gaiman. Wide array of short stories, some of them *are* fantasy based"
433,bo9o8q,3,Hemingway short stories are a good option! His way of communication complex emotions in the most direct way is amazing
434,bo9o8q,3,I run into the same problem. Thanks for the idea of short stories instead. Sorry I don’t have any suggestions for you.
435,bo9o8q,3,"You know what I think will hit the spot. Neverwhere, The graveyard book or The ocean at the end of the lane all by Neil Gaiman. He writes in a poetic, modern fairy tale style. The books really make you feel happy and fulfilled. They are also perfect to read in bed on a rainy day"
436,bo9o8q,6,"You might try listening to LeVar Burton reads (podcast). He reads short stories and his voice is so calming - it feels like he cares. For me, it takes less energy to put on a podcast when I'm depressed."
437,bo9o8q,8,Also his collection Smoke and Mirrors has great stories
438,bo9o8q,4,"Wonderful collection with a mix of genres.  Sci-fi is well represented by Harrison Bergeron and the title story, which is a twisted dystopian satire.  For my money the best short story collection since Jack London.  Most of them are upbeat, which might be a plus if you’re going through times."
439,bo9o8q,4,"""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is really funny, very self-deprecating, and humorously written, a good way to lighten the mood."
440,bo9o8q,3,"I always recommend ""Hyperbole and a Half"" by Allie Brosh.   It's a graphic novel, so an easy read, and her sections about her dogs are really touching and hilarious, but she also represents depression in just about the most accurate, funny way I've ever seen, and it really does make you feel better just to see it."
441,bo9o8q,3,"Agreed, When You Are Engulfed In Flames had me laughing literally out loud."
442,bo9o8q,3,"I really recommend you try anthology collections, featuring multiple authors. I listened to an amazing audiobook short story fantasy(ish) collection called *Rogues*, with stories from everybody from GRRM to Gillian Flynn, fresh narrator and fresh style to every story.

Plus it's like a sampler pack, so theres always a chance you'll find a new author with a whole catalogue to explore. I listened to another really cool anthology last year, a Halloween-ey horror one called *Haunted Nights* (ed Datlow iirc). 

I would also second recommendations for Neil Gaiman and Steven King short story collections."

444,buxcpv,3,I’d recommend The Belgariad Series by David Eddings.
445,bzusmp,4,"u/wjbc I think has given the best advice here for how to approach the rest of the series. I thoroughly enjoined the full series but I do understand it is not for everyone.

I found myself more intrigued with the Ender's Shadow series which I felt was more in line with Ender's Game than Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, or Children of the Mind.

Unfortunately, a major down side to the Shadow series is that Card has yet to write the final book which (spoiler) &gt;!is set to come full circle with Bean's genius children meeting up with Ender's reborn brother and sister from Children of the Mind. !&lt;"
446,bzvgjo,3,"When I first read *Wuthering Heights* in high school, I absolutely hated it. Then I read it again in university and thought it was actually pretty alright. I wrote two papers on it that year and so ended up reading it through three or four times, and every time I did I found something new to appreciate. It's a good book!"
447,ck4etr,4,Thank you. There’s nothing that can be quite so kind as the love for a good book and the love of a good mother.

449,cxqby7,4,"I couldn’t get through her Tommy and Tuppence series. It lacked something. 
I’m trying to read all of her books in order as a winter project and I’m definitely going to forgo reading those until the end."
450,cxqby7,4,"Really? LOL I loved her Marples. I read those as summertime beach books, since they were usually so quick. Poirot is more of a cozied up in a good chair series where you can think about where he is going with his quirks. Maybe it’s because Marple reminds me of a woman whom I adored in my hometown lol"
451,cxske7,5,"I'd suggest reading some fiction, too. Reading fiction builds empathy and empathy is a wonderful thing! Look for books about people nothing like you. 

Fiction is a HUGE section of books, but some of my favorites are Stardust by Neil Gaiman (anything by him, really), Sourdough by Robin Sloan, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry by Gabrielle Zevin, anything by Kurt Vonnegut, and Circe by Madeline Miller.

If you have a genre you like, I will suggest other books, too!"
452,cxxuar,5,The Princess Bride by Willam Goldman :)
453,cxxuar,10,Wheel of time?
454,cxxuar,3,"""Hyperion"" by Dan Simmons. That's an amazing book."
455,cxxuar,3,"The Guardians of the Flame series by Joel Rosenberg. A D&amp;D group gets transported into their game as their characters. It has wizards, dwarves, elves, thieves, clerics, dragons, the gang's all here. Fairly quick easy reads but adult themes. 

Anything by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. They're probably most famous for their Dragonlance novels, but my favorite by them is the Death Gate Cycle. They also wrote the Sovereign Stone, Rose of the Prophet, and Darksword series. They're all good. 

Terry Brooks of course writes the ongoing Shannarah series, but also the Magic Kingdom of Landover series is traditional fantasy. It's a little lighter in tone but a fun read. 

Robin Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings books starting with Assassin's Apprentice and including the Liveship trilogy. The overall story includes the Rain Wild series but be warned, those drag on. 

Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander are more YA but still good. 

Piers Anthony's comedic Xanth series and less comedic but still fairly light toned Apprentice Adept series are both great. He has other great series but they're less traditional fantasy."
456,cxxuar,10,Check out Brandon Sanderson
457,cxxuar,5,"Malazan Book of the Fallen - by Steven Erikson will fit in your description perfectly  

if you are looking for ""easy books"" try out David Eddings Belgariad &amp; Malloreon series or if you like to read the main story first and then expand from it start with ""Belgarath the sorcerer &amp; Polgara the Sorceress"" they are both ~750pages so its a good read that doesnt end to soon"
458,cxxuar,3,"The series lost editing control in the back nine and suffered for it. If you have time to spend Jordan was a good writer, but this recommendation should always come with a caveat."
459,cxxzz2,6,"I hope someone has a good recommendation, I’ve never heard of a hero to villain trope! I’d be very interested to read a book like that"
460,cxxzz2,7,"The best example of series, is Breaking Bad, in movies you can see Batman: The Dark Night, by Cristopher Nolan, the arc of Harvey Dent is awesome, that's my personal recommendation, good luck with your script"
461,cxxzz2,3,"Clarice isn't a villain, but I don't think Hannibal is only a villain either. He's one of my favorite characters in all of literature."
462,cxxzz2,19,"The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas.    
The Stars my Destination, by Alfred Bester.   
Fight Club, by Chuck Palahnuik."
463,cxxzz2,5,The young elites by Marie Lu !! Or the Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard ! Both YA but really good
464,cxxzz2,8,The Count of Monte Cristo is the perfect example. I wouldn't want him as my enemy.
465,cxxzz2,4,"Warcraft III, Arthas.

EDIT: I know there are books, I just don’t remember the exact titles."
466,cxxzz2,3,The Stars my Destination is a similar story... in space.
467,cxxzz2,8,The Picture of Dorian Gray is a good one :)
468,cxxzz2,3,I guess I am Legend by Richard Matheson fits this! It was a pretty quick read and I enjoyed it a lot! Definitely worth a try
469,cxxzz2,8,"It doesn't fit this exactly but you might find the book *Dark Matter* by Blake Crouch interesting. The book is a sci-fi about a man who is ripped away from his happy family an placed into an alternate reality and the lengths he will go through to get back to them. The book is a really cool exploration of the range of good and evil an individual is capable of and how different circumstances can drive a person in one direction or another. It is also a really cool take on the whole of ""the hero is the hero because we are reading from their POV."""
470,cxxzz2,9,It's an amazing book but I don't think he was ever a hero...
471,cxxzz2,3,I'm not sure if the Count is meant to be seen as a villain. I don't remember him ever being shown in a negative light for taking his revenge. I haven't read it in a while though
472,cxxzz2,4,"Yes but, he went from a pure soul to knowing no bounds to manufacture the means to his end.  His list of nefarious deeds reads like a rap sheet that would land anyone behind bars for a very long time, in almost any society in the history of Earth."
473,cxxzz2,3,Star Wars
474,cxxzz2,4,"No, it wasn't. Part of the point of the book was that his desire for revenge had spiraled wildly out of control and he was lashing out at people who didn't deserve it. His bodycount technically includes at least one small kid from what I remember."
475,cxxzz2,3,This one is just “Arthas”
476,cxxzz2,3,I only read the first one. But Warcross is amazing if you think you might want to try her again. Young Elites was the exception. I’ve loved everything else.

After getting a hunch, I started comparing what I was seeing on a regular account to an incognito mode browser and presto, a bunch of posts disappeared. Usually ones involving indie or lesser known authors, though the net is wide enough that even lists of a dozen books or more with names like ""Sanderson"" on them can vanish due to the presence of one indie author.

The mods seem to be picking and choosing winners and losers. They have no problem, for example, with one of Sanderson's own agents coming in and recommending his stuff constantly while up front admitting they were one of his agents and promoting his work (which I've seen happen here), and there is no rule against that. But at some point, they apparently decided to start picking favorites and ""cutting"" authors and books.

493,cztmee,4,"Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine - a re-telling of cinderella, but this book is genuinely funny and clever and the romance is not mushy and I would say is secondary to the heroine overcoming other things. 


Dealing with Dragons by Patricia C. Wrede- another fairy tale-esque book, but again very funny and clever. About a princess that runs away to live with dragons. 


A Wrinkle in time by Madeline L’Engle- a classic sci-fi, great heroine.  sometimes gets a little weird plot-wise.


All three of these are maybe middle grade or the lower reading level of YA, but I think they would also be fun books to read out loud- well written, good flow, funny, not too terribly wordy."

522,d7wsz0,6,"Anything written by Catherynne M. Valente has this rich feel to it like it's both something new but also an ancient folk tale with a ton of history behind it. The Orphan Tales is my favourite work of hers, but honestly a huge fan of everything I've read so far.

Ursula K. Le Guin also had her book Earthsea turned into a movie by Studio Ghibli... If you're familiar with the film and the story behind what happened during its production, you know that it's one of Studio Ghibli's films that is actually truly horrible. I usually love their work so that's really saying something. What they actually got done is beautiful to look at and captures the essence of the source material, but the project was missmanaged and they ran out of funding so the story doesn't flow or make any sense even to someone who has read the book and has a general idea of what's going on. It's very unfortunate. So I strongly suggest you read the original work"
523,d7xzv3,5,All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doer. It really is just a beautifully written book.
524,d7xzv3,3,"The first book that comes to mind is Pachinko by Min Jin Lee. 

It is a book I would never have chose for myself by Roxane Gay who is one of my favorite writers recommended it and I loved every minute of it."
525,d7xzv3,3,This is where I leave you
526,d7xzv3,4,"There are so many, but one that stands out (and I’m sure this is true for a lot of people) is *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. It captures life in such an authentic way. It’s beautifully written."

The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden

Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynn Jones and Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea cycle have both adapted into SG films"

530,d86by8,6,came here to say this!!
531,d86by8,5,Fouthed. Made me love reading.
532,d86by8,3,Dragonrider by Cornelia funke or the inkheart series by Cornelia funke
533,d86by8,4,"I was going to recommend Hachet. It's a book I suggest to get boys into reading. 

These are some books with an adventure, fantasy theme that are classics for a reason.  You can't ever go wrong...

540,d87fsx,3,"This is a pet peeve of mine, but ""modern"" endings are far more complex and likely to be nuanced than older stories a lot of the time.

""And they lived happily ever after"" is literally from fairy tales and a very, very ancient expectation from people regarding the end of a story, and has little to do with stories being ""modern"" and pretty much everything to do with your choices in available media.

*Gets off high horse*

A Little Life by Hanya Yanigahara tends to wreck people.

Paul Bowles' work might not be ""grueling"" but it's definitely not happy and has a uniquely bleak but dreamlike quality to the writing.  

Cormac McCarthy comes to mind.

Prince of Tides you might enjoy as well."

If you think you know a lot about the horror genre, about its conventions and influential/prominent works, think again; SGJ is on a whole 'nother level when it comes to minutiae and trivia and just general knowledge. Reading *Demon Theory* turns you into a walking horror encyclopedia, no lie."

548,d8ctcy,4,Is this book ruined having seen the Netflix show first?
549,d8ctcy,6,"No, not at all. The show is very loosely based on the book (they both have creepy houses and similarly named characters... that’s about it). The book is definitely worth a read"
550,d8ctcy,4,"The Woman in Black by Susan Hill gave me actual nightmares.

We Have Always Lived In The Castle by Shirley Jackson is also really creepy."
551,d8ctcy,6,"I just read a creepy book called The Cavendish Home for Girls and Boys. It’s got a horrifying lovecraftian feel to it. And Coraline vibes.

559,d8ctcy,8,"I’ll be gone in the dark by Michelle McNamara is the scariest book I’ve ever read and I read a lot of horror. It is non-fiction though. 

Also A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay is extremely creepy and the ending will break your heart."

571,dascho,3,"Strange the Dreamer was so good. The twists and turns are very much like Six of Crows. 

I dont know if you know but there are several other books that accompany Six of Crows. I also reccomend the prequel seires to the Six of Crows (Shadow and Bone, Siege and Storm, Ruin and Rising) by Leigh Bardugo. It's a different cast of characters but still good. They all keep you on your toes. Then there's Crooked Kingdom  which follows the Six of Crows book. Then there's the King of Scars which has some of the characters in the first trilogy and others from Six of Crows plus a few new ones. A new book is also expected to come out on Oct. 8 I believe."

Pretty much everything I've read by Robert A Heinlein, or Ursula k Le Guin. (Old favourites)
And I think my new favourite author is Catherynne Valente I love her work, and the Orphan Tales has a special place in my heart."
578,daz1h3,3,I really enjoyed Slade House by David Mitchell. Spooky and quirky.
579,dazgw1,6,"Have you also read Jackson's [We Have always Lived in the Castle] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle)? It's my favourite of her works.

If you want more haunted house there's Cherie Priest's [The Family Plot] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25543181-the-family-plot). It's not Shirley Jackson quality literature, but I found it an enjoyable read.

A new star on the horror firmament is [C. J. Tudor] (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15754327.C_J_Tudor). *The Hiding Place* has some supernatural elements, *The Chalk Man* doesn't.

And since you're a Lovecraft fan I want to recommend this very charming short story by Neil Gaiman, in case you don't know it already: [A Study in Emerald] (http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf)."
580,dazgw1,7,Anything by Paul Tremblay. I especially recommend 'Head Full of Ghosts'
581,dazgw1,3,I really enjoyed Slade House by David Mitchell. Spooky and quirky.
582,dazgw1,3,Wendigo is free on gutenberg.org.
583,dazgw1,5,"Have you read anything by Clive Barker? He’s a master at storytelling, bringing a sense of dread and new experience of horror. I recommend ‘The Hellbound Heart’ and ‘Books of Blood 1-3’ they are absolutely scary as hell but bring a lot of originality to the genre."
584,dazgw1,4,House of Leaves!
585,dazgw1,8,The Winter People by Jennifer McMahon really put me on edge. Very atmospheric and eerie.
586,dazgw1,6,Yrsa Siguroardottir write Icelandic crime novels but always have a paranormal and scary theme running through them. I Remember You is one of the first books I read by her and it does have some atmospherically creepy bits.
587,dazgw1,5,I heard “The Black Farm” is a real stomach-clencher.
588,dazgw1,11,"Misery by Stephen King honestly messed me up for a while, but I’m admittedly not usually one for scary things."
589,dazgw1,10,"Dark Matter by Michelle Paver was really spooky. It’s about a group of rich friends in the early 20th Century who go to explore the arctic on a private expedition. But there might be an evil spirit somewhere in the ice

For weird fiction I recommend Annihilation by Jeff   Vandermeer. There is a netflix film sooo you might know it, but I really liked it"

592,dazgw1,4,Bird Box
593,dazgw1,11,"Let the Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Not super recent but it’s one of very few horror books to really stick with me afterwards, and also a testament to the fact that vampire literature can still be good. It’s really unsettling and atmospheric with a few legitimately good scares in there as well. If anything the movie toned down how haunting it really is. Note of warning: if themes of pedophilia are a trigger for you this isn’t a good book to read."
594,dazgw1,7,"NOS4A2 by Joe Hill. I'm not a horror fan (although I seem to end up reading everything Hill's dad writes), but this book was scary enough to leave an impression and decently written as well."
595,dazgw1,6,No...I enjoyed each separately.
596,dazgw1,3,Came here to say this. He rules.
597,dazgw1,3,"Good to know. I knew they were somehow related, but I wasn’t sure if you needed to read The Bone Clocks to get Slade House. Thanks!"
598,dazgw1,5,"It's manga but ""Uzumaki"" by Junji Ito. You can find online easy.

Try his short story ""The Amigara Fault"" for a quick taste of his horror.

If you like that, read Drifting Classroom.

I feel horror is best served in pictures not words, in afraid. Though happy to be proven wrong"
599,dazgw1,3,The Luminous Dead by Caitlin Starling is a fantastic horror novel with a small cast of characters set entirely in a cave
600,dazgw1,3,Tomie by junji ito really fucked with my head it was brilliant. The pictures and imagery along with the idea itself it just freaked me out.   Uzamaki made me feel more like I liked the characters a lot  but I just couldn’t take snail people seriously I mean towards the end it didn’t scare me as much but I was hooked to see what would happen. But Tomie that shit really sent me cringing in fear
601,dazgw1,4,"I was gonna suggest House of Leaves. I think some people find it scarier than others although I guess that’s the same for everything. I found it really unsettling, which is probably my favourite type of horror."
602,dazgw1,3,"Have you tried reading any foreign horror novels?  In particular, The Ring and Parasite Eve are both books that freaked me out; you just need to make sure you have an official translation because it can be stupid nonsensical when you are trying to read a poorly translated text"

604,dazgw1,5,[deleted]
605,dazgw1,4,Was going to say this but thought it was more psychological thriller than horror. Absolutely amazing nonetheless tho
606,dazgw1,7,I don’t know about Bone Clocks. Do you recommend?
607,dazgw1,3,"I suggest you to take a look to Edgar Allan Poe's ""Extraordinary narrations"""
608,dazgw1,6,Not to be confused with Dark Matter by Blake Crouch which is also exceptional but it is a psych thriller
609,dazgw1,4,I thought this to be one of the most amazing books I've ever read. And I've read A LOT of books. Lol. Highly recommend.
610,dazgw1,3,HOUSE 👏🏻OF 👏🏻LEAVES 👏🏻
611,dazgw1,3,"As a huge fan of weird fiction I’m gonna have to say that Annihilation, although I’d classify as certainly “weird fiction”, wasn’t really scary at all- more just mysterious rather than anything else."

614,db3ypy,3,Certain Dark Things by Silvia Moreno-Garcia
615,db3ypy,7,"The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bolaño! It's about the lives of a collective of poets from Mexico City over the course of several years. It's beautiful, very bohemian and witty and expansive. I would definitely recommend to someone interested in magical realism or historical fiction, though it's not really either."
616,db3ypy,3,Battles in the Desert by Emilio Pacheco. It's a short story about a Mexican-American kid living in Mexico around the 50's and his first love experiences. The author describes very well the context of those times.
617,db3ypy,5,I just started reading Gods of Jade and Shadow by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. It doesn’t exclusively take place in Mexico City but it’s 1920s Mexico with Mayan gods among people so seems like it’ll check multiple boxes for ya!
618,dbd05v,3,"I affirm this rec as long as OP understands that it does not fall into the category of ""must-read literary classic,"" but instead is a great follow up for the kind of reader who grew up loving Harry Potter. It takes you into a fantastic world with an incredible character on a tragic journey, and the writing is just absurdly beautiful and enjoyable. It's legitimately not fair how good of a writer Rothfuss is, and I am reminded that every time I pick up any other book.

This is definitely a story to get lost in. But fair warning, the trilogy is not yet complete.

For the must-read classic on the other hand... you have to go with The Count of Monte Cristo."
619,dbfnka,4,The stars my destination
620,dbfnka,4,"You mean like the revenge theme, like the Napoleonic background and Parisian setting, or something else in particular?

For the background and setting try Victor Marie Hugo (_Les Misérables_ and _The Hunchback of Notre-Dame_).

For the revenge theme maybe _True Grit_ by Charles Portis or _Dune_ by Frank Herbert.

Or as a random shot in the dark try _The Glass Key_ by Dashiell Hammett or _Ivanhoe_ by Sir Walter Scott.

Then there is _Scaramouche_ by Rafael Sabatini, which should come close in background, setting, and theme, but I have not read that one yet."
621,dbfnka,5,"If you liked that one, you might want to read his Three Musketeers series."
622,dbfnka,3,I love Les Miserables too.
623,dbfnka,3,"The abridged Count of Monte Cristo? 

I never understood why abridged book exist, until I read Dumas."

627,dbge2m,3,"I started reading A Head Full of Ghosts because Stephen King recommended it on his Twitter but I am so completely and utterly turned off by mental illness being the ""monster"" in horror media that I gave up almost immediately. But people really insist it's great. Is it worth it to push through?"
628,dcptpy,3,"Oh, Kvothe. I read this book and loved it. Now I'm in agony waiting for Patrick Rothfuss to finish the darn series! C'mon man!"

630,dcwrpc,3,"*If At Birth You Don't Succeed* by Zach Anner

&gt; Comedian Zach Anner opens his frank and funny book, *If at Birth You Don't Succeed*, with an admission: he botched his own birth. Two months early, underweight, and under-prepared for life, he entered the world with cerebral palsy and an uncertain future. So how did he blossom into a viral internet sensation who's hosted two travel shows, impressed Oprah, driven the Mars Rover, and inspired a John Mayer song? (It wasn't ""Your Body Is a Wonderland."") *If at Birth You Don't Succeed* is an irreverent and heartfelt memoir about finding your passion and your path even when it’s paved with epic misadventure. “An inspirational memoir with a seasoned, infectious sense of humor,” our reviewer writes."
631,dd7sk2,3,"I may be wrong, but if I remember correctly his kind are forbidden from interacting with anyone on their period..."
632,dd7sk2,3,"And keep in mind that there were many biblical texts floating around during that time that were not included. The book of Enoch was widely accepted &amp; taught, but left out of the canons that were included in the version of the Bible we have today. Different sects of Christianity had other scriptures they followed. I recommend looking into the Gnostic Gospels, as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Specifically, the Book of Enoch &amp; the Gospel of Thomas. I grew up forced to go to church 3x a week &amp; always found it confusing as a child, always felt there was something ""more"" to the story so have always been interested in finding those missing pieces. Just my two cents!"
633,dd7sk2,3,"I was raised Baptist and although I don't attend church anymore, I do read the Bible daily. I figure I can read what it says for myself. I don't need someone else to tell me. The culture in the churches is toxic."
634,dd7sk2,4,"The Bible is one of the most significant anthropological artifacts extant today. The tale of Moses (whether or not he is a historical or fictional character) was written some 3500 years ago --well before the Common Era. Additionally, we don't know how far back the stories in Genesis are set, but they are most likely oral tradition passed down over an unknown number of generations before even getting to Moses' era. Even the most recently scribed manuscripts were written at or around the time of the life of Jesus of Nazareth about 2000 years ago. It's a time capsule to an era alien to us, allowing to search into the minds and imaginations of those who experienced life in a categorically different way from our own. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for recommendations of which parts to read, I would say absolutely all of Genesis, and then the tale of Moses in the first half of Exodus. From Exodus 20 (where you will find The Ten Commandments) through until almost the end of Deuteronomy is some of the earliest recorded legislation extant, if that interests you. And then from Joshua through 2 Chronicles are what are known as the Histories (although their historical accuracy is of question to anthropologists and archeologists), which tell tales of God and war, conquest and sacrifice. The rest of the Old Testament is mostly old men telling Israel they need to repent, but there is also Psalms, which is a collection of songs and poems from ancient Judah and Israel, and the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes were written by King Solomon, a sort of philosopher king a la Marcus Aurelius of Rome --the wisdom and aphorisms found therein still being applicable today (especially Ecclesiastes; if you only read one book, make it Ecclesiastes).  Oh, and also the book of Daniel from the OT; that's where we get the story Daniel and the Lion's Den and others; it also describes the account of a series of dreams or visions the author reportedly saw which I find fascinating.  As for the New Testament, I would recommend reading at least one of the gospels, and then the book of Revelations. For the gospels, Matthew presents the most full account of the last couple years of Jesus' life, Luke tells more of his full life's story (this is where we find the Nativity story), and John shares the most allegorical account of the events.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps."
635,dd7sk2,3,"As a Catholic who was a music minister for several protestant congregations, ""I was absolutely stunned to learn that the people there did not read the Bible.""

They had a great handle on memorizing verses from sermons, but no idea of the larger picture.

My advice is plow through in one version, then pick another one and compare them. Then do another. I think I've read at least twelve so far.

I can't even begin to tell you how helpful biblical knowledge is for reading any Western literature written before the 20th century."
636,dd7sk2,4,"You're correct in that globally the majority of art throughout history has not dealt with Jesus, but if we are speaking about western art it is essentially impossible to write, paint, film etc. without being aware of and reacting to in some way the mark of Christianity on culture. It's just so annoyingly ingrained in everything. It's like that game you play where you say something and see how long it takes you to get back to penises."

640,ddi9mp,4,"Pet cemetery,  Carrie or Duma Key"
641,ddi9mp,5,The stand
642,ddi9mp,3,Duma Key is a great ghost story. It is one of my favorites!
643,ddi9mp,3,"It was terrible! They injected characters instead of developing a way to enter Jake's inner monologue. They cut out HUGE chunks of what makes the love story between Jake and Sadie. It diverged to far from the book to even be considered an adaptation of the book, if you ask me."
644,ddlm34,3,"Thank you anyway, that's so sweet 🙂 Internet hugs right back at you!"
645,ddpkng,8,"I enjoy reading dystopic fiction and would recommend the Dystopia Decathlon of:

1. The Time Machine by HG Wells

2. We by Y Zamyatin

3. 1984 by George Orwell

4. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (I'd argue it's the closest thing to a utopia we would ever get to)

5. The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood

6. A Scanner Darkly by Philip K Dick

7. The Road by Cormac McCarthy

8. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

9. The Long Walk by Stephen King (shoutout to the Running Man)

10. A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter Miller

The short story I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream by Harlan Ellison, is the Dystopia's idea of a Dystopia (also A Boy and His Dog by Ellison but I find it a bit distasteful).


Notable mentions to these two books which I would consider dystopias if you read them to their ending:
&gt;!I am legend by Richard Matheson and Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro!&lt;"
646,ddpkng,6,"Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood. Genetic engineering, environmental collapse, weird creatures..."
647,ddpkng,9,"Try"" the giver"" I dont remember the author but I absolutely loved the book"
648,ddpkng,6,The last page first 😱😱 how do you do that
649,ddpkng,7,I really enjoyed Red Rising by Pierce Brown. It is also scifi and comments on what leadership is and has many mythical allusions. Plus it is absolutely entertaining and hard to put down.
650,ddpkng,3,The Road and The Long Walk both killed me. They stayed with me for a long time after reading them.
651,ddpkng,3,I'm glad I saw your question. The responses gave me some great suggestions as well.
652,ddpkng,3,Lois Lowry! I read The Giver as a kid but reread it a few years ago. It's still so good.
653,ddpkng,3,The road wrecked me
654,ddpkng,3,"Snowcrash by Neal Stephenson. Especially good for sci-fi readers. The plot is not focused on the dystopic setting, but the setting is integral to the plot. Truly a fun and interesting take on libertarianism gone awry. Utterly fantastic. Written in 1992 and highly predictive of the current world, Stephenson was/is dubbed a profit. I wholeheartedly agree and endorse."
655,ddpkng,3,"I'd recommend Margaret Atwood's trilogy - Oryx and Crake, MadAdam, and Year of the Flood. Frighteningly plausible.

Paolo Bacigalupi's Windup Girl is also excellent."
656,ddpkng,4,Oryx and Crake was amazing. Truly weird but thought-provoking.
657,ddpkng,3,The Wool series!
658,ddrh3i,52,"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World, Cal Newport"
659,ddrh3i,25,"As another Redditor has already mentioned, Cal Newport is good for this in his books ""Digital Minimalism"" and ""Deep Work"".  Some other good books such as ""The Shallows: What the internet is doing to our brains"", by Nicholas Carr and ""Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping us Hooked"" by Adam Alter do a good job of outlining techniques. Outside of books, I would also recommend the subreddit /r/nosurf and the [Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com/)."
660,ddrh3i,23,Reddit is certainly ironic place to ask this question 😂
661,ddrh3i,3,"Warcross by Marie Lu  -  One of my all time favorites! I’m adding a synopsis ⬇️

For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn’t just a game- its a way of life. The obsession started ten years ago and its fan base now spans the globe, some eager to escape reality and others hoping to make a profit. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. But the bounty hunting world is a competitive one, and survival has not been easy. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the International Warcross Championships— only yo accidentally glitch herself into the action and becoming and overnight sensation. Convinced she’s going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game’s creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. He needs a spy on the inside of this year’s tournament in order to uncover a security problem... and he wants Emika for the job. With no time to lose, Emika’s whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she’s only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire."
662,ddrh3i,9,Its a loophole to get out of his addiction :)
663,ddrh3i,5,Just this once...
664,ddrh3i,3,"I know it’s mainstream popular and reviews are wishy washy, but if the synopsis you provide here is intriguing to you I’d try Ready Player One. There’s enough similarities to the synopsis that I think you’d enjoy it. I’m going to check out Warcross now for sure. Thanks for the advice and breakdown!"
665,ddrh3i,3,Did you answer the wrong question dude?
666,ddrh3i,17,How about you pay for the creator's hard work instead of stealing?
667,ddrh3i,3,"This book is much more different from Ready Player One than you’d think, so you’ll be in for a surprise, I really think you’ll enjoy it. In this universe the technology has actually helped in the development of the planet instead of destroying it by making humans neglect the real world like in Ready Player One. Which is the main reason why i prefer it, it’s a much more uplifting future which is always nice to dream of. Also, you should know it’s the first in a duo-logy, but definitely worth checking out!"
668,ddrh3i,3,Oh
669,ddrh3i,3,fair enough 👍
670,ddtpxu,9,Go for Something Wicked This Way Comes or The Halloween Tree by Ray Bradbury:D
671,ddtpxu,4,"Shirley Jackson might be up your alley, try The Haunting of Hill House.  The King in Yellow by Robert W. Chambers is also supernatural creepy but not outright terrifying as well."
672,ddtpxu,3,"Hex by Thomas Olde Heuvelt (I may have butchered the spelling) it's a slow-dread sort of book, for me it was perfectly Halloween-y but it does get mixed reviews."
673,ddtpxu,3,Really? We got an ARC at work for review which came with a needle and thread to SEW OUR OWN EYES SHUT with and I’ve been pretty sure I’m not up to reading that ever since.
674,ddtpxu,3,"Great book, literally took me three years to finish it."
675,de25q3,4,"[*Carry On*](https://www.rainbowrowell.com/carry-on) by Rainbow Rowell.  Set at a fantasy boarding school in the characters’ final year, the M/M protagonists have to deal with a looming threat to their school and magic society but are mostly coming to terms with the fact that they’re crazy about each other.


If you liked *Red, White, and Royal Blue* then I bet you’ll dig it, plus there’re POC characters, action, and fantasy elements galore."
676,de25q3,3,"It is a e-book but it is available as an audiobook as well so I will recommend it nevertheless. 

*Captive Prince* trilogy by CS Pacat. 

The rightful heir to Akeilos throne, Damen has his identity taken from him and sold into slavery after his half brother seizes power. Damen is given as a gift to Laurent, a prince of the enemy kingdom of Vere. Caught as a lowly pawn within Vere's court politics, Damen must try to make his circumstances turn to his favor all while not revealing his true identity to Laurent. Laurent may be manipulative but he is Damen's real hope of any chance of returning home.

If you can accept a little bit of Stockholm/Lima syndrome vibe, this is an excellent series with court politic manipulations the likes of Game of Thrones as well as some good battle scenes."
677,de25q3,3,The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue by Mackenzi Lee
678,de25q3,3,"I personally like the Madeleine Urban and Abigail Roux  Cut &amp; Run series.    They did come out in paperback, but for some reason used copies on Amazon are a million bucks.  Still affordable on Kindle if you can bite the bullet and use the e-reader. 

I second the CS Pacat books.  They had origins in the fanfic world, which you feel a bit in the salaciousness of the beginning of the story, but they become meticulously crafted and the characters well done.

Edit:  good luck to you!"
679,de2s9l,3,I read Normal People by Sally Rooney a while ago and it's a very enjoyable read as well as being easy to get through. It's about a guy and a girl who date on and off at high school and through uni in Ireland - it explores their relationship quite thoughtfully and there are snippets of great description.
680,de2s9l,3,"What movies does she like? That could give you a clue about genres. 


Alternatively, you could choose a book that inspired a movie. She might get into it easier if she has the plot and visuals from the film already established in her mind."
681,de2s9l,3,"Maybe pick a novella. They’re shorter and less of a commitment. They often are very focused because of this. 

Some of my favorite novellas (this is mostly fantasy, horror, scifi but there are tons of great non-genre novellas too if that’s what she’d prefer)

Every Heart a Doorway by Seanan McGuire

The Mist by Stephen King

Binti by Nnedi 

We are all completely fine by Darryl Gregory"
682,de2s9l,3,"my first thought was The Princess Bride. It's fun, engaging, got romance and humor and adventure, and it's a page-turner, but not overwhelming. I don't think I've ever met someone who didn't like it. :)"
683,de2s9l,3,The Crazy Rich Asians trilogy is an easy and funny read with plenty of romance. The film adaption is also great and mostly faithful to the first book.
684,de2s9l,3,The first one to engage me again when I got back into reading after a slump was Simon and the Homosapiens’ Agenda. Couldn’t put it down and breezed through it in a sitting
685,de4e64,3,I'm just hoping to find some good ones in this thread.
686,de9twq,71,The Gift of Fear
687,de9twq,9,Came here to suggest this one!
688,de9twq,9,Great minds think alike ;)
689,de9twq,3,"May not be quite what your looking for, but Code of the Street by Elijah Anderson is a good read."
690,de9twq,6,*Gang Leader for a Day*
691,de9twq,41,Theres a reason theres a distinction between street smart and book smart. Maybe just find a trustworthy local?
692,de9twq,21,"All great suggestions. Practical: *Scam Me If You Can* \- new book by Frank Abagnale, author of *Catch Me If You Can*. It's a concise, skimmable manual to spotting all kinds of frauds so you don't fall for them. If you want more of a page-turner, check out my own new book: *Cleantech Con Artists: A True Vegas Caper.* It's a nonfiction, man-bites-dog true crime caper wrapped in a history of Las Vegas. It's the story of how my graduate studies at UNLV uncovered a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme led by a mastermind using an alias who was a genius at hypnosis and Photoshop forgery, and what my friends and I did about it. Good luck!"
693,de9twq,14,Nothing more practical than a good theory. Methinks the optimum smarts is a combination of both...
694,de9twq,8,I second the book “the gift of fear”.
695,de9twq,58,Anything by JJ Bittenbinder
696,de9twq,8,"Mark MacYoung's ""Safe in the City"" and ""Street E &amp; E"" (escape and evasion) are old but good. He's done a lot of good work lately about self defense and its legal aspects, but these two older volumes apply most closely to your question. 

I second the vote for Gavin de Becker's ""Gift of Fear."" It is the #1 book I recommend to friends and I give it to each of my children as they reach their teen years."
697,de9twq,4,"Just out of curiosity, how is your book doing?"
698,de9twq,6,"There's a reason it's called street smarts... if you really want to learn you have to go outside, visit places you don't know and try something adventurous"
699,de9twq,26,Throw them off their rhythm!
700,de9twq,21,STREET SMARTS
701,de9twq,8,"I'd say read the reviews on Amazon, &amp; start reading the preview to see if it draws you in. And I have over 430,000 followers on LinkedIn, so it's doing pretty well &amp; I am doing pretty well."
702,de9twq,15,"To quote JJ himself, “You want it? Go get it!”"
703,de9twq,5,"That's what he/she's doing. Studying abroad in another country is very adventurous, but as someone who has studied abroad, I can say there's nothing wrong with wanting to learn a little before you go so you can be cautious. Otherwise, a ""lesson learned"" might be getting scammed, mugged or pickpocketed - all things an adventure abroad can do without."
704,de9twq,4,"Rather than only reading a book consider taking a self-defense martial arts course. You learn how to be aware of your surroundings, how to tell when somebody is antagonistic, and you develop enough confidence and experience not to just freeze up. More importantly your teacher is likely to be street smart and to care about your well-being. They could be a great resource for you."
705,de9twq,16,"Even better, find an untrustworthy local and let experience be your teacher"
706,de9twq,4,r/unexpectedmulaney
707,de9twq,6,Engraved?
708,deafh9,5,"Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand, The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper or The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry"
709,deafh9,3,I agree with The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. Gorgeous.
710,deby7j,4,Patricia Nell Warren was an amazing gay novel writer and she wrote one named The Front Runner. Paul Newman bought the film rights and it’s not really a mystery but the finale made me cry. It’s slow start but still an incredible book.
711,deby7j,6,Wow this is a really cool question.  I'm mainly a fan of psychological thriller and biographies so I guess I should give exploring other genres a try lol. Good luck to you!
712,deby7j,6,"The Watchmaker of Filigree Street and The Bedlam Stacks by Natasha Pulley are both pretty cozy, pretty gay, and pretty mysterious. Watchmaker is the only one with an explicit gay relationship, but Bedlam Stacks is a much cozier and better book and although the main characters don't kiss or anything, it's...pretty hard to read them as straight? Plus, the author is clearly comfortable writing queer themes, so!"
713,deby7j,3,"*In a Dark, Dark Wood* by Ruth Ware is fun, quick to read, interesting, and has a solid gay character in it."
714,dedl1c,3,Without revealing which is which
715,dg5lbk,3,"Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov, or Crime and Punishment. These will get you hooked on Russian classic lit. The best."
716,dg5lbk,3,"Paradise Lost. Technically a poem, not a novel, but it's an absolute masterpiece."
717,dg5lbk,3,"* *Pride and Prejudice*
* *Jane Eyre*
* *Wuthering Heights*
* *Dracula*
* *A Christmas Carol*"
718,dg5lbk,3,Wuthering heights
719,dhclh2,3,The Godfather can never hurt.
720,dj5b3z,4,"A great quote from WH Auden: ""There are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.""

Besides which, as others have pointed out, the Discworld series is largely intended for an older audience, though it is widely approachable."
721,dj5b3z,3,Me seven!
722,dj5b3z,4,"They mean that in class, literature that would be otherwise enjoyed is overanalyzed to the point of boredom."
723,dj5b3z,3,"There are guides online, but basically there are different series within the books, one following a wizard, one about a City Watch (my favourites), one about a coven of witches etc and some stand alones.

Personally I think they get better as they go on, and the first two books are definitely not the best, I think I read them after I’d read most of the others. I wouldn’t say any of the books rely on knowledge from the previous ones and I read them all completely out of order the first time I read them, as I was getting them from the school library!"
724,dj5b3z,3,"I'm seconding *Little Women*. Parts of it are sad, but the heartwarming friendships and sisterhood make up for it. The sequels are really good, too. I had to smile at all the scrapes that the Plumfield children got into in *Little Men*.

P.S. I don't think it's weak to avoid reading sad books. It sounds like you know and respect your limitations, which is very wise IMO. I also have a depressive personality and have to be careful what I read."
725,dj5b3z,3,Oh god! Stay away from Tess of the durburvilles! That wrecked me!!
726,dj5b3z,3,The Secret Garden! I've never felt more refreshed than after reading that book.
727,djfej5,4,The Shining. Hands down the scariest book I’ve read.
728,djfej5,3,"Fear is subjective, so my choice may not be the scariest for you. That said, the novella ""Horrible Imaginings"" by Fritz Leiber is the only piece of fiction that unsettled me to such an extent that I had to put it aside and go to a lighted part of the house for about twenty minutes before I returned to it. I had been reading it in the dark, next to my wife, who was sleeping, and I became so uneasy by about two-thirds through that I stopped reading. It's in a Leiber collection of the same name. The rest of the stories are good, but he knocked it out of the park on this one."
729,djfej5,3,IT by Stephen King... especially chapter 17: another one of the missing: The Death of Patrick Hockstetter... terrifying... I read the book 3 times... this chapter always snags me...
730,dki4pj,3,"So, as far as the Greek myths go:

Seconding **Song of Achilles** and **Circe**, both by Madeleine Miller.

**Troy** and **Ithaka** by Adèle Geras. Troy deals with the siege of Troy, and Ithaka deals with the Odysseus myth. Both fantastic.

**The Gods of Love** by Nicola Mostyn. Fast moving, pretty fun.

Gods/magic in general:

**Deathless** by Catherine M. Valente. Picks up on the myth of Kotschei the Deathless from Russian mythology, and ties it in with the Russian revolution. Fantastic story, highly recommend.

**The Rivers of London** by Ben Aaronovitch. Lots of magic, bit of a love letter to London and its history, and the protag finds out about gods and spirits etc in modern day London.

**The Shambling Guide to New York** by Mur Lafferty. Not so much myth, but has the same secret mythical world that we only know about in stories but really does exist vibe. I think there are some minor gods from various mythos, but I may be misremembering.

Kind of veering off into fairytale but still fits the super close to the actual myth they portray:

**The Child Thief** by Gerald Brom. Dark retelling of Peter Pan with a heavy sprinkling of Celtic mythology."
731,dki4pj,3,"Oh my god and it's a trilogy. Right, there goes my week. Cheers for this!"
732,dki4pj,4,"Lots of urban fantasy novels, especially Simon Green's Nightside and Secret Histories series and Jim Butcher's Dresden Files"
733,dki4pj,3,"There's also the Aeneid (as seen here), [according to this Q&amp;A](https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1237999-is-there-a-genre-that-you-haven-t-yet):

&gt; For my next novel, I am mulling over two stories, one inspired by Vergil's Aeneid and one by Shakespeare's Tempest, both of which keep me in the same basic area as The Song of Achilles and Circe."
734,dki4pj,3,"Lore Olympus is a webcomic on WEBTOON and is just centered on Persephone and Hades as of now. It might expand later, but it’s been a slow burn. It’s really good and even getting an animated series soon."
735,dkjlu2,4,"The Unfortunate Fursey by Mervyn Wall. An Irish monastery is tormented by the devil because one of the monks is too scared to recite the exorcism prayers. The other monks kick him out, and the devil feels bad and decides to help the expelled monk as an apology. Hilarity ensues."
736,dklluo,6,Murakami
737,dklluo,3,Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China by Jung Chang
738,dklluo,5,I'll second Han Kang. Human Acts is absolutely amazing.
739,dkshew,3,The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared
740,dkthr5,3,Commenting because I would love to read those too!
741,dkthr5,4,"Gracefully Insane by Alex Beam is pretty good, it’s a history of the McLean mental hospital in Massachusetts."
742,dl52t4,3,"Enders Game, How to Kill a Mockingbird, A Dog called Homeless, and really any Ray Bradbury book (including Fahrenheit 451)"
743,dl52t4,3,"Purple Hibiscus, The Book Thief and The Kite Runner really really great for ages 13 upwards 

Great Gatsby is a classic and is usually taught so it is an option 

A really fun book that is also quite educational is Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime 

For something cool, we read Fight Club (16+) 

For 17/18 year olds I would suggest A Thousand Splendid Suns - one of the best books I ever read. 

 (We read way more in high school and if you want more suggestions I’ve got lots)"
744,dl52t4,3,"Things Fall Apart  and To Kill a Mockingbird were my favourite required reading novels in High School.

Watchmen, Siddhartha and On The Road were my favourite book I read on my own.

I couldn't stand Catcher in the Rye at that age"
745,dl6n5j,3,"It's not pop history, but if you read Germinal by Emile Zola you'll get a good idea of what workers' lives were like before unions got to be a thing. It's quite astonishing to see how far we've come.

You might also like Nickled &amp; Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich. Again, not pop history, but definitely relevant."
746,dl9ir7,4,The Winter Witch by Paula Brackston
747,dlsf6v,5,Try the punningly sounding (based on your question) **A World Lit Only By Fire** by William Manchester.  Barbara Tuchman's **A Distant Mirror** focusing on the 14th century may also interest you.
748,dlu05o,3,"I haven't read that. But will for sure check it out. Your comment reminded me of ""The Cup is Already Broken,"" which I love and have shared a lot. 

“You see this goblet?” asks Achaan Chaa, the Thai meditation master. “For me this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‘Of course.’ When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.”"
749,dm3c1u,3,"Unfortunately I don’t know of anything specific to young lesbians, but for anyone going to college the Freshman Survival Guide is great. See if your school has a gender studies department, mine was one of the most LGBTQ-supportive places I’ve ever been to and I’ve been to Pride at NYC"
750,dm57gp,3,Usually reading an old favorite or a light and easy book will pull me out of a slump. What kind of books do you like?
751,dm57gp,3,The Firm got me out of mine
752,dm5c25,3,You could try A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold. He is considered the father of ecology. The book paints beautiful landscapes with snippets of wildlife and comes up with concepts that even today many people fail to grasp. I thought it was a lovely and inspiring read.
753,dm6aip,9,"There’s many great books older than 100 years! To help narrow it down, what type of books have you enjoyed previously? Any particular genre?"
754,dm6aip,6,"Alice in Wonderland

Don Quixote 

exciting news,  we are 10 years from Red Harvest being 100 years old."
755,dm6aip,8,"Charles Dickens - so much less stuffy than people think they are. They’re hugely enjoyable, moving, pacy reads."
756,dm6aip,9,"""Notes from Underground"", ""Brothers Karamazov"", ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""Idiot"" all by Fyodor Dostoyevsky."
757,dm6aip,6,Gulliver's Travels
758,dm6aip,11,"I'm currently reading Doestoyevsky's *Crime And Punishment*, and to me it has been a very good read so far.  I've got the David McDuff translation.

I would second Cervantes' *Don Quixote*, as another user has commented, as well as the following ones that I've read:

*The Divine Comedy* by Dante  
*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccaccio  
*Robinson Crusoe* by Daniel Defoe  
*Candide* by Voltaire  
*The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame* by Victor Hugo  
*The Picture Of Dorian Gray* by Oscar Wilde  
*The Portrait Of An Artist As A Young Man* by James Joyce

Keep in mind that most of these are not particularly easy reads, but they can be rewarding in the end if you are motivated enough to finish them."
759,dm6aip,5,Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte...I loved it. However forgot i read it but as soon as I read your question it automatically popped into my head not knowing year it  was published—searched it up &amp; says it was published 1847. :)
760,dm6aip,37,Frankenstein by Mary Shelley! One of my favorite books.
761,dm6aip,7,Pride and Prejudice was enjoyable. Jane Eyre is a bit of a slog but the story is compelling
762,dm6aip,7,Everything by Tolstoy.
763,dm6aip,3,"The Ancient Lowly -- A history of the ancient working people from the earliest known period to the adoption of Christianity by Constantine, by C. Osborne Ward, 1888. Two volumes."
764,dm6aip,13,Everything from Jules Verne! He was really far ahead of his time
765,dm6aip,3,On the origin of species. Charles Darwin
766,dm6aip,18,Huckleberry Finn
767,dm6aip,44,The Count of Monte Cristo
768,dm6aip,8,I recently read One man's wilderness and loved it
769,dm6aip,7,Like almost all of classic literature. Victor Hugo's got some great stuff like Les Miserables and Hunchback of Notre Dame.
770,dm6aip,5,"Some of the best without exception:

Sterne: Tristram Shandy

Defoe: Henry Fielding

Burney: Evelina

Richardson: Pamela

Dumas: Count of Monte Cristo

Hawthorne: The Scarlett Letter

Cervantes: Don Quixote

Eliot: Middlemarch

These alone will keep you in reading for months, some are very long. All are immersive."
771,dm6aip,10,Juat finished this today! Totally not what I had expected of the book. It was absolutely beautiful!
772,dm6aip,8,I LOVED Great Expectations so much more than expected. It's funny and heartbreaking and weirdly relatable.
773,dm6aip,6,Journey to the Center of the Earth was really good; Jules Verne is excellent at painting a scene. IIRC none of his books are particularly long so if you don't enjoy his writing style it's not much time lost.
774,dm6aip,19,Dracula by Bram Stoker
775,dm6aip,7,"Selected Stories - Anton Chekhov

Crime and Punishment - Fyodor Dostoevsky

My Antonia - Willa Cather"
776,dm6aip,3,"Oooooh, I'm gonna hit you with some good ones. Nemili-Nedragi and Under the yoke by the famous Bulgarian author Ivan Vazov. I'm not sure whether you'll be able to find a translation of Nemili-Nedragi but I know for a fact that there is  a translation of Under the yoke.  


They are, for lack of a better phrase, realistic fiction. The stories in them did not actually happen but they show what it was like living in Bulgaria while it was under Ottoman oppression in great detail."
777,dm6aip,5,The Scarlet Pimpernel - outrageous English nobleman rescuing French aristocrats from the guillotine.
778,dm6aip,5,The Scarlet Letter
779,dm6aip,4,da bibble?
780,dm6aip,3,I want to marry you
781,dm6aip,14,Moby Dick is awesome and Wuthering Heights is still one of my favorite books
782,dm6aip,6,I'm a little over 3/4ths through this right now and I'm really enjoying it. The journal style writing leads to such a slow burn but the story keeps you hooked the entire time
783,dm6aip,6,Candide by Voltaire was life changing for me if you haven’t already read it.
784,dm6aip,10,This one is the obvious choice here. The Three Musketeers from Dumas is also good
785,dm6aip,6,Three Men in a Boat
786,dm6aip,18,"Not with that username, u didn’t lol"
787,dm6aip,3,"Ok, honest question here: what is it about this book you liked? I’ve recently read it cover to cover and I absolutely hated it. Can you help me see it in a different light and not as a waste of my time?"
788,dm6aip,12,The Odyssey and the Illiad!
789,dm6aip,3,The scarlet letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Oil! by Upton Sinclair

791,dm6aip,3,Fathers and Sons - Turgenev
792,dm6aip,5,"Ah, another person with excellent 18th century taste, I see.

I love how Tristram Shandy routinely fucks with people’s minds if they go into it blindly—yes, House of Leaves wasn’t THAT original in its typography and layout!"
793,dm6aip,5," Zadig by Voltaire (1747)

 Jacques The Fatalist and his Master by Denis Diderot (1785)

794,dm6aip,4,"Wuthering Heights. The first chapter can be a little thick to get through, but once it gets going, it sets the intended mood so well that you can't help but get sucked into Catherine and Heathcliff's world"
795,dm6aip,17,I also own u/daddyfister69
796,dm6aip,3,The awakening! Classic women’s literature
797,dm6aip,6,"And the latter's two sequels, Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne."
798,dm6aip,3,Nicholas Nickelby - not so much
799,dm6aip,3,"Little Women, Pride and Prejudice, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.

Gulliver's Travels? I havent read this one yet, but I hear good things."
800,dm6aip,6,"I couldn’t get into it, read the first chapter when I was about 14 and I didn’t like it- may give it a revisit now though"
801,dm6aip,6,The Great Gatsby won’t qualify for another 6 years but I feel it deserves a place here. Beautifully crafted and written.
802,dm6aip,3,Journey to the west is one of my favs
803,dm6aip,7,George Eliot had all the stuff I liked about Jane Austen and none of the things I didn't! She's a much better author imo.
804,dm6aip,4,Was looking for this so I didn't have to say it.
805,dm6aip,5,Had to read it for college and was dreading it. Ended up loving it. Great book.
806,dm6aip,7,"Did you read the Alexander Buss translation, unabridged? I don't know how other translations read, but the whole fan community agrees its the way to do it."
807,dm6aip,7,"A Study in Scarlet, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles, all by Arthur Conan Doyle."
808,dm6aip,5,I came here to suggest this book and I’m glad it’s already here!!
809,dm6aip,5,"Here are my favorites, in chronological order, going from recent to old.

*Dracula,* Bram Stoker, 1897

*The Count of Monte Cristo,* Alexandre Dumas, 1844 - 1846 (serialized)

*Don Quixote,* Miguel de Cervantes, 1605

*Le Morte d'Arthur,* Thomas Mallory, 1485

*Beowulf,* unknown, approximately 1000 ad (I suggest the Seamus Heaney or J R R Tolkien translations)

I love all of these, but my favorites would be *The Count, Beowulf,* and *Dracula*.

Random edit, my friend just finished *The Iliad,* Homer, 1194 bc - 1184 bc, and he loved it and has strongly recommended it to me."
810,dm6aip,6,I have a George Eliot book that I haven’t read I might just pick it up next
811,dm6aip,15,I second crime and punishment
812,dm6aip,3,What's Red Harvest about?
813,dm6aip,8,"&gt; Candide by Voltaire

This is what I'm seconding the most right now. If you have any passing interest in philosophy and snarky wittiness in the vein of Terry Pratchett and the like, this is a must read. 

Lots of philosophy-related works out there that are certainly worth reading. 

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius comes to mind, for example."
814,dm6aip,11,"The first chapter is a bit weird, but I stuck with it. It’s kind of like a cross between *Wuthering Heights* and a Jules Verne novel."
815,dm6aip,9,I third crime and punishment.
816,dm6aip,3,r/usernamedoesnotcheckout
817,dm6aip,4,"Jack London 
Start with “Call of the Wild”"
818,dm6aip,3,I second “My Antonia”!
819,dm6aip,5,Great crime novel.    Inspired many classic movies.    Guy comes to town and turns the gangs against each other.
820,dm6aip,13,"Dostoyevsky takes commitment though, definitely not light reading - but there is a satisfying payoff when you put in the effort."
821,dm6aip,3,"Wow! Over 100 years, huh? You’re gonna freak when you find out about Shakespeare."
822,dm6aip,13,"Anne of Green Gables by LM Montgomery. One of my favorite series of books growing up. I still reread them  every couple of years. Anne is an orphan who is adopted by mistake (they wanted a boy to help on the farm) They decide to keep her, and the story is her growing up getting into scrapes and making friends. It has love and romance. Gilbert Blyth was one of my first loves! :-) If you have children I recommend reading them out loud together. That was my first experience with them, my mom read them to me. 

Little House on the Prairie Series by Laura Ingles Wilder. This was another series I could not put down and still reread every few years. My mom read them to me when I was little as well. In fact she got sick of reading them and told me I would have to read them myself now, which is how I started reading chapter books. Little House in the Big Woods is the first book and it is a little childish, they get better and better. 

It is about the author and her family who are living in I think the 1870s and 1880s they are a pioneer family that takes their covered wagon out west. She wrote the books when she was an older woman based on her life memories of helping to settle the wild west :-). It is such a good book series, I love the fact that it is a true story about real people. 

These book series are my favorites and I recommend reading them. Very good coming of age novels.

 Also if you read either series as a kid I recommend reading them again as an adult there is a lot of things that change reading with adult eyes and emotions. It is amazing who a book changes it's meaning depending on what stage of life you the reader are on."
823,dm6aip,4,"I couldn't handle this one since English isn't my native. Barely finished first 2-3 pages.

But! I can recommend all the rest:  In Search of the Castaways - fascinating, The Mysterious Island - haunting,  20,000 Leagues Under the Sea - imagine 'inventing' submarines 50+ years ahead of their time.

What a wonderful author."
824,dm6aip,3,"I *love* Frankenstein so much! I read it over the summer and it’s just so interesting, and it’s cool to compare it to different versions of it!"
825,dm6aip,6,"Psmith In The City by PG Wodehouse.

Pre WWI.

A comic masterpiece on basically being low man on the corporate totem pole.

Anyone who has ever had a bleak office job can relate."
826,dm6aip,3,"Tale of Genji

Epic of Gilgamesh

Beowulf (Tolkien Translation)

Dracula (still scares me)

Anna Karenina

Through the Looking Glass"
827,dm6aip,10,The think about Gothic literature is it really captures the fear of the French Revolution spreading to England.
828,dm6aip,5,"YES!  All of these!

Crime and Punishment is so good at describing internal thought processes, I got lost in the book and my heart was pounding when Raskolnikov is doing the crime.  I can't think of another book that raised my blood pressure like that.   I almost felt like I'd done it and needed to go turn myself in.  

Get the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations, they're the best! 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard\_Pevear\_and\_Larissa\_Volokhonsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pevear_and_Larissa_Volokhonsky)"
829,dm6aip,4,I just started this! It’s been on my list for a long time and I figured October is a great month to give it a try
830,dm6aip,4,My absolute favorite book of all time!
831,dm6aip,9,"Surprised I had to go this far down to see Twain. He’s one of the most accessible classics to modern readers, IMO. All his narratives are fun to read."
832,dm6aip,3,Twenty years after (later?) by his son is also excellent and D’artagnan and the boys are back...
833,dm6aip,5,"How committed are you?  Paradise lost by John Milton is nothing short of incredible.  The pure power of the English language unleashed.  Likewise with Dante’s Inferno, albeit in Italian.  Anything Poe is guaranteed to creep you the fuck out, and likewise Mark Twain never wrote anything but good stuff, although he’ll make you laugh not shiver.  Dracula by Bram Stoker is great, too, and his only book."
834,dm6aip,5,The tragedy of puddin head wilson is delightful!
835,dm6aip,3,Adding support for Treasure Island!
836,dm6aip,3,"Alice in Wonderland is one of my all time favorite books - it has totally withstood the test of time! Doesn’t read “old-timey” either, imo."
837,dm6aip,3,Upvoted for Chekhov.
838,dm6aip,9,Sometimes you read an older book and the humor just kind of loses something across the years. Don Quixote is *not* one of those books. Had me giggling the whole way through.
839,dm6aip,5,"I bet you may like Call of the Wild by Jack London. 

Or, if you don’t mind lots of descriptions of wilderness and trees, My First Summer in Sierra by John Muir. 

There also lots of adventure novels and nonfiction/journal type of books on Project Gutenberg. And, since they’re old and out of copyright they’re free. 

There was also a book about a man journeying on the Silk Road as a trader and it was a non fiction journal style. He has lots of misadventures but I can’t remember the name. It’s not that well known of a book. I’ll update this comment if I do remember. 

Maybe another redditor would know?"
840,dm6aip,3,"Yes! I read through all of the suggestions on this thread and there are some great ones but I think Twain, and H Finn in particular, is the most readable.

It is still a page turner and the “oldness” disappears very quickly."
841,dm6aip,3,I'm currently reading The Woman  in White by Wilkie Collins. Published 1860. It is credited as being the first psychological thriller.
842,dm6aip,3,Tolkien's translation of Beowulf is my favorite!
843,dm6aip,5,Definitely a lot deeper than what I thought the story would be about.
844,dm6aip,3,Persuasion is my favorite
845,dm6aip,4,Middlemarch by George Eliot fucking rocks
846,dm6aip,9,"One of the funniest things I ever read was a tweeted picture of the last page of the book with an addition written in pen that said:

As he drifted away, I could just make out his final words.

""It's okay if you just call me 'Frankenstein' instead of 'Frankenstein's Monster.' I really don't mind.""

The end.

It really pleased the British Literature major in me."
847,dm6aip,3,"I second Brothers Karamozov - it’s a thriller, a page turner and it will change your life"
848,dm6aip,3,How so?
849,dm6aip,7,"The time at which they were written. There was revolution going on in France. And we have Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, and others were capturing and capitalizing on the fear the people of England held that revolution would overthrow the crown at home as well."
850,dm6aip,3,"r/dostoevsky has a Crime and Punishment book club happening right now, might make it a little easier to get through."
851,dm6aip,3,That’s so interesting! I never saw those undertones in my readings of it. I’m going to keep that in mind for the next read through!
852,dm6aip,3,"Shelley and her social circle were writing after Napoleon and the revolution had been defeated, and Shelley herself was more progressive than the average Briton due to her radical parents. Only reason they could travel to Geneva was because England and France were no longer at war. A lot of confusion comes from the changes made in the 1831 republication, which were more cynical and downbeat. There was conservative backlash against the book, but more against it's relationship with evolution and secular theories of biology than anything to do with European politics."
853,dm6aip,4,You def should especially if it’s Middlemarch.
854,dm8xp9,5,Just different perspectives and stuff. It's my own little hobby
855,dm8xp9,3,"Here is a [Goodreads list](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/91823.Trans_Books_by_Trans_Authors) of trans books by trans authors. 

Here are a few I've read and really enjoyed:

EE Ottoman - lgbtq+ romance. [The Doctor's Discretion](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35673510) is an exciting historical adventure romance with a trans protagonist. I've liked all his books very much, but this one probably has the best plot.

Sarah Gailey - SFF. [American Hippo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36152812-american-hippo) is a heist story about a band of hippo-riding cowboys, so much fun. [The Fisher of Bones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36292847-the-fisher-of-bones) is a shorter work by them and I think it's free to read online. Grim post-apocalyptic story.

Jordan L. Hawk - lgbtq+ paranormal romance. [Whyborne &amp; Griffin](https://www.goodreads.com/series/92735-whyborne-griffin) is Lovecraftian historical gay romance (it's my favorite series).

Meredith Russo - YA contemporary fiction. [If I Was Your Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156987-if-i-was-your-girl) is a coming-of-age story about a young trans woman starting over at a new school. This is a compelling read &amp; I think it might become a YA classic someday.

---

A few other authors I have not read yet (these are all SFF): Yoon Ha Lee ([Ninefox Gambit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26118426-ninefox-gambit)), Charlie Jane Anders ([City in the Middle of the Night](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37534907-the-city-in-the-middle-of-the-night)), J.Y. Yang ([Tensorate series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/198015-tensorate))"
856,dm8xp9,4,"Would non binary count for you? I'd check out Akwaeke Emezi. I LOVED their debut novel Freshwater which is about a girl (sometimes) that lives with gods in her head. Her YA book Pet was enjoyable as well. Jam lives in a world where ""Angels"" have driven out all the ""Monsters"" but a mysterious hunter arrives claiming monsters are still around and endangering her friend. It's not as good as Freshwater, but worth reading I think. I'm excited for whatever Emezi does next."
857,dm8xp9,3,"These are nonfiction, but: Alex Iantaffi, Meg-Jon Barker, Juno Roche, Julia Serano, Susan Stryker, Jack Halberstam, Clare Sears, S. Bear Bergman, Kate Bornstein, Ivan Coyote, CN Lester...

I enjoy all of them because they are either historical or commentary on social events, or autobiographical."
858,dm8xp9,3,"I recently read a book called Fierce Femmes and Notorious Liars by Kai Cheng Thom. It isn’t really an autobiography but it’s written like one. I really enjoyed the aesthetic choices the author uses. However, I wouldn’t recommend the audiobook because the narration detracted from the experience.

Edit: words."
859,dm8xp9,3,"No problem! Just heads up it's a darker read. Self- harm and that kind of thing, if you're sensitive. Happy reading!"
860,dmf65f,3,PETER
861,dmf65f,3,"Johnny got his gun
Helter Skelter
Both not considered horror in the traditional sense but the will both give you that unease which good horror can also give you."
862,dmf65f,3,"I personally love anything by Darcey Coates, they are all pretty psychological."
863,dmf65f,3,Geralds Game- Stephen King. I did not know what I signed up for when I gave that one a go.
864,dmf65f,3,Atmospheric and creepy. Had a great building sense of dread.
865,dmf65f,6,"Lehane's Mystic River just broke me for a few weeks after reading.  I guess I wouldn't classify it as horror, but it's so brutal, and such a plausible brutality"
866,dmf65f,3,"I think A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay fits this. I absolutely loved it, had a hard time putting it down. Also Bird Box was a much better book than movie"
867,dmf65f,3,Rats in the Walls is another good starting point. Lovecraft can get wordy. RitW is pretty short and to the point.
868,dmf65f,3,"Me, too.  I was so disappointed, because I'd loved the rest of the book."
869,dmf65f,7,"Well, not just anything by LOVECRAFT. I’m a big HPL fan, but he did write a lot of bad stories. Go for the good stuff first and dig deeper if you dig it.
Start with “Shadow over Innsmouth” or “The Call of Cthulhu”  for two of his best classic stories.
“The Picture in the House” is a quick, but terrifying read. “Herbert West-Reanimator” is gruesome, but hysterical at the same time."
870,dmf65f,3,"Respectfully disagree about “Mountains” for a new HPL reader. Way too long and convoluted for a first story. Definitely a mandatory read as an important part of Cthulhu mythos, but ease into it. Same thing with “Dreamquest of Unknown Kaddath”. Read it, but much later. 
Try “Dunwich Horror” or “Dreams in the Witchouse” first."
871,dmf65f,3,Same here! I enjoyed the back and forth and recanting of the protagonists depression. I assumed it was gonna be a slasher story with a protagonist that was suicidal and I thought that would be a cool twist. No. I got whatever the fuck that was.
872,dmm03c,3,everything by Edgar Rice Burroughs
873,dmm03c,3,I never had that kind of feeling before :/
874,dmm03c,5,Harry Potter. They keep releasing new editions.
875,dmm03c,4,If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler by Italo Calvino... if only to give copies to my friends and see if they love it as much as I do.
876,dmm03c,4,Wuthering Heights
877,dmm03c,3,Stephen King’s It. Especially if it’s a different cover than the ones I already have!
878,dmm03c,3,"ASOIAF, The Republic, Moby Dick, Harry Potter, LOTR, any good classic, yeah quite a lot of them"
879,dmm03c,3,I collect copies of Wuthering Heights. I must have around 10 or so all with different covers
880,dmm03c,4,The entire Dark Tower series by Stephen King
881,dmm03c,8,"The Little Prince. I have liberally handed that out to anyone who is remotely close to me.

And Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies. I am way more careful with who I give that book to because it takes a chunk out of you."
882,dmm03c,6,YEAH BUT WHERE IS BOOK THREE &lt;weeps&gt;
883,dmm03c,5,Yes. I'm currently buying those beautiful large illustrated ones as my daughter and I read them.
884,dmm03c,4,I feel like you’re just asking to see who will say “Catcher In The Rye.” So that you can hold him until the police arrive.
885,dmm03c,3,"""Lamb"" by Christopher Moore"
886,dmqhn4,3,"I recommend Robin McKinley. She wrote a couple of well known books for children; however, I think her books for adults are where she really shines. She has written several fairy tale retellings, but my favorite is Sunshine. The setting is a present-day-ish, recently post-apocalypse world that has both magic and technology. The protagonist is female; there is very little romance. None of McKinley's other books are quite like Sunshine, but I think all of her books have female protagonists, and most are pretty badass too."
887,dmscqt,6,"David Mitchell, *Cloud Atlas*.  Six stories, six different eras, all nested.  Characters in one story know about and read the story before it."
888,dmttac,3,"Second this recommendation with a further warning to avoid the sequel ""Hidden Bodies"" like the plague; it was really really bad."
889,dmzi15,3,"Two suggestions. 

1) “Take Back Your Government” by Robert Heinlein. He describes in detail how to do exactly what you asked about, but in a completely open and non-violent way: to gain the hearts and minds of your (actual, literal) neighbors to make change where it does the most good, that is, in your own neighborhood. 

2) “Unintended Consequences”, by Ross. In this fictional history of the 20th Century, a revolution is born because somebody thought it was a good idea to disarm Germany after it lost the First World War, and somebody took that plan to the USA to criminalize, step-by-step, the country’s Gun Culture. 

Bonus Suggestions:

“Don’t Shoot The Bastards (Yet)” - Claire Wolfe 

“101 Things To Do ‘TIL The Revolution” - Claire Wolfe

“Citizen Soldier: a Manual of Community Based Defense” - Robert Bradley"
890,dn1ru5,3,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich
891,dn1ru5,4,"Ivan Denisovitch. It’s a an autobiography in diary entries (if I remember correctly its diary form not novel form, someone correct me if I’m wrong please!) by a political prisoner in a Russian gulag post WWII. It’s pretty rough, but very insightful."
892,dn1ru5,3,"I know this isn't really what you asked for, but have you ever read Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro? The main protagonist is kind of like a prisoner, she isn't in jail but the government does have involvement in the lack of freedom she has. It's also written in a first person narrative with some talking to the readers, kind of like a diary. Again, this isn't really what you asked for lmao, but it's a really good read!"
893,dn1ru5,3,You make it sound totally worth it! Definitely going to check it out! :) Thanks!
894,do1ll5,4,*All You Need is Kill*. Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day
895,do1ll5,3,"*The Count of Monte Cristo -* A guy is betrayed by his friends, then turns into Batman with a penchant for elaborate revenge plots.

*The Hobbit -* Bilbo Baggins, a very proper and well-respected Hobbit who does not go on adventures goes on an adventure."
896,do1ll5,4,"I read a lot of standalones. I don't like series - I want something to end. 

* The Winter Road by Adrian Selby - A middle-aged soldier sets out with a caravan to build a road across her country to increase the viability of inter-settlement trade.
* Dweller by Jeff Strand - A boy becomes friends with a sasquatch in his backyard.
* Sadie by Courtney Summers - A girl goes on a revenge mission to hunt down her step-father whom she believes murdered her younger sister.
* My Best Friend's Exorcism - An 80s-era story about 4 girls influenced by a demon.
* The Library at Mount Char - A man meets a crazy woman in a bar who introduces him to her unusual life. (the blurb on the book kind is just like a discussion of the first few chapters of the book.)
* Random Acts of Senseless Violence by Jack Womack - A family is forced to move to a poor part of town after a financial crisis makes her dad lose his job. Things spiral out of control."
897,do1ll5,6,Ender's Game is not a standalone. In fact there are far too many books in the Enderverse.
898,do39zk,3,I just read Ubik by PKD. Dude.. I don't know anymore. My first science fiction book honestly not used to that type of book. But will definitely be getting more from him. A lot of futuristic tech and during the book he starts going back in time
899,do39zk,3,"The Name of the Wind. It’s even better writing than Red Rising (and I just finished that series for the 3rd time, so I could read Dark Age with a refreshed memory). 

Joe Abercrombie’s The Blade Itself (First Law series) is also excellent."
900,do39zk,3,"If urban fantasy is okay, I highly recommend The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher."
901,do39zk,3,Broken Earth Trilogy by NK Jemisin
902,do39zk,3,True. And its good. But man I find the amount of detail at times overwhelming. I'm dyslexic and don't mind struggling but I need something a dash faster pace.
903,do39zk,4,"I have read various of Larry Niven's Ringworld series multiple times over the years and enjoyed them each time, they are worth checking out.

I'm also a massive Terry Pratchett fan (Discworld series, Long Earth series especially), although he's a different style of writer to the authors you listed :-)"
904,dochdp,3,Came here to second the Kate Daniels series!!
905,dochdp,3,"As much as I like The Name of the Wind, I don't think it's what OP is looking for. It isn't pararomance at all, and it has a decent amount of crime and fighting (but not quite war)."
906,dochdp,3,You would absolutely love Outlander.
907,dochdp,3,Patrick Rothfuss is \*not\* the answer to every book question.  (Neither is Brandon Sanderson.)
908,dochdp,3,All Souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness
909,doh8is,4,"“Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been” I think is the first short story I read in an English class"
910,doh8is,3,"I’d recommend Zombie. It is from the perspective of a serial killer. I haven’t read it for 10+ years, but I thought it was disturbing."
911,dq9g1x,3,That’s kind of the point though. He’s an unreliable narrator who is suffering a mental breakdown over his inability to cope with his brothers death and repressed sexual abuse as a child. It’s not “whining” when it’s justifiable.
912,dqhrif,3,I'm 21 and in University and also have lost my habit of reading. I haven't read the ABC Agatha Christie books but I've been reading some of her other shorter books such as And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express and her writing has helped me get back into reading so I would recommend starting with her works!
913,dqhrif,5,"I think you just need to set a routine for yourself more than finding some magic great book that's going to cure your long term habit.

Set a goal to read for 15 minutes or even less the first moment of free time that you get every day. Prioritize reading just a little bit, whatever you can do, so whenever you start reaching for a youtube video or whatever, you can be in the habit of thinking ""after I read.""   


If you're like me, that first few seconds you'll feel like ""ugh this is supposed to be my time to relax!"" but then as soon as you open the book you're having a blast and maybe even reading way more than you thought."
914,dqjavy,3,I came here to post this comment.
915,dqjavy,3,"Anything by Dostoevsky. I particularly loved Brothers Karamazov and The Idiot.

The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco."
916,dqjavy,3,"I love just about anything he writes, but for your request I’d recommend 11/22/63. I’ve read it and then reread it, then got the audiobook. It is everything you are asking for, I believe"
917,dqjavy,4,"Holy crap. 20 times?!

Ok then you're a good person to ask...  I see that this is the first book published in the lonesome dove series, but the ""third installment""?  Should I read Lonesome Dove and move from there, or read them in a specific order?"
918,dqjavy,3,East of Eden is both lengthy and winding bc it follows multiple generations of a family. Plus the writing is to die for and it hooks you!!
919,dqjavy,3,Same. Absolutely incredible book. Probably my favorite book ever written.
920,dqjavy,3,I agree about Irving! His books are great for getting lost in.
921,dqjavy,5,"I would say go for The Stand by Stephen King. 
You wouldn’t be disappointed"
922,dqjavy,7,The Goldfinch
923,dqjavy,3,The Goldfinch by Donna Tart!
924,dqjavy,5,"I'm lost on 11.22.63 right now, what an awesome story so far!"
925,dqjavy,3,"The Witching Hour - Anne Rice 
Outlander - Diana Gabbledon 
Pillars of the Earth - Ken Follett
Through a Glass Darkly - Karleen Koen 
The Goldfinch - Donna Tart"
926,dqjavy,3,"This one will keep you going. Of course, if anyone starts coughing on the plane at the wrong time, don’t freak out. It’s totally not Captain Tripps, you’ll be fine. 

You might feel more comfortable with a mask and hand sanitizer for that first part."
927,dqjavy,4,"This is actually what I came here to suggest. If you haven’t already read it I would also recommend her first novel, The Secret History."
928,dqjavy,3,I'd like to third this recommendation. Fabulous book.
929,dql2iy,3,Very glad to see Jack Zipes referenced! He does definitely skew towards Western fairy tales but it's still fascinating context.
930,dql2iy,4,"Afanasiev's *Russian Folk Tales* is a major reference that was used by Propp's for his model of the folk tale in *Morphology of the Folktale*. There's a [free but partial translation at archive.org](https://archive.org/details/russianfolktales00afan_0), and a recent and complete one translated by Guterman."
931,dqmpr8,3,Pines by Blake Crouch is where you should start
932,dqmpr8,6,"NIGHT FILM, Marisha Pessl - murder mystery, with occult influences. THE SHADOW YEAR, Jeffrey Ford - detective fic w/ occult overtones.  WOMAN IN THE DUNES, Kobo Abe.  BIRD BOX, Josh Malerman - also his BLACK MAD WHEEL.

The Night Vale novels are good:  WELCOME TO NIGHT VALE, ALICE ISN'T DEAD, and IT DEVOURS! all by Joseph Fink - weird community, strange happenings.  (The Night Vale podcast is good, too.)

HOUSE OF LEAVES, Mark Danielewski - most disturbing book I've ever read.  Requires time and a well-developed attention span. And snacks - you'll be there awhile.

Blake Crouch:  DARK MATTER and his newest, RECURSION.

There's a David Lynch-inspired anthology of stories by top-shelf writers:  IN HEAVEN EVERYTHING IS FINE, ed by Cameron Pierce.

Writers with a Lynchian vibe:  William S. Burroughs. Philip K. Dick.  Kafka."
933,dqptj7,6,"*No gore to speak of - just pure psychological fear:*

HOUSE OF LEAVES, Mark Danielewski - most disturbing book I've ever read. 

Shirley Jackson, both THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE.   Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW.  Peter Straub's GHOST STORY."
934,dqptj7,3,"I'll definitely second House of Leaves.

I recently tried reading the Turn of the Screw. Got about 20 pages in before I decided to just drop it. The prose was just way too much for me. At the time I was kind of hoping for a more simple read. I'll probably try to give it another go at some point."
935,dqptj7,3,"The two are very different. The series was excellent, Mike Flanagan (director) definitely retained the Creeping Insanity feel of the novel   
 \- which is less defined, more ambiguous, leaves open possibilities for your imagination to fill in.  The book is a classic."
936,dqptj7,5,"More without the gore:

REBECCA, by Daphne du Maurier.  As a matter of fact, if you're new to horror, this is a good place to start, lots of suspense, no gore at all.

PENPAL, Dathan Auerbach.  The narrator attempts to reconstruct his past to make sense of unsettling childhood memories - reads like putting together a puzzle, his memories not in chronological order.  The horror just keeps unfolding.

You might like Helen Oyeyemi's WHITE IS FOR WITCHING.  She's a fairly new voice and has a unique writing style.

Josh Malerman's BIRD BOX - you may have seen this on Netflix, but the book is worth a read.  No gore to speak of, maybe just around the edges - you never even see the ""monsters,"" that's kind of the point - but the tension just keeps ratcheting up.  Very edge-of-your-seat.

Another good book for a horror ""newbie"" might be Neil Gaiman's CORALINE.  It's a middle-grade novel but the story is common (and frightening) to all of us.  Coraline, unhappy at home, steps through a door in her house that takes her to another, similiar home.  At first everything is better - but the parents in that strange house don't want her to leave.  Very creepy.  (plus great illustrations)"
937,dqptj7,3,"I'm definitely a classic horror/suspense fan - but my sister likes more modern novels.  She just finished Ruth Ware's new book, THE TURN OF THE KEY, and says it's more or less a modern version of The Turn of the Screw.  So you might find that more accessible."
938,dqtamm,3,"This may or may not be age appropriate, but the only book I've which involves witches would be ""The Witches of St. Petersberg"" by Imogen Edwards-Jones.  It is about 2 real women, Militza and Stana of Montenegro, who are sent to Russia in order to help secure a marriage alliance between the 2 countries.  They manage to become influential with the Tsarina Alex, who has a particular problem that she needs help with.  Frustrated with the limits of science, she has turned to supernatural methods to achieve this.  Militza and Stana are self-professed witches rumored to possess magical powers, and so she implores them for help.

The supernatural elements of the story are played in such a way that it is ambiguous as to whether what is happening is really magic or coincidence.  This is especially true after Rasputin gets involved.  Your enjoyment of the book would hinge on whether or not you enjoy late imperial russia as a setting.  I also wouldn't recommend it to anybody below the age of 18, there are sex scenes with descriptions.  Not overly graphic descriptions, but it is there.  The book is historical fiction, everybody in the book is a real person who actually existed.  To me, that is part of the appeal, not many books are written from the perspective of real-life witches.

940,dqtamm,10,"I'm half way through Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier and it's very witchy in a Gaelic folktale way. 

Uprooted and Spinning Silver both by Naomi Novik are folktale witchy as well. 

Circe by Madeline Miller (the audiobook read by perdita weeks is phenomenal) Greek mythology witchy

These are all more breaking Fae curses and making herbal remedy type witches rather than chanting incantations and wearing black pointy hats.

The Fifth Sacred Thing by Starhawk has future utopia/dystopia witches of the crystal magic/meditation/manifestation variety

Terry Pratchetts books about Tiffany Aching are delightful and funny, if you are into a light hearted read, and there are in fact pointy hats and brooms and familiars and the like. 

The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman, It's a quick witchy read and it's amazing. 

Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Hilarious, witty, brilliant and witchy. A must read as far as I'm concerned.

I did just finish Dark Matters by Blake Crouch and immediately looked up his other stories. Dark matters is very freaky, not so much scarey but will have you looking out your windows."
947,dqtt3d,6,"In my opinion, Joe Hill's novels are mediocre. However, he's an outstanding short story writer, and his collections **20th Century Ghosts** and **Full Throttle** are well worth reading."

959,dqtt3d,3,"Michelle Paver is mostly known for a series of children books. But she has also written some really great adult horror stories.

The two books Thin Air and Dark Matter are similar in their language and general theme. There are some form of ghostly presence haunting a place, nothing new there. What makes them stand out is where the story takes place.

Thin Air is about a climbing trip up Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas, the world's third highest peak. Set in the 1930:s.

Dark Matter is also taking place in the 1930:s. Although this time the story follows scientists on an arctic expedition in Svalbard.

In *Interview with a Vampire*, Anne Rice really does an amazing job of personalizing and humanizing vampires with a depth that I had never seen before. The need to form a family, even when living from the deaths of others, was particularly fascinating. There are many more examples of life (or unlife) as a vampire, but they would give away too much of the story. Living through the ages, watching things change when they do not, and the inherent guilt of how they must survive, all make this an enthralling story of immortality."

979,dr03xu,11,"Not sure if this is what you’re looking for, but The Little Prince and The Alchemist are two lovely little stories that definitely changed my perspective for the better. These are my absolute favorite books and I’ve heard that they’re capable of changing lives. Good luck on your journey to a good book!"
980,dr03xu,5,"Crime and Punishment is an excellent perspective on humans and interraction and comparing ""good"" vs ""bad"" events.

Also any Hemingway, he always writes these detailed picturesque moments that everyone can rekate to and, hopefully, see the beauty in."
981,dr03xu,14,Highly recommend Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
982,dr03xu,7,"It's been a while since I've read it, but Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl speaks to the feelings you're describing. 

I went into a helping profession as well and I understand the sadness and desperation that comes from learning more about the ugly parts of the world. Please remember that the work you have chosen to do is meaningful and necessary. While it will probably seem thankless much of the time, you will be in a position to make a lasting impact on the lives of those you work with. Best of luck on your journey of self-discovery."
983,dr03xu,3,"I really recommend Sapiens too. It's changed my view on humanity, not necessarily in a more optimistic way, but it's helped me understand why people behave the way they do and I found some comfort in that.

Also, I second Radiohead :) ""No Surprises"" is probably one of the most depressing songs about life I've heard, but it's comforted me when nothing cheery could."
984,dr03xu,4,"From what I read, the number of people experiencing depressions such as yours is on the increase, as is suicide, and etc.  But you are, of course, not the first to have such feelings. You are no doubt, in the company of millions across history. Imagine, for example, what it would have been like to live during, or through, the era of Nazism in Germany and Europe.

Your eyes appear to be open now... To the pointlessness of so much, and the self-serving nature of humans. IMO, that's just pretty much the way things are.

I suspect that a greater acquaintance with the philosophy of Buddhism would be of benefit to you. I am not suggesting that you become Buddhist necessarily. Only that you acquaint yourself with the original teachings of the Buddha, his life story, perhaps, the four noble truths, the noble eightfold path, and so forth. 

Studying Buddhism should help you to form something of a sense of detachment, at least. You are but one person. You are not responsible for the way the world is, much less how other people are, nor are you personally responsible for correcting such things. There are things one can do to help minimize suffering, for example, both for yourself and others. The Buddha also has advice on ""the right way to live."" That advice can be helpful at the very least, and it certainly won't harm anyone to become familiar with it. 

Again, I'm not suggesting you somehow ""get religion."" Core Buddhism is simple philosophy. Any Asian Buddhist gods were added later by alleged followers. There are no gods in original Buddhism, and nor was Buddha a god. 

There are tons of books on Buddhism, of course. I would recommend you avoid books that deal with Buddhism specifically as a religion, at least initially. Too, you don't really need to know about Buddhist logic, Buddhist cosmology, meditation, yoga, Zen, Mahayana, and etc at this point.

One book on my Buddhism bookshelf that looks as if it might work for you is ""Ethics in Early Buddhism,"" by Kalupahana. 150 pages or so, with parts 2 and 3 being more important here than the first part.

A much thicker book (500 pages) that's well known is ""The Buddha and his Teachings, by Narada. That one, too, is worth reading. I am a bit concerned, however, that it may include ""too much other stuff,"" and that you might get lost in it, then bored, and put it aside.

Or perhaps a university course in either Buddhism, or history of religions in general, could be helpful. Again, I'm not suggesting you get religion! Of course you can if you want, but I'm a lifelong atheist, in fact. And if you're already religious, then I'm not suggesting you replace one religion with another, either. A great deal of human history, however, is embodied in religious literature, history, teachings, and etc. Studying such things (I prefer at least at arm's length) is generally beneficial.

Good luck to you."

987,dr03xu,6,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson really changed my whole life.
988,dr03xu,3,Same. I went in with low expectations and the book should not be judged by it's title.
989,dr03xu,6,"I recommend looking into Albert Camus and his philosophy of the absurd. The Myth of Sisyphus helped me a lot.

Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl is a good one. He was a psychologist that survived the concentration camps.

Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut is probably my favourite book. Its about a man that survives a war atrocity and travels through time to different periods of his life.

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Who knew a stoic Roman Empire would be so wise?"
990,dr03xu,3,Came here to say this. Completely changed my life.
991,dr03xu,6,"I was gonna say this.

He started his therapies with asking people why haven't they killed themselves yet. And they response would more or less be the meaning of their lives (from my own understanding) 

Powerful question."
992,dr03xu,6,"I don't recommend Man's Search for Meaning, because it leads only to one thing: ""I don't have the right to feel lonely, depressed, sad, etc. cause those people in the concentration camps suffered so much... and I in my situation don't have the right to be depressed.""

I know it is a controversial opinion, but this is how many people try to cope with their feelings and the book. It forces you to compare the book with your own reality to... what? To see that your feelings and problems are nothing compared to those in WWII!?

I guess any book as a remedy for your feelings wont work. What can help is more the focus of your real inner needs. No \*\*\*\*-ism, no philosophy can give you relief. Maybe you are depressed because you started to see the reality / the world how it really is.

Roast me :p"
993,dr03xu,5,"It’s been a while since I’ve read it but I can remember two ideas that stuck with me.

The first is that the universe is meaningless but that doesn’t mean life is not worth living.

The second had something to do with the importance of seriously contemplating suicide, and how it boils down to the question of whether life is worth living. He mentioned the two main answers are yes (in which case the person decides to keep living) and no (in which case they commit suicide). I think he mentioned something about people that answer “no” but choose to keep living anyways but I can’t remember what he said about it. He mentioned how asking that question is the first step to recovery.

I’ve been meaning to reread it soon because I know I had trouble understanding some of his points the first time I read it."
994,dr03xu,4,It's nice knowing others feel the same
995,dr03xu,3,"What??? Man’s Search for Meaning is one of the greatest books ever written! There’s a reason it’s on all those lists. I didn’t for one second think that it was trying to diminish other people’s problems by comparing them to the holocaust. He just talks about how it taught him that attitude the power to control what’s within you can get you through ANYTHING, which is a lesson that hit me hard because it’s so so true. It can get you through a bad day, a breakup or even a concentration camp. It’s a lesson that’s held true for all of time and will continue to."
996,dr03xu,3,I agree. That’s spiritual bypassing. But I didn’t find Book of Joy to be that.
997,dr03xu,3,I clicked on this post specifically to recommend Slaughterhouse 5. One of the best books I have ever read and it really helped me to see certain things in a completely different light. Plus it’s a relatively short and easy read. I now buy copies of it for friends when I think they might need some comfort.
998,dr03xu,3,"Around the time I read Escape From Freedom, i also read The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker and The Tyranny of Choice by Renata Salecl. In combination, these books had a large impact on my thinking."

1000,dr4pmb,5,"*Zombie Fallout*, by Mark Tufo, is a numbered series narrated by Sean Runnette. Quite well done zombie breakout and survival.

There's 11 or so.

---

*The Martian*, by Andy Weir, narrated by R.C. Bray. An astronaut is abandoned on Mars.

---

Anne McCaffrey's *Dragonriders of Pern* starts out with the first novel, *Dragonflight*, as more fantasy (men riding telepathic dragons to protect their world from a space-borne threat) but it adds a bunch more sci-fi stuff once the third book (*The White Dragon*) concludes.

If you read it in the order I originally did back in the 90s - *Dragonflight, Dragonquest, The White Dragon, All the Weyrs of Pern* - then it'll be a decent jump from fantasy to sci-fi.

If read in the [recommended order](http://pern.srellim.org/readorder.htm), *Dragonsdawn* (published 9th, but chronologically first) is the heaviest inclusion of sci-fi until book 15 (*All the Weyrs of Pern*).

*The Ship Who*... series also (mostly) by Anne McCaffrey, starting with *The Ship Who Sang*. In the far future, certain infants born with debilitating diseases/disabilities have their brains implanted into a starship. Third person if I recall.

---

*The Harbinger Trilogy* by Diane Duane, starting with *Starrise at Corrivale*. Set in the failed Star*Drive Alternity-based RPG universe, this third person trilogy features cyborg/bionic implants as well as starships, and galaxy-spanning style soap opera action.

---

*Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline (audio book read by Wil Wheaton) is like a love letter to 80s nostalgia, wrapped in a distopian cyber world.

---

*The Renegade Star* series by J.N. Chaney. Starts with *Renegade Star* and is currently up to twelve books.

A renegade (space smuggler/thief) takes on a passenger with a secret, and through (mis)adventures comes to discover the long-lost cradle of humanity - Earth.  More of a sci-fi bent because it includes spaceships, AI, and terraforming (trying to limit this sentence for spoiler reasons) but not as techno-filled like Trek can be.  Think of it as... Firefly's lost cousin, minus the Old West vibe.

---

Nathan Lowell's *Solar Clipper* series, starting with *Quarter Share*.  Sci-fi that includes a lot of thoughtful ideas and theories about the hows of space travel, but less about engines and weapons and more about breathing and computer systems.

Some of it's a little abstract though, and not tremendously technical. It does delve a bit into the rules/regs of being on a spaceship as well.

It's all first person; the primary series starting with Quarter Share is about a guy who needs to leave his home planet, signs on with a mercantile fleet, and rises through the ranks on-ship.

Ishmael Wang (pronounced Wong) needs to leave his home planet of Neris, and the only way to do so and not cost too much money is to sign on with an outgoing merchant vessel. Quite a lot about life on a starship; not a lot of ""major action/battles"".

It's not overly full of technical jargon (like an episode of Star Trek might be) but it does (occasionally) delve (in many cases, with good reason) into the ""what/why"" of how some space-faring equipment is theorized to function.

In any case, it's filled with a lot of self-discovery and self-improvement."

I can’t say there are any books I loved with a sub-3.4 rating, but Aimee Bender’s *The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake* comes close (3.2 rating)."
1007,dr7wz7,7,I read Laura van den Berg's The Third Hotel and I thought I would find excellent reviews all over goodreads. Nope. 3.25.
1008,dr7wz7,5,"So you're saying I should stay away, then, since I'm definitely one of those who've read the original half a dozen times haha. I can see what you mean, most of the top reviews for that book are definitely from purists, and honestly I've never understood that- I know P&amp;P is one of my favorites so why would I want to pick up a book that might mess with that? To each their own, though!"
1009,dr7wz7,11,Isn't that funny? Like you do a little double take when you see the rating and wonder- are my tastes really that much different than literally everyone else's?
1010,dr7wz7,3,I honestly thought it was going to be regarded as a masterpiece! Hahaha.
1011,dr7wz7,14,"**The Scorpion Rules** by Erin Bow is probably the closest. A 3.41 on Goodreads, I really liked it. The premise sounds like your average dystopian (children of the rulers of the world's countries and kingdoms are held hostage, if you declare war on your neighbor your child's life is forfeit, everyone is watched by computer intelligence that used to be a human man) but I found it to be thoughtful and entertaining. The main character really made the book. A lot of reviews described her and the book itself as flat or boring, but I thought the pace was right and found plenty of tension."
1012,dr7wz7,33,"The Heart Goes Last, by Margaret Atwood.

Boy does Atwood foray into far lighter, yet far more resonant material. Veerying away from heavy-handed dystopia (though there is some of that) the really hear of the novel is about cheating, forgiveness, desire, cruelty, and intense irony. It really resonated with me, and boy do I think every married couple should read it."

1014,dr7wz7,10,"I just read The People That We Hate At The Wedding. I thought it was a fine interesting story. I wouldn’t say I absolutely loved it, but I enjoyed it. It has a rating of 2.83. Everyone says they hate the characters, which they are kinda hateable, but they were still interesting."
1015,dr7wz7,4,Agree
1016,dr7wz7,4,"I normally have the opposite issue where I dislike books that most others love. But looking at GR, the two I noticed were Bowlaway by Elizabeth McCracken (3.18 average) and Sweetbitter by Stephanie Danler (3.28 average). They were both 5 star reads for me."
1017,dr7wz7,5,"Oh snap this isn't the YA subreddit, lol. Well let me amend my answer to include **Zoo City** by Lauren Beukes, which I loved and is rated 3.64. Beukes is elegant and profane in equal measure and I thought this book was excellent. It was like a dark, twisted version of the daemons in The Golden Compass. Violent, unsettling, wildly imaginative, I loved it."
1018,dr7wz7,5,"I totally feel you- there are a ton of books that I despise that have hundreds or even thousands of 5-star reviews. I find this particularly with romance (I'm very picky about toxic relationships and emotional abuse, i.e. I don't think either is sexy :/)"

1022,dr7wz7,11,"I finished this book a few weeks ago and loved it. The reviews were so harsh on goodreads. I thought Leonard’s character was an excellent take on what it’s like to be young, alone, and in the midst of the onset of mental illness."
1023,dr7wz7,65,"I can't think of any off the top of my head, but I can think of lots of highly rated books that were utter shite."

1027,dr7wz7,24,"I think you’ve insulted women, people who read romance, and people who read mystery in just the first three sentences. 

Then you correlated this wacky conclusion you have with best sellers lists, which I find *rarely* have romance on them unless it’s specifically a romance best sellers list.

1029,dr7wz7,9,"While contemplating your question, I am shocked to see Dare Me by Megan Abbott (my favorite book) is at 3.21 on Goodreads! What the fuck?! Well, I guess that's my suggestion..."
1030,dr7wz7,3,"The lowest-rated book on my Goodreads ""favorites"" shelf is 3.52 (River of Teeth by Sarah Gailey). But it got some award nominations, so I know I wasn't alone in liking it. 

Looking at my regular shelf, I see one very kinky book by an author who does not usually write erotica is at 3.36 (I rated it 5). Maybe that's sometimes the explanation: authors going out of their readers' comfort zones. That makes sense, and he probably should've used a new pseudonym or something.

Then some lesbian romances (not erotica) that I really enjoyed have pretty low ratings. But there just are not a lot of people reading those books at all, so a few unhappy readers can bring the average way down. This book, Glove of Satin, Glove of Bone by Rachel White, has an average rating of 3.42 but only 26 ratings overall (I gave it a 4)."
1031,dr7wz7,3,"[The Infinite Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34720060-the-infinite-future) by Tim Wirkus (3.29)

For me brought back a lot of feelings I had when I was kid, and I'd discover a new author and then track down everything they'd ever written, I think if you don't have a fondness for old school pulp scifi it probably won't have the same appeal"
1032,dr7wz7,8,r/notlikeothergirls
1033,dr7wz7,8,"Wow this was fun to look up. Of my 338 read books, less than 10 had a rating of 3.4 or lower....but I didn’t give any of those books above a 3 either."
1034,dr7wz7,24,"*Pride and Prejudice and Zombies* by Seth Grahame-Smith, Jane Austin. 

It's rated 3.29 on Goodreads. I'm probably biased because I love anything *Pride and Prejudice* but I thought it was an awesome adaptation."
1035,dr7wz7,4,I always feel like the women of r/notlikeothergirls and the men of r/menwritingwomen should have a get together.
1036,dr7wz7,6,"Herman Koch’s The Dinner is sittinf at a 3.22 on Goodreads and I genuinelt and supremely enjoyed reading it this summer.

I’m so glad I picked it up without checking goodreads first."
1037,dr7wz7,16,"I have to disagree that a 3.4 is a “terrible” rating. Even by GoodReads’ own standards, a 3 is “ok”."
1038,dr7wz7,4,I loved Dare Me too!  Almost didn't read it because of the low average rating. I'm pretty sure most (if not all?l of her books have low averages on there but I've enjoyed everything I've read of hers so far.
1039,dr7wz7,5,Loved The Marriage Plot!
1040,dr7wz7,11,That's always interesting when you love that one book by an author that deviates from their usual genre/theme!
1041,dr7wz7,3,I can’t think of many books read with bad ratings but I’ve read a few with great rating that really sucked. I hated renegades a lot and I find glowing reviews everywhere for it. It really just reminds you that it really is all up to the person reading it. There is no book everyone will love no matter how good it is. I try not to look at reviews for a book until after I’ve read it as to not taint my opinion. So far it’s worked pretty well for me b
1042,dr7wz7,3,It's a goddamn crime how low of a score that book his has!! All her books are rated waaay too low. She is my favorite contemporary mystery/thriller writer and *Dare Me* being at 3.21 is a condemnation of humanity's tastes lol
1043,dr7wz7,13,Jumper has a 3.9 and deserves a .9 at max
1044,dr7wz7,5,I hated that book so much!  That ending was so off the wall.
1045,dr7wz7,8,"My husband got that book for me for my birthday when it first came out, so I feel you! ♥️"
1046,dr7wz7,4,I am one of the haters on that one. I think it’s mostly because I love Middlesex so much and The Marriage Plot just doesn’t have the same magic.
1047,dr7wz7,6,"I knew someone would probably take exception to this characterization! I'm going by how the people I follow and am friends with rate things, which in reality is very different from the official Goodreads scale. Like most of the people I know would say a 3 is extremely ""meh"" for them I think. I also find that things below a 3.5 often have a goodly number of really low reviews.. I feel like it's more frequent to see a lot of 1- and 2-star reviews once you get below that tipping point. But that's just my general observation!"
1048,dr7wz7,3,I feel like the low rating for The Casual Vacancy can mostly be attributed to it not being Harry Potter and not being written under a pen name
1049,dr7wz7,3,Ha! That made me lol. I loved that book when I was like 12 but I can almost guarantee you I'd feel the same if I read it again now
1050,dr7wz7,5,"""The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" by Melissa Bank only gets a 3.32 on Goodreads.

It's a book of sort of short stories that follows a girl from the age of 13 to her 30s and focuses on how her relationships develop, mainly her relationships with men.  It's funny, serious, and sad.

When I was reading it I felt like it was more about how relationships  change as we get older and how they change us.

One of those books that if the genders of the author and characters had been swapped it would be considered ""literature"", but it gets dismissed as chick lit.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A word"
1051,dr7wz7,6,"yes   
I have a short list composed and I just go with whichever seems most appropriate"
1052,dr7wz7,5,"I couldn't finish it.  Mr Darcy was *lewd* (in his head).

The movie was surprisingly good!"
1053,dr7wz7,3,I thought it was tedious.
1054,dr7wz7,5,"LOTR series, i absolutely despised the writing in that but i do think the story was pretty good"
1055,dr7wz7,3,"Thank you for this little mini review, it really sold me. Added to my TBR! That's so frustrating how something like this is written off and then something like Andrew Sean Greer's Less gets the Pulitzer (sorry for being a hater if anyone loves that book.. I'm honestly just a little salty that it got so much recognition for something that seems pretty run of the mill for quote unquote ""women's literature"" and I've been low-key boycotting it..)"
1056,dr7wz7,3,"I was going through my goodreads and realized most of the books I've loved (that I've remembered to put on Goodreads) tend to have ratings of 3.5 or higher; now I feel too mainstream! That's kinda a silly feeling, I know - like what you like and don't worry about everyone else, haha. I *love* Julius Caesar and it only has a 3.67.... I guess if Shakespeare is getting &lt;4 ratings, you *absolutely* cannot please everyone."
1057,dr7wz7,4,Me too. I truly hated it. I read it six years ago and I still complain about it.
1058,dr7wz7,3,"To put this in context, I went to find the lowest rates thing on my list, and Romeo and Juliet has a 3.7 and Macbeth a 3.89... both are beaten by Dan Brown. I find something wrong with that."
1059,dr7wz7,3,"Yeah, that happens to me.  I gave The Magicians by Lev Grossman 2 stars, which might seem a little harsh except that his book literally pushed me into a depression spiral.  Its raved about in fantasy circles for some reason."
1060,dr7wz7,10,"Dunno why the down votes, I couldn't finish the first book because of the writing and fantasy is my go to"
1061,dr7wz7,3,"Any book assigned in high school is going to have an artificially low rating from teenagers.  I see that you, OP, are one of the idiots who have left The Scarlet Letter with a 3.39, lol."
1062,dr7wz7,10,"I did not understand the Battle of Helm's Deep at all until the movie came out and showed me what I couldn't get from Tolkien's words.

Just because lots of people love it doesn't mean everyone does."
1063,dr7wz7,5,"It was the neverending glib boredom and dissatisfaction the characters all seemed to have with literally everything. There were interesting characters there who seemed to reach into the periphery of the book but then just when they might get some sort of attention we would pan over to the other characters basically drinking themselves into oblivion out of boredom with the magical world around them. God, the whining!"
1064,dr7wz7,3,"Yeah, I felt the pacing was unfortunate for my tastes, and the general character development. It works for a lot of people but I didn't really catch onto it myself. Thanks for responding!"
1065,dssabu,3,"Funny enough, both authors have agreed that The Martian and The Expanse series are set in the same universe.  In one of the Expanse books, they mention a Martian ship called the Mark Watney"
1066,dssabu,3,"I can't believe no one has mentioned this yet. The trilogy that starts with the three body problem by Cixin Liu. 

First book: What would it mean for the human race to come in contact with aliens? It depicts the first contact between a Chinese physicist and an alien race whose interest in Earth is less than benign.

Second book: What are the implications of the Fermi paradox? What would the world look like if we knew earth would be visited by aliens in 4 centuries time?

Third book: I'm actually on it right now, and it's really great so far. If I told you what I know know so far it would spoil the second book. 

Really great. If you liked seveneves then you'll really love these. It's absolutely HARD science but it plays into dimensions and aliens and neutron bombs so it's a bit more fantastical feeling than I'd say Martian felt"
1067,ejad07,4,What genres do you enjoy?
1068,ejad07,3,YA and fantasy mostly 🙂I like romance too but non conventional ones.
1069,ejad07,3,"What's your favorite TV show, or movie? It'd be a good start to find a book similar to something you already like."
1070,ejad07,3,"Hmm...for a good fantasy I always recommend Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. Fantastic book series but it can seem daunting as there are 14 books, but it is well worth a read for fantasy lovers. I'd at least recommend picking up the first book Eye of the World to see if you enjoy it. Also I just started American Gods by Neil Gaiman, which to be honest, I'm not sure what genre it falls under but it is delightfully weird and so freaking strange. I'm like 250 pages in and still do not really know what is going on sometimes."
1071,ejad07,3,"It is like a huge continent with several ""countries"" that have kinds or queens and lords and whatnot, and of course the main characters are from a small village people have barely heard of. I'm not gonna say too much so as not to spoil anything. But what I love the most is the magic system in it. There is a specific ""magic"" that only females can use and one that males use. But that is all I will go into. I'm telling you, if you love fantasy, you will not be able to put it down."
1072,ejad07,3,P.S. they are also making it a show on Amazon Prime so now is the perfect chance to read the series.
1073,ejad07,3,There is a lot more to the magic system but I didn't want to give anything away. There is nothing better than reading something and being like.....omg.
1074,ejad07,8,"Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson is what got me back into reading after my big slump. Interesting magic system, start of a trilogy if you like it (there are 3 more books in the same world maybe 400 years after the events in the trilogy, if you wind up liking those as well)."
1075,ejelba,6,"My first associations are ""*The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr* *together with a fragmentary Biography of Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler on Random Sheets of Waste Paper*"" (1822) by E. T. A. Hoffmann,  and [*""The Ball and the Cross""*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5265) (1909) by G.K. Chesterton."
1076,ejelba,94,"Howl's Moving Castle is actually based on the book by the same name. It's different than the movie, but not sure I would call it epic. It certainly has all the whimsy if the movie though."
1077,ejelba,161,"Maybe try some of the books that the films are based on?

IIRC Kiki, Arriety, Howl and Earthsea are all based on books."
1078,ejelba,19,"[Brave Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123557) by Miyuki Miyabe (Translated) — A quiet, young boy finds his destiny in a world of fantasy. 

[The 13 1⁄2 Lives of Captain Bluebear ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62032) by Walter Moers (*The Zamonia Series*) — Captain Bluebear tells the story of his first 13 1/2 lives on the mysterious continent of Zamonia, where intelligence is an infectious disease, water flows uphill, and dangers lie in wait for him around every corner."
1079,ejelba,3,There are lots of related mangas which would probably be the best place to start.
1080,ejelba,144,"Neil Gaiman’s books give me a similar feel in terms of imagination. I’d suggest The Ocean at the End of the Lane or Neverwhere would be good places to start. 

You also mention Lord of the Rings, which is great and definitely recommend, but the Hobbit might be just what you’re looking for."
1081,ejelba,5,"""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is actually based on a children's novel..."
1082,ejelba,31,"Erin Morgenstern and Catherynne Valente are the authors that spring to mind. Both of them write with a numinous and lyrical feel that's similar to the Ghibli films. 

Morgenstern only has two books, but Valente has a much bigger back catalog. Of Valente's work, I'd go for the Fairyland books if you're looking for a *Kiki/Spirited Away* tone, the ""Orphan's Tales"" duology or *Radiance* for a *Howl* tone, and *Palimpsest* if you want a very adult fantasy. Plus she has a bunch of other books and novellas that I can't really classify on a Ghibli scale at the moment."
1083,ejelba,22,"Thanks really nice !! I stayed clear of Gaiman until now because I thought he was very close to Terry Pratchett, and while I love PRatchett I Can only read one of his books in a year because they are not adult or gritty enough for me, a little too dispassionate. But Ill check out Gaiman, thanks a lot !"
1084,ejelba,6,The Night Tiger by Yangsze Choo. I loved this book and I remember actually thinking that this made me feel like I was in a Ghibli film. It's set in 1930s Malaysia so it's a historical fiction with lots of magical realism. There's literally scenes in the book that involves a train located in limbo that takes souls to the afterlife.
1085,ejelba,40,"Gaiman would be perfect for you then! His worlds are like dark fairy tales, gritty and adult,  yet still beautiful and with plenty of whimsy and magic. I second Neverwhere and The Ocean at the End of the Lane,  but you could start with any of his short story collections to dip a toe into and see if you like the waters; try Fragile Things."
1086,ejelba,78,"Ah, finally! The question I've been waiting for! A Face Like Glass by Frances Hardinge. I always describe it as ""Miyazaki on paper."" I really hope you get to read this reply. Yes, I know. You're welcome."
1087,ejelba,6,"howl's moving castle is a book.

if you like the way they show emotion, there's also ""goodnight mr tom""

""the secret life of bees"""
1088,ejelba,65,"Haruki Murakami! 

This is what you’re looking for. 
“Kafka by the Shore” is a good place to start. 

Edit: a colon randomly sneaked in."
1089,ejelba,4,The Cake Tree in the Ruins is a great collection of stories. It's by Akiyuki Nosaka who wrote the book Grave of the Fireflies. The stories are short but I can see each one becoming a Ghibli film staple.
1090,ejelba,4,I’m excited to read this!
1091,ejelba,7,"Try gods of jade and shadow by Silvia Garcia-Moreno, pretty new book I think, it has a lot of Mexican mythology and goes on a journey that reminded me of ghibli"
1092,ejelba,13,"The moomin books by Tove Jansson or Astrid Lingren' ""Ronja the Robber's Daughter"". Which reminds me of Moninoke Hime."
1093,ejelba,5,Try Patricia Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles.
1094,ejelba,5,"How's moving castle the book is great, and I just picked up the sequel. I just finished the second Earthsea book, which is also great, and Miyazaki (and Gaiman) were both influenced by Le Guins Earthsea. Speaking of Gaiman, I just finished Stardust which was amazing, (neverwhere was good too, but Stardust has airships, so...)"
1095,ejelba,23,"Is this based on “Good Omens”? Its tone is definitely more Pratchett (which is great), but Gaiman certainly gets a lot darker on his own.

Gaiman’s “Stardust” might hit this craving for you. And if it doesn’t, it’s (relatively) short enough that you won’t feel like you wasted your time."
1096,ejelba,35,"The book is so good! I think the best way to describe the difference is that the film is as if Howl was telling the story - ooh so magical and glamorous - and the book is as if Sophie is telling it - sassier and a strong narrator. The stories themselves are also different, but I personally love both equally."
1097,ejelba,47,"Arriety is based on The Borrowers series, and I would highly recommend them.  In a similar vein is Hitty, her first hundred years."
1098,ejelba,7,For what it's worth there's a beautiful illustrated edition of Stardust that I highly recommend
1099,ejelba,3,was about to add this too!
1100,ejelba,4,"To follow up on OP, Tolkien's *Silmarillion* is arguably more epic even than the Lord of the Rings. It's a pretty serious work of epic scale. 

Also, for a true epic, there's always the Iliad and the Odyssey. I'd personally recommend the Odyssey first because it's more engaging and less dense. The Iliad is the clear masterwork of the two but I'm not going to pretend like it's an easy read. Within that work there are some of the greatest moments and verse in all of Western literature, but there's also a lot of dense, somewhat tedious passages endemic to ancient works.

The Odyssey itself is also amazing but also definitely more digestible for the modern reader."
1101,ejelba,21,Came here to suggest Gaiman..The Graveyard Book is also a great story that is really underrated. It’s suggested age range is around middle school I think but I actually really enjoyed the dark whimsy without the tone ever getting TOO heavy.
1102,ejelba,6,"Ray Bradbury writes in very picturesque world of rural countryside, soft winds, interesting but sunny landscapes. Very ghibliesque. His books are more modern, however, like Spirited Away, than something like Lord of the Rings, but I would say that Something Wicked this way Comes is an American Spirited Away (darn carnival, beautiful landscapes and vivid images). Also, Ray Bradbury is a genius author who writes the best stories. True literature"
1103,ejelba,11,"I'd never thought about it the way you described (Howl's telling vs. Sophie's telling of the story), but I think you're exactly right. They're both different from each other but still totally fun and whimsical stories."
1104,ejelba,5,"Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett were close friends when they wrote good omens together. Both have fantastic writing, but have different tones, themes and jokes. I would suggest Stardust, Ocean at the End of the Lane and American Gods."
1105,ejelba,5,Love Ghibli and I’d recommend Neil Gaiman. His books are great fantasy but not fluffy fairytales
1106,ejelba,4,"Try Patricia Mckillip.  The Forgotten Beasts of Eld, Od Magic, or the Book of Atrix Wolfe.

Spindle's End by Robin McKinley 

Uprooted by Naomi Novik"
1107,ejelba,5,"Namoi Novik’s two stand-alone novels are perfect little fairytale-like books that would make perfect Ghibli movies. I prefer Spinning Silver, but Uprooted is excellent also. 

The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden is another great choice for a whimsical story."
1108,ejelba,6,The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon
1109,ejelba,7,"Love Diana Wynne-Jones, even as an adult I still reread her books."
1110,ejelba,13,"Nice try :)
I suggest just keeping an open mind, maybe it will make your reading experiences more enjoyable, regardless of which genre.

Edit:
Also - Morgensterns books are not YA.
The night circus is Magical Realism. And The Starless Sea... very hard - magical realism x fantasy maybe. 
And YA is not a bad thing on its own :)"
1111,ejelba,6,Re-reading the Chrestomanci series right now!
1112,ejelba,11,"They’re talking about the whimsical nature of the Ghibli films, I think YA and children’s books are a great place to start. That’s lost sometimes in the serious adult books you might lean towards. Just because you don’t like a book, doesn’t mean someone else won’t. If you don’t like a suggestion, give one of your own."
1113,ejelba,9,"Morgenstern is not YA. 

Valente, as I said in my post, writes in a lot of voices. Comparing the Fairyland books to *Palimpsest* is like comparing *My Neighbor Totoro* to *Grave of the Fireflies*. Studio Ghibli may have produced both movies, but I'm not going to sit a five-year-old down and have them watch GotF. Same with Valente.

Both Valente and Morgenstern both often write in a ""fairy tale style"", which may be the simplicity you're referring to, but a ""simple"" style doesn't preclude a generous substance. If you didn't get that from either author, well, YMMV, and that's why I try to not diss people's suggestions, even if I despise the book."
1114,ejelba,3,Kafka on the shore by haruki murakami
1115,ejelba,5,What’s IIRC?
1116,ejelba,15,If i recall correctly
1117,ejelba,5,"Margo Lanagan has given me Miyazaki vibes in the past, albeit with much more of an adult tone and story. The Brides of Rollrock Island is a dreary, mystical story concerning selkies and a sea witch, and she has several short story collections  

The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake by Aimee Bender - a magical realism tale, whose protagonist can taste the feelings a food was made with.

East by Edith Pattou - a fairy tale retelling of East of the Sun, West of the Moon. Multiple points of view, beautiful writing, strong, nuanced female protagonist. 

The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle is a fantasy classic for good reason; gorgeous, lyrical prose, memorable characters, a world not quite our own. One of my personal favorites &lt;3

The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet by Reif Larson - I gotta be honest, for the first hundred pages, I thought I'd found a new favorite for my shelf. Stunning prose, multi faceted characters, the pages were filled with diagrams and marginalia, the rugged imagery of rural Montana knocked my socks off - and then the rest of the book happened. I cannot begin to describe how beautiful those first hundred pages were, and thus why the rest was such a letdown. Even so, I still have to recommend it - just, stop at the first third.

The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender by Leslie Walton - another slice of magical realism, thisvtime about a girl with wings, but also a larger, family narrative."
1118,ejelba,6,Just bought it based on your rec
1119,ejelba,5,Checkout the novel Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones.
1120,ejelba,3,"What's so nonsensical about either? Genuinely curious, I liked both."
1121,ejelba,6,Why are you so nasty?
1122,ejelba,6,"Well thats... an opinion one could have. Certainly not the only opinion though. Personally I like Gaiman's prose more than Pratchett's. I like them both, but I personally like the feeling I get from Gaiman's writing more. I think he is an amazing storyteller. In fact, his writing feels like storytelling more than anything else.  Like if this were the middle ages than he would be a famous bard who traveled from fire to fire and spun tales for the price of a mug of ale."
1123,ejelba,41,"Dianna Wynne Jones wrote Howl's Moving Castle. It's great. The characters and world are deep and the whole read is magical. I have loved everything I've read by her.

I love Princess Bride, can't remember the author's name, but it's a 4th wall writers perspective and not so magical."
1124,ejelba,3,I came here specifically to recommend Catherynne Valente! I read her short story collection ‘The Melancholy of Mechagirl’ and it was very Miyazaki-esque.
1125,ejelba,5,William Goldberg wrote Princess bride IIRC.
1126,ejelba,7,"Definitely Kafka... Hardboiled Wonderland, Elephant Vanishes (short stories), and Wind-up Bird are similar as well"
1127,ejelba,3,"Excellent series, also love the Dalemark Quartet."
1128,ejelba,6,Grand Theft Skateboard
1129,ejelba,3,Yes! Thanks!
1130,ejelba,3,So glad someone asked this q.
1131,ejelba,3,Deathless by Catherynne Valente is a favorite of mine! Not necessarily Miyazaki-esque but such a wonderful book.
1132,ejelba,4,"Nah maybe the aesthetic but the movie was a botch job and then some. It doesn't really do a good job of nailing the themes and the plot is messy/incoherent at best. Ursula Le Guin has a really nice write up about the film on her site/blog that you should check out. It certainly doesn't feel like the books do (overly simplistic and preachy at certain points, messy at others)"
1133,ejelba,3,The Wind Up Bird Chronicle too!!
1134,ejelba,3,"Thanks for The information. We all have our likes, but we also have to account for the diversity of readers. I guess working in a library makes one attune to that. 🙂"
1135,ejfkvq,6,The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August!!
1136,ejfkvq,7,The Little Prince?
1137,ejfkvq,8,"If you want a classic that is still absolutely loved by contemporary readers, and you want something that will hold your attention, I recommend The Count of Monte Cristo. The length can be a little daunting (you do want the unabridged version), but it is just so good! The movie absolutely does not do justice to the depth of the plot and the intricate character relations."
1138,ejfkvq,5,Ready player one
1139,ejfkvq,4,"If you liked Agatha Christie and pulp fiction as a child you might like grown up serious noir fiction.

Maybe try any of the recent books by Joseph Wambaugh. Probably the greatest living writer of LA Noir.

Hollywood Station is an amazing book."
1140,ejfkvq,4,1984 by George Orwell. It is definitely not difficult to read and it is a good starting point. If you want something more difficult with beautiful writing I would suggest The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.
1141,ejfkvq,3,The chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis is a good start
1142,ejfkvq,5,Maybe reread something you remember really liking as a child. Stephen King certainly holds up well enough for a reread once every 30 years. I’m just thinking maybe a little jumpstart with something familiar might get your reading mojo back.
1143,ejfkvq,4,And then you could catch up on some of King's more recent work? 11/22/63 is probably the one of the most popular ones from the last decade.
1144,ejfkvq,3,"Well then, let's get you some good reads. I started late myself, read tons, but never for fun. Here's some I've enjoyed. Happy Reading!!

The Martian,  Andy Weir (MacGyver gets stranded on Mars)

Dark Matter, Blake Crouch (don't make any plans, you can't put it down)

Flowers for Algernon, Daniel Keyes (bring a hanky)

1984, George Orwell

Childhood's End, Arthur C. Clarke

Ready Player, Ernest Cline (80's nerd porn)

John Dies at the End (slacker comedy/horror)

Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card

Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas (very long, but feels quick &amp; modern. rec. Buss translation, Penguin Classics)

(Bonus: Monte Cristo, in Spaaaace) The Stars My Destination, Alfred Bester

The Once and Future King, T.H. White. (King Arthur, the book Magneto was reading in the X-Men movie. First section is juvenile and the source of Disney's Sword and the Stone, but it goes dark &amp; deep balanced with warmth &amp; humor.)


Side note: When I was trying to pick up the habit (2 yrs ago), I did the Goodreads.com reading challenge. Pick any number, ~12, 20, whatevs, but tracking/visualizing your progress and having some feedback stats is very helpful. New Year is a perfect time to get this show going. 

Also: Consider a Kindle. The ability to instantly start reading any book helped keep me reading, instead of intending to go to the library/store, trying (&amp; forgetting) to remember that great book recommendation, or the worst; getting stuck endlessly reading about reading. I know I wouldn't have picked up the habit without it."

1146,ejgj3r,14,"""Children of Time"" and ""Children of Ruin"" by Adrian Tchaikovsky"
1147,ejgj3r,4,"A Fire Upon the Deep
The book is relatively slow and pondering but quite enjoyable.

Blindsight
Probably most reasonable expectation from a first contact with something completely alien. Hard SF, relatively challenging read."
1148,ejgj3r,9,Wayfarer series by Becky Chambers
1149,ejgj3r,3,"The _Uplift_ series by David Brin.

The _Foreigner_ series by C. J Cherryh.

The _Chanur_ series, also C. J. Cherryh.

Someone already mentioned _Blindsight_. For a similar theme, Karl Schroeder's _Solitaire_ and _Permanence_ both have humans being a relative newcomer on the galactic stage, and most of the older species have so adapted to a technological environment that they have basically abandoned human-style self-awareness as wasteful. At least one simply can't recognize human-scale life as a thing. He also addresses similar themes in _Ventus_ and the _Virga_ series.

_A Fire Upon the Deep_ (mentioned elsewhere without the author) and _A Deepness in the Sky_ by Vernor Vinge have a variety of fundamentally unhuman species. The Tine are individually somewhere between dogs and apes but packs of them are human-level gestalt entities. Skroderiders do not have the ability to easily form long-term memories so they use external storage to deal with fast-living species."
1150,ejgj3r,3,Binti trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor. Ancillary series by Ann Leckie. Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula LeGuin.
1151,ejgj3r,4,Yes. She comes from a traditional culture and goes to the university against her family's wishes.
1152,ejgj3r,3,The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell
1153,ejgj3r,3,I also recommend To Be Taught if Fortunate by Becky Chambers for a bit more of the serious side (do they recognize sentience in each other?).
1154,ejgj3r,4,Perdido Street Station by China Mieville
1155,ejgj3r,3,This book definitely has uniquely alien species and cultures and explored how they relate to each other as well as how humans factor in as a first contact scenario. Good book. Has a sequel I believe.
1156,ejlwo9,27,"For 1984, try We by Yevgeny Zamyatin - it's a Russian dystopian novel from the 1920s.

The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Brontë is less well known / popular than Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë and Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, but I really enjoyed it and think it deserves more attention. It's about a woman who leaves her alcoholic husband and is more realistic / less capital-R Romantic than her sisters' works."
1157,ejlwo9,3,Villette &gt; Jane Eyre
1158,ejlwo9,4,Wow I was thinking about We by Yevgeny Zamyatin as well! Loved that book I personally liked it better that 1984.
1159,ejlwo9,11,I don’t know how underrated it is but Edith Wharton’s House of Mirth is one that comes to mind.
1160,ejlwo9,11,"If you loved Crime and Punishment you’ll probably enjoy Albert Camus’ the Stranger, very similar stuff they’re dealing with, but in a condensed and focused manner. And I’ll second Zamyatin’s We, better than any dystopian novels that came after."
1161,ejlwo9,8,Stoner - John Williams
1162,ejlwo9,4,"Ooh, great suggestion! If OP wants a lesser known Camus work, they could try The Plague."
1163,ejlwo9,3,"Right now I am reading Amadis de Gaula, it is the book of chivalry romance that drove Don Quixote mad."
1164,ejlwo9,4,Me too! I read both in the last couple of years and I think We is much more interesting.
1165,ejlwo9,8,"Maybe Cannery Row by John Steinbeck? None of my teachers (including an English teacher) had ever heard of it, but I thought it was really great. If you want a short novel about planning a birthday party that’s  also surprisingly dark at parts : D"
1166,ejlwo9,4,Perhaps it's more well-known around reading subreddits than we thought. I came here to recommend it too.
1167,ejlwo9,3,I only heard about it when I read the afterword of my edition of 1984. The author compared 1984 with Brave New World and We. I read Brave New World so decided to pick up We as well and loved it.
1168,ejlwo9,4,"**One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel García Márquez - the 100-year-story of a family and the city they built, an unstoppable rain, a touch of magic and the best first lines of any novel you'll ever read (and it was a winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature).

**Dom Casmurro** by Machado de Assis - an insane man tells the story of his downfall: his love and her betrayal. He shifts between moments of clearity and moments of madness, and you, the reader, is left to guess what really happened.

**Lolita** by Vladimir Nabokov - the claims of an unreliable narrator as he tries to justify his crimes to the reader (a jury) by blaming his victim (quite different than what the movies portrait, the original story is a sorrowful fable from the point of view of a pedophile, a true criticism of this behaviour)."
1169,ejlwo9,3,I came here to suggest the Tenant of Wildfell Hall. Glad to see other people like it as much as I do!
1170,ejlwo9,5,"I couldn’t get through Villette, there was *so much* French that I didn’t understand. It felt as though half the book was French, and it wasn’t translated :("
1171,ejlwo9,7,"I’m not sure if these are classics, but these are older books I’ve enjoyed: Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy, Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier, Till We Have Faces by CS Lewis, Katherine by Anya Seton.

Books I haven’t read but should meet your criteria: The Betrothed by Alessandro Manzoni and Silas Marner by George Eliot and  Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf."
1172,ejlwo9,3,Pudding head Wilson by Mark Twain
1173,ejlwo9,5,"I think Jane Austen's *Persuasion* is better than her other more popular stories. 

Also, if you're open to branching out beyond novels the play “The God of Vengeance” was WAY ahead of it's time.  Yankl, a Yiddish brothel owner, tries to redeem his own sinful life by marrying off his daughter Rivkele to a respectable young man. Unbeknownst to Yankl, Rivkele (who is supposedly pure and innocent) has been cavorting with the prostitutes who live underneath her family’s home. More than that-- she has fallen in love with one of the prostitutes, a woman named Manke. 

Some seriously bold stuff for **1907**."
1174,ejlwo9,3,"I love Cannery Row! It's weird your teachers hadn't heard of it. My 8th grade English teacher was a huge Steinbeck fan (lol), and one of our assignments that year was to choose one Steinbeck book to read on our own (we read The Pearl as a class). My teacher loved Cannery Row, so I went with that one. I have read it again since then, though. Later that year we actually had a field trip to Monterey and we visited Cannery Row. Good memories :\]"
1175,ejlwo9,8,"Today, Shirley Jackson is best known for The Haunting at Hill House and the short story, The Lottery. My favorite book by her is We Have Always Lived in the Castle. It's creepy, strange, &amp; great."
1176,ejnajs,18,"I’d suggest Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson. It’s a great introduction into modern fantasy. It is adult, but is often recommended as a bridge series between adult and YA."
1177,ejnajs,5,"Just looked it up on Goodreads and it sounds interesting! A problem I have with fantasy that often pulls me out of the story is overly dramatic/unrealistic sounding dialogue (ex. In Middlegame the antagonist says things like ""you foolish men"" or ""my will is law"" in the setup chapters which is the year 1986), whereas GOT has dialogue that's believable to the time period and flows really well. Does Mistborn have any of those issues?"
1178,ejnajs,3,Not at all! Brandon Sanderson is often “criticized” because his books are written pretty simplistically.
1179,ejnajs,5,"If you liked Scalzi, you might try his book Lock In which is a nice blend of sci-fi and mystery. There's a sequel too.

For fantasy beginners I have a couple I usually like to recommend.

The Gentlemen Bastard series by Scott Lynch - a fun read if you like heists or adventure stories, has some magic but not too dense

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb - more magic/lore heavy, great characters, kind of depressing at times though... This trilogy can stand alone but it's the first in the Realm of the Elderlings series. 

Finally, if you don't want to commit to a series.... I'm sure there are good ones out there but I can't think of any, sorry! :)"
1180,ejnajs,6,"His Dark Materials, Philip Pullman — DO NOT WATCH THE SHOW OR THE MOVIE!! But the book has an incredible alternate reality and lots of great fantasy elements like warrior bears, souls that manifest as animals, a number of items powered by a supernatural element and a really great philosophical standpoint."
1181,ejnajs,6,"So, if you want to start off pretty easy, hit up David Eddings' series. Start with The Belgariad and The Mallorean, then go to The Elenium and the Tamuli. I loved those books. Still do, in fact. 

Also fantastic is Redwall and the associated books by Brian Jacques. Hands down some of the best fantasy I've ever read. There also happen to be a bunch. I'd say start with Redwall, then Mossflower, and then Martin the Warrior. But they're all great. 

You should also pick up and read Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman. The Amazon series is pretty good, and mostly holds up, but the book *is* better. I can't tell you how many times I've bought that book. I've got a three or four stack in my closet in case I give another away. It's just that good. I usually read it at least once a year for the last fifteen years. 

Also in the Christian mythos, but you don't need to be a Christian to enjoy or appreciate, is The Book of Joby. Loosely based on the Book of Job, but mixed with Arthurian legend, it's a one shot story of the wager between God and Lucifer. 

Another take on that mythos, and beautifully written to boot, is Stephen Brust's To Reign In Hell. Forget everything you know about angels and demons, and read about the first days. Seriously, he knows how to turn a phrase.

Although I'm not sure how fantasy it really is, and I suppose it depends on how you view zombies, you should check out World War Z. Don't fuck around with that movie; rolling dumpster fire is too good a descriptor. But the book is incredible. The story it weaves is entrancing. I'd truly love to see a movie or series do that justice. 

I'm sure there are others, but those would serve you well enough, I'm sure. Enjoy."
1182,ejnajs,6,I too enjoy the Gentlemen Bastards.
1183,ejnajs,10,"The Witcher is getting a lot of attention with the new Netflix series, and it's based on the book with the same name (it's also the basis of The Witcher game series, but the plot isn't really related). The problem with it is that it's a translation from Polish, so the writing style is a little clunky. There's a YouTube video of Henry Cavill reading the first chapter as a promotion for the show (he seems to be a legitimate fan of the book and game and super excited about the role), so you can listen and get an idea of if it's a good choice for you."
1184,ejnajs,4,"A Darker Shade of Magic Series by V.E. Schwab - Really fast paced and engaging adult fantasy (although, it's more between YA and adult) with likeable characters and really good world building without the language being too convoluted."
1185,ejnajs,3,"For what it's worth, I felt the same about fantasy as you and only decided to pick up The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson because it's rating on goodreads made me curious. I even gave up during the prologue because it seemed to be everything I feared Epic fantasy would be. Very quickly though it grew on me, and I read all three books in record time. It really is a great series and definitely worth the attempt if you want to broaden your horizons. 

The Mistborn series by the same author is a much easier read but equally as good. The first trilogy in particular is *amazing*.

Another I'd highly recommend is The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie. Very easy to read, very brutal, very funny, just a great story with some excellent world building and characters."
1186,ejnajs,4,"Other than his Stormlight Archives, generally all of his books are easy to read. This is coming from a dyslexic guy that has struggled for years to enjoy reading."
1187,ejnajs,3,"Seconding The Witcher series, by Andrzej Sapkowski! The universe is incredible and immersive. Fascinating character studies, tight dialogue, action, subversive humor which can be genuinely laugh out loud funny at times, and debates on morality and philosophy all set against a dark, high fantasy world.

The first two books are compilations of short stories so they’re very easy to try for size before jumping into the five-part saga. Would highly recommend the audiobooks narrated by Peter Kenny as well!

Reading order is mislabeled on some commerce sites, so I’ve provided it below:

- The Last Wish (Shorts)
- Sword of Destiny (Shorts)
- Blood of Elves
- Time of Contempt
- Baptism of Fire
- Tower of Swallows
- Lady of the Lake
- Season of Storms (Sidequel to the Shorts)"
1188,ejnajs,3,A stand-alone: Howl’s Moving Castle
1189,ejnajs,3,"Tamora Pierce is a good introduction to fantasy. 

Discworld tends to subvert a lot of tropes, but it’s very funny and incredibly easy to get into."
1190,ejnajs,3,SECONDING REDWALL.
1191,ejnajs,5,"If *The Lord of the Rings* was too slow, try *The Hobbit*! It's a pretty short read, but a great story and very well written. It doesn't get bogged down in the details like lotr does at times."
1192,ejnajs,7,I have really enjoyed the Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. Can’t wait for the third book to be released.
1193,ejnajs,5,Harry Potter all the way.
1194,ejncyr,3,"The Elric Saga by Michael Moorcock

1198,ejnmuq,19,Did you read The Lost World too? If not go for it. I think Jurassic Park is better but it’s still a great read.
1199,ejnmuq,3,Gerald's game by Stephen King has that kind of suspense where you don't know what's going to go down
1200,ejnmuq,6,The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey. Not sure if you are willing to dive into a series or not but they keep a good pace throughout.
1201,ejnmuq,4,"- *The Talisman* , by Stephen King
- *The Stand* , by Stephen King"
1202,ejnmuq,3,Raptor Red by Robert T. Bakker
1203,ejnmuq,11,"Read more of Michael Creighton! Particularly 
Timeline-the movie was terrrible but the book is amazing I’ve read it a few times. 
Andromeda Strain - probably one of his best book in my opinion 
The great train robbery- based on true events it actually has a little bit of a oceans 11 feel."
1204,ejnmuq,9,"Sphere and Congo were the ones that really stuck with me, probably because I was way too young to read them and they scared the pants off me. But when I re-read them as an adult, it was more suspense than terror."
1205,ejnmuq,5,Oo no I haven’t!! I didn’t know if I should or not because I didn’t want it to spoil the first one
1206,ejnmuq,5,"Jurassic Park the movie is very loosed based on the novel. Spielberg didn’t want to make a direct adaptation. 

The Lost World is the name of the second movie and the second novel. Again the movie isn’t a direct adaptation of the book and is actually based even less on the novel. 

Jurassic Park 3 and all three Jurassic World films are completely original stories."
1207,ejnmuq,14,Read The Andromeda Strain next. It's also by Crichton.
1208,ejnmuq,3,"Definitely! Congo was another amazing book made into a terrible movie. Disclosure wasn't too bad of a movie but again, a better book. I've never read a Michael Crichton book I didn't love."
1209,ejnmuq,3,I’m currently reading Jurassic Park!! So far so good for me too!
1210,ejnmuq,5,It won’t ruin it. I promise.
1211,ejnmuq,5,"Lost World is totally worth reading, especially if you just finished JP. The story will mean so much more now that you know the literary character of Ian Malcom. Goldblum’s interpretation is genius but Chriton’s version is different and great in it’s own right."
1212,ejog5z,26,"This may sound weird, but some works from **Gabriel García Márquez**. Think quirky, but with a touch of magical.

I'd go with *Of Love and Other Demons* and *Love in the Time of Choler*a for starters."
1213,ejog5z,7,"Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys,  
Jonathan Lethem's Chronic City"
1214,ejog5z,47,"According to this [link](https://www.abebooks.com/stefan-zweig/grand-budapest-hotel.shtml), _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ was based off of a novella called _Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman_ by Stefan Zweig; I’ve read it and I’d say there are clear parallels. 

If you liked _The Royal Tenenbaums_, I’d pick up _Franny and Zooey_ or _Raise High the Roofbeam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction_, both by J. D. Salinger. The Tenenbaum family closely resembles the Glass family, the family that you become pleasantly intimate with from these stories."
1215,ejog5z,15,"This may be a stretch, but hear me out—if you liked _The Darjeeling Limited_, I’d give _The Brothers Karamazov_ a shot. It’s good in its own right, but it also examines the complex relationships between three brothers and their father. Like Anderson’s film, the book is witty and absurd at moments, but strikes a nice balance by having contemplative, somber, and even existential moments."
1216,ejog5z,33,"Pretty much anything by Roald Dahl. In fact a certain movie, about a certain exceptional fox, is based off a certain book by one R.D.

I also love W.A. films because they always make me feel a certain way when watching them. They remind me of the way I used to see the world when I was a young child and I first started reading books at the library. The entire world was there in those pages, but seen through the eyes of someone that can see only the wonder.  What was your favorite? For me it would have to be The Life Aquatic, then Royal Tennenbaums, and then it's a tie between Grand Budapest or Moonrise Kingdom."

1223,ejog5z,5,I think your dead on with the Salinger suggestion. I never noticed the similarities between the two before.
1224,ejog5z,3,Anything Stefan Zweig!
1225,ejog5z,12,The 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared by Jonas Jonasson
1226,ejog5z,3,"Highly recommend **Submarine by Joe Dunthorne** - it’s the coming-of-age story of a quirky, endearingly flawed Welsh teen boy. His precociousness and pretentious voice make for a delightful, really charming narrative IMO."
1227,ejog5z,9,A Series of Unfortunate Events captures a similar tone albeit for a YA audience.
1228,ejog5z,3,Undermajordomo Minor by Patrick deWitt is very Wes Andersonesque.
1229,ejog5z,4,"Catch 22, by Joseph Heller! Its funny, witty, it follows several characters simultaniously to make one story. Reminded me a lot of a wes film"
1230,ejog5z,3,Also Nine Stories by Salinger.
1231,ejog5z,4,"Gotta disagree here. Mind you, I only made it about a quarter of the way through Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, but I didn't get a similar vibe at all.

However, this is of course very subjective."
1232,ejog5z,3,Definitely Kafka on the Shore
1233,ejog5z,3,"My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She’s Sorry by Fredrik Backman might do it! Plus it’s just a really great book.

1240,ejs4p8,3,Divine dungeon series by Dakota krout. Mix between a wuxia/xianxia and a dungeon crawler. The final villain just casually decides to end the world for no other reason than just ending it. He’s rather eccentric like that

1244,ejsoq4,8,"I came here to post that comment, then upvote that suggestion if someone already beat me to it.

The Magicians has commonly been described as ""grownup Harry Potter"". There are three books in the series and a TV adaptation, but the books are far better IMO."
1245,ejsoq4,5,"I really can’t think of the title of the specific short story, but within Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s collection “Someone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory”, there’s a short story about band members who obtain superpowers, but with an odd dynamic— the drunker they are, the more powerful they are. I don’t know if it’s college necessarily, but young adults! And the collection is absolutely amazing too"

1250,ejxh1u,5,"**At The Earth's Core** by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  This is the book that converted me to reading fiction in adulthood.  The best novel I have ever read.  An amazing adventure story from beginning to end. Before reading this book I *never* read fiction, literally before reading it I hadn't read a novel since high school.  The only things I was reading at all really were history and whatever I was being assigned in college and then grad school.  Then I read this book.  As soon as I finished it I went clamoring for the sequel, then the followup and so on.  Until I had completed the entire series.  Then I went looking for other things by the same author, and then I eventually exhausted that resource too.  Then I went looking for things that were similar, and so on and so on and so on.  That was all many years ago.  I've never looked back.  Since then, as it probably goes without saying, I absolutely *always* have a book in my hand, and it's a 9:1 fiction to nonfiction ratio ever since then.  I'm very happy with the changes in my life which that book led me to making.  It remains my all-time favorite novel

**The Land That Time Forgot** by Edgar Rice Burroughs is also an amazing one, and it's a little shorter, you can probably read it all in like one weekend if you have a bit of free time."
1251,ejxh1u,8,"Any of the Harry Potter series 

The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern"
1252,ejxh1u,18,"the hobbit by j.r.r tolkien is timeless. i'll reread it every once in a while, and it always feels like coming home."

1254,ejxh1u,7,Shantaram.  Overwhelmed me.
1255,ejxh1u,3,My all time favorite author; highly suggested OP.
1256,ejxh1u,9,"There's a few that make me feel that way.
Assassin's apprentice - Robin Hobb
About a royal bastard and his life.
The name of the wind - Patrick Rothfuss
You will get lost in the pages of this one, you will feel every every tree every building and my god the music.
The way of kings - Brandon Sanderson
One of the most well written books tahts I've ever had the pleasure to read, the detail is amazon along with the characters and they personalities"
1257,ejxh1u,4,I second this one. Totally consumed me.
1258,ejxh1u,3,"Recently I read “The Painted House” by John Grisham.  This is not my typical book or genre but I got so caught up in it.  

Another book that comes to mind as taking over my life for a while is “A Little Life”.  I’ve read lots of reviews on here confirming that by others, too.

Good luck!"

1262,ejxh1u,9,The shadow of the wind.
1263,ejxh1u,3,"This is a good recommendation. The stories are deep, but the prose is straightforward so it’s easy to get entranced when reading without too much focus."

1270,ejyhlr,5,I’m relatively new to her (only read about 5 or so of her books in the last 18 months) and I started with “and then there were none” which got me hooked. I’m told it’s one of her better/more popular reads.
1271,ejyhlr,4,I really liked **The Man In The Brown Suit** but to start with I'd say **Murder On The Orient Express** and/or **Death On The Nile**
1272,ejyhlr,9,And Then There Were None!
1273,ejyhlr,3,"Endless Night is my favorite, and was also one of her favorites."
1274,ejyhlr,7,Came here to suggest the same! I also really enjoyed A Murder Is Announced.
1275,ejyhlr,3,Thank you! I'm going to go for this one as it seems to be the most popular place to start!
1276,ejyhlr,3,I just recently read Murder on the Orient Express with no prior Christie experience and it was a great whodunit.
1277,ejyhlr,7,"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a great starting point. It isn't very difficult to read or follow, and you get to experience a good story."
1278,ejyhlr,3,Started with her first novel 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles'. Introduces Poirot quite nicely. Incidentally it's based off a real mystery in an Indian hotel and the story was sent to her by post by Ruskin Bond.
1279,ejyhlr,3,"Okay for Agatha Christie, a classic for me is always Death on the Nile. It keeps you on your toes until the very end."
1280,ejz3uk,12,James Herriot’s books are probably my favorite books ever. You can start with ‘All Creatures Great and Small’.
1281,ejz3uk,3,Lucy Cooke’s Truth about Animals (nonfiction).
1282,ejz3uk,3,"Novel-wise the books of Gerald Durrel (My Family and Other Animals and Birds, Beasts, and Relatives) are pretty great. They are stories about his boyhood as an animal-obsessed kid in Greece and consist in equal parts hilarious stories about his insane family and fascinating stories and facts about the animals (especially insects) of Crete."
1283,ejz75r,6,"I read it around that age and loved it, so I'd say it's worth a shot. The story starts with a bit of a mystery (children are going missing and Lyra goes on a journey to find them) so that might hook her into it."
1284,ejz75r,15,"I loved it as a teen! I first read it when I was a lot younger, but I understood more and found more details interesting with each reread as I got older—like it unveiled itself more and more. The series has stayed one of my favourites even into young adulthood."
1285,ejz75r,5,"I loved the first book, was meh about the second, and despised the third. And given that your cousin isn't into fantasy already, no, I don't think the the Dark Materials series is a good introduction.

If you really want to give her a Pullman book, I'd start with the Sally Lockhart books, which are historical thrillers, and likely much more her speed. The first one is *Ruby in the Smoke*.

If you really want to introduce her to fantasy, I'd go for a book that really blends fantasy with mystery. The ones I can think of off the top of my head are:

Glen Cook's Garrett Files (noir PI in a fantasy world)

Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy books (Sherlock Holmes-esque investigator, without magic, in a magical England). Michael Kurland wrote two other books in the series after Garrett's death.

Seanan McGuire's October Daye series (fae private detective solving mysteries in modern-day San Francisco)

Jim Butcher's Dresden Files (wizard/PI deals with magic mysteries in modern-day Chicago)

Terry Pratchett's Watch books, specifically *Guards! Guards!*, *Men at Arms*, and *Feet of Clay*. These three specifically are very much police procedurals set in a fantasy world.

Tanya Huff's Blood books (a PI and a vampire solve mysteries together in 1990s Toronto.)

*The Death of the Necromancer* by Martha Wells. (A straight-up murder mystery set in a fantasy world.)

Honorable mentions go to Charlaine Harris and Laurell K. Hamilton, both of whom start off with straight paranormal mystery series at the beginning, but which go to maybe too much sexytimes for your cousin's family to appreciate. *Especially* Hamilton."
1286,ejz75r,3,Yeah. Its appropriate for kids and can be enjoyed by almost everyone.
1287,ejz75r,3,"Whilst I disagree regarding the Dark Materials series, I do think the recommendation of the Sally Lockhart books is great. Wonderful series, and a genre she should enjoy."
1288,ejz75r,5,"Totally fair! I know my opinion on the books is in the minority on this sub, and only mentioned it because OP was looking for opinions.

(I really enjoyed the Sally Lockhart books, and was sad that I didn't like the Dark Materials books more.)"

1292,ek7n94,4,"If you're willing to branch out into fantasy, take a look at Joe Abercrombie's *First Law* trilogy.  The main characters are at various points hypocritical,  whiny, cynical bastards, but they're not really evil.  That's just how people are.

There are some supernatural aspects, but they don't really dominate or overrun the plot and the fantastic characters."
1293,ekcc5b,5,I could use a book like this too .

I think focusing on yourself really helps. Just try to close your eyes and feel what it is you want in your life right now and maybe in general... And do it. And keep checking if you really like what you’re doing. I think it’s a habit, tbh. So as long as you keep focusing on yourself and as long as you believe you deserve to live like that other people won’t interest you in a disturbing way, just in a nice and healthy one.

I have not read the book, partly because I've already watched quite a few lectures on his youtube channel over the same topics. He's rather controversial, so take that for what it's worth, although I would suggest taking time to check his *unedited* interviews and podcasts out before coming to conclusions.

1323,ekcc5b,25,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson
1324,ekcc5b,3,"I can offer some novels:

Le rouge et le noir by Stendhal, Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, Lost Illusions by Balzac are typical coming of age novels with this problem. One goes chase his dream and the other stays at home living his old life, is the common theme in these books. In Le rouge et le noir the main character keeps comparing himself to Napoleon for example, while some friend labours in a lumber cabin in the woods all the time. 
I think Purity by Jonathan Franzen takes Great Expectations to modern times. 

Seize the Day by Saul Bellow and Death of Salesman by Arthur Miller, The Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann have comparison with parents as a main theme. 

Madame Bovary is typical because she keeps comparing herself to the people she encounters in literature, and wants to change her life because of it. Don Quichot does the same with medieval literature about knights and want to become one, but that is clearly a satire."
1325,ekcc5b,11,Isn’t Reddit social media?
1326,ekcc5b,37,Reddit doesn’t stress me out like Facebook does.  I think it’s because I can choose the subreddits I want to follow.  It’s also feels more anonymous.
1327,ekcc5b,10,"Instead of a book, I recommend a personal philosophy, Stoicism."
1328,ekcc5b,4,AWARENESS! I second this. This book will change the way you view your entire existence. Everyone should read it.
1329,ekcc5b,5,"You may benefit from reading a book on cognitive behavioral theory. The Bible on this topic is the book ""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy"" by David Burns. Alternatively, if you can afford it, it may also be beneficial to speak to a therapist about how you're feeling."
1330,ekcc5b,3,"I was coming to suggest this one. Imho the book is fantastic, and very thorough and detailed, but the lectures and talks to a great job summarizing.  I'm happy someone else also suggested this."
1331,ekcc5b,17,"YES, plus as you mentioned you see what you want to. On subreddits such as the witcher or dragonball or scarystories no one will be boasting about how much money they have or how great their life is and instead you engage in conversations that are generally quite stimulating (minus the hate)"
1332,ekcc5b,6,"It's really not in the same calibre at all compared to insta, twitter, and facebook"
1333,ekcc5b,3,The book called “5 Languages of Love” can help you identify yourself in many areas but also the different types of ways that everyone expresses their feelings. This book made me understand that not everyone is the same and each one of us has a unique way of loving a special someone.

1335,ekcc5b,3,"I recently reread They Both Die At the End and I fell in love with it (didn't finish it the first time bec I didn't like it then). Well, the title gives it away but the book is about US having the power to change our life even if you ONLY have ONE DAY to live. Mateo the main character has lived most his life in his apartment when he REALLY wanted to do so many things until he received a Death Cast call - and so the story goes. I hope that the book will help you see life from a better perspective. We often think we are better being/with this or that instead of just enjoying what is there but we all die at the end.

It really helped me understand what it means to be a human being. It's not a self-help book, more philosophical. It's set as a fictional book, conversations between two characters. They are talking about civilization and how it came to be this way. This book helped me a lot with depression and just not feeling like I was a part of the world in the way that I wanted to be."

1340,ekcc5b,6,"People have already suggested quite a few books, but I’m going to tell you what you really need to hear. Get off social media and for bonus points get a hobby that makes you feel like you have a purpose in life if you don’t already have one (that hobby could even be reading!). Two years ago my New Years resolution was to quit social media, and it changed my life. I left for about 4 months, and in that time I learned to crochet, created a 20x20 ft garden completely from scratch, and read 10 books. I only went back to join in on crochet groups and forums and share the incredible things I had been making. When I went back I deleted everyone who’s Instagram was just a wall of selfies and candids, and now I only follow people on Instagram/Facebook who share creative and/or positive things. I am very happy with my life now and feel no need to compare it to someone else’s. I almost pity people who share nothing but candids and selfies in “cool places.” Their lives seem incredibly boring to me."
1341,ekcc5b,3,The subtle art of not giving a fuck - Mark Manson
1342,ekcc5b,7,"Lots of great suggestions here. Yes, books are great and full of great perspectives. But at some point your going to have to decide to be the person that you are. I'm not sure how old you are but the sooner you accept yourself and yes "" fuck the rest"" the weight will lift. "" Your"" life is only as good and healthy as you make it. Your giving power to things you cannot control. Spend more time living your life and less time watching others. People only post the good parts. Imagine if everyone posted their sad stories...we would delete that real fast. You are YOU and theres no one like you! The sooner you embrace that the better."
1343,ekcc5b,4,Was gonna suggest this too. I think there’s a whole section on comparing yourself to others and what a losing game it is.
1344,ekcc5b,4,"There is a single way through this normal phenomenon. 
Altering your approach to how you engage into the similar behaviors and functions until they are no longer comparable in nature is the successful solution to your endeavor to become the unique individual you understand you are. 

Example;
The goal is to obtain a quantity of 5 

“A” gathers 2 and 3 of something. 
“B” gathers 1/5, 2/5, and 2 of something. 

In this way your categorization is dynamically different and no longer comparable beginning with how the 5 is approached to gather to achieve. The end result is the same but the way to get it is up to you. Getting a little quirky is a good idea. 

#TheSocialEngineer"
1345,ekcc5b,5,"I had the same problem (and still fall into the rabbit hole if comparison sometimes), but here are the thoughts that help me:

- I definitely idealize people I compare myself to. If I investigated their lives and dug deeper, i'd find out that at times they are as miserable as I am -- or worse. For example, they work longer hours than I am, or have more problems in their relationship, etc. It can be anything. I'm not doing it to be happy bc they are miserable, but to help myself realize we all human, have out ups and downs, and at different stages in life, etc.

- there are people who have it way worse than me. I can go on and on listing this I need to be grateful for instead of complaining about what I don't have. Most of the time people skip by this, while in reality this is truly a basis for happiness. 

- I had a ton of ups and downs in my life; and times when it seemed that nothing could possibly get better -- but eventually it got better

- if I keep holding being happy and loving myself until I reach some standard of life -- I will be forever unhappy, and will always be one step behind since as I evolve the standard will also evolve. Instead I decide to be happy and love myself right this moment. 


As for the book, here are the books that help me whenever I feel down. It feels like they make me jump into a completely different state of mind instantly. All of these are short stories, so they work as quick remedies for me.

1353,ekcc5b,9,"Best advice EVER! I deleted my Facebook and Instagram last Friday. My husband did that a year ago and suggested me to do the same; I thought “I’m strong enough for this! I love this c’mon!”. But each day was harder and harder! I’m not in my country nor with my family and friends, so I was constantly comparing everyone’s life with mine, specifically friends that have same background as me (foreigner, new language, new friends, new family if you got married like me)... always asking “why do they seem so happy? Aren’t they homesick?” Also my family doesn’t have much money back in my country so it’s still not real to bring them for a visit; so when seeing other ppl’s families visiting and traveling... there I was comparing myself and feeling failure for not being able to bring my family. 
So since I deleted my social profiles, I’ll be very honest I don’t feel bad lol! I just feel like “I have to see something, read something, do something “ so slowly I’m doing it. Reading the news instead of FB newsfeed! This also brought me here! Hahaha 😆

1357,ekcc5b,5,"# Desiderata

GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as  possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the  spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or  bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than  yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in  your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing  fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full  of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many  persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical  about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as  perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But  do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of  fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a  child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a  right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is  unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you  conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the  noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham,  drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.  Strive to be happy.

1358,ekcc5b,5,"Give a shot at How to Think Like a Roman Emperor by Donald Robertson. Amazing pragmatic presentation on stoic philosophy and background. 

Weave that with Meditations by Marcus Aurelius."
1359,ekcc5b,8,Yes I agree with this recommendation. But I listened to the Audiobook version and found it so helpful.
1360,ekcc5b,3,"The sum is the same. The categorization or identifying method is a personal choice and a example for demonstrative purposes only. 
The point is many will achieve similar goals in life but how one “chalks it up” defines the individual uniquely and unable to compare to others as the methods to achieve them will be categorized differently. 

Let’s take a term that crosses languages commonly for example purposes; “Amore”. 
“Amore” in Italy means something more serious and is taken seriously when used under specific understandings contingent on how it is conveyed than how the song at “The Olive Garden” depicts what “Amore” is. 
In this way individuality is achieved which, in a social engineering term, lends to the unique emotional combination an individual emits telepathically (projection of feeling) which is easily picked up by those that encounter them. 
It is much like if you have two friends and instead of identifying them by name you understand you truly identify them by their unique emotional combination they emit. One friend’s presence feels different that the other. They are always easily discernible from one another. 
This is how universe communication is accomplished via telepathy. A less than a second feeling can take thousands of words to describe and still not get it accurately conveyed. As to where the feeling is instantaneously understood under many different contexts spanning multi layered underlying circumstantial feelings that alter from minute changes in how stimuli feels to a life at that instance etc."
1361,ekcc5b,3,The Humans by Matt Haig is something I'd recommend. It'll really help you realize some stuff and look it on a bigger scale.

1363,ekcc5b,3,"Honestly, I have been struggling with this! I have been trying to purge from Facebook, and I feel a lot happier. I have less to compare, and I can focus on my life. Not to say it's completely gotten rid of my tendancy to compare, but it has had a huge impact on me to lessen Facebook. I'll definitely be reading some of these suggested books as well."
1364,ekcc5b,3,This is a great poem. I think a printout at the mirror would be nice.
1365,ekcc5b,3,No problem! I wish you the best on this journey! We are all in the same boat.
1366,ekcc5b,3,"Great for you! For a few months I have hardly used Facebook. However I have relatives who do on a daily basis, one of who is disappointed if I don't - if she doesn't receive a ""like"" or two (loneliness and social media arent good companions). Funny that I enjoy Twitter, Reddit, and Goodreads because they feel more like ""my"" thing versus akin to a family photo album.

What you wrote about being an avid reader prior to being a social media user is very insightful. I became a much more avid reader when I purchased a Kindle reader and downloaded the Kindle app for my phone; I began to check out library ebooks on a regular basis. I have found that book reading is often cathartic, whereas social media rarely is. I like that for personal reading it's just me and the book; the book has no expectations from me.😊"
1367,ekcc5b,3,"How about books about people who just get on with it and live full lives, independently and without basing their self-worth on how they appear to others? This can be a wide range of genres and book types, real or fiction, doesn't really matter. Just something to get you out of your own head for a while. 

A note: You're already your own person. Sometimes we just need to be reminded that who we are doesn't change value depending on who sees us or not. Good call on turning to books to help with that!

1369,ekcc5b,3,Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk
1370,ekcc5b,3,Not a book but I just listened to a very interesting episode from NPRs Hidden Brain on envy and how it can help us or destroy us. Very interesting in understanding why we compare ourselves to others.
1371,ekcc5b,8,Basically any Brene Brown. Daring Greatly is also excellent.
1372,ekcc5b,8,"I actually found just tailoring your social media following solves this. Unfollowing all those people on Instagram who post about how amazing their life is, and follow the many amazing therapists who are on there!"
1373,ekcc5b,3,"Not a book, but a motto/maxim coined by Teddy Roosevelt. I think about it every couple weeks.

**Comparison is the thief of joy**"
1374,ekcc5b,4,"Hey, I also struggle with the same as you. What I've done is not delete social media (there are just some parts of it that are too useful to me atm), but I stopped following almost every person on Facebook (which is really the only real social media I have, except if you count in snapchat), minus a couple of people and pages that I find gives me something interesting or nice in life. It has really helped. Not ""cured"" my jealously and envy, but it helped.

I also try to use FB as little as possible in general. Instead I maybe read, or watch YouTube if I get that ""urge"" to look at or do something, or if I don't even have energy/the attention span for that, I look at cool pictures on tumblr or pinterest (I never thought pinterest would be good for anything, but when you start searching and pinning the things you like, some really cool stuff comes up. I use it for inspiration for clothing combinations or costume making etc.), or window shop at online thrift shops, just because I love thrift shops so much.

I'm still working on my own issues, but I've found that I need to try to ask myself ""is this what I REALLY want?"", or what does it really mean to be ""successful"" to me? I know I want a comfortable life, but a little excitement, and a chance to be creative and show it to people. But I don't need to be ""the best"" (still struggling a bit to convince myself of that still). I can be ""my best"". And people don't have to think I'm cool all the time."
1375,ekcc5b,3,"Yes, I like this idea. For example, my Instagram feed is all plants/art/craft and a few other interests. Scrolling through is uplifting and beautiful brain-food."
1376,ekcc5b,3,"I also found this to be the case —&gt; KonMari your social media (Does is spark joy? No? Unfollow.). It is also a good first step towards separating yourself from social media (and makes it easier to let go over time instead of cold turkey should that be what you want to do). 

It’s also important to be actively aware of how much time you spend on social media too though.

Most social media isn’t pure poison, it just depends on how you use it. Except Facebook. Obi-Wan said it best: “You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.”"
1377,ekcc5b,3,"Or how casar in Portuguese means to hunt or to marry. The correct meaning is always conveyed without words.

Appreciate your writing and response."
1378,ekcc5b,5,"I was going to comment that you are comparing yourself to an idea about what you think their life is like. Everyone has shit, and you are imagining their life better than it is. This is what this book that was recommended here will also show you. Same same."
1379,ekcc5b,3,"It was quite easy for Marcus not to be bothered comparing himself to others when he's the friggin' emperor though, am I right? I feel like I agree with what stoicism says, but I find it hard to internalise it and actually, genuinely live like that."

The Expanse got a pretty good tv adaptation, so did American gods, and the first few seasons of game of thrones were alright."
1393,fslq84,3,"Shutter Island

The adaptation is pretty dang faithful to the book and the score and flashbacks just introduce a whole nother level of enjoyment. The acting is also all really good."
1394,fslq84,3,"The Road by Cormac McCarthy. A post apocaliptic novel that follows the life of son and father. The movie it' s a good adaptation, but I find the book more enjoyable"
1395,fslq84,8,Silence of the lambs
1396,fslq84,7,"Holes by Louis Sachar

Also, The exorcist is a great book and a great adaptation. I think William Peter Blatty May have written the script or something too."
1397,fslq84,9,"The Martian. While the movie cuts out one of my favorite sections (the dust storm) and adds that whole ridiculous ribbon dancing catch scene, it has a more satisfying ending than the book. The epilogue in the movie was well done and gave a sense of closure the book lacked."
1398,fslq84,5,"Atonement was beautiful, both the book and the movie.

Also, the Hobbit was my favorite book as a child and I absolutely loved the movies, too."
1399,fslq84,5,"No Country For Old Men. Cormac McCarthy may well be a genius, but the Coens give him a serious run for his money. It's one of the few examples where I would rather watch the movie almost every time."

1403,g0d0np,3,Wait until you hit the 300’s. Then it gets so intense you won’t want to sleep at night.
1404,g0d0np,3,"Having read a lot of Murakami by now, I can tell you his writing style never changes. The plots and themes in his books are all very similar, but I think I remember KotS being one that didn't distinguish itself much. If you do try him again, you might try Norwegian Wood if you're into coming-of-age stories or IQ84 if you're into much longer, slightly more complex, and more fantastical stories wherein someone eats a ""simple meal"" every page or two."
1405,g0d0np,3,"Recently completed:

* *Witches Abroad* by Terry Pratchett. I love Pratchett so I'm rereading the Witches sub-series of the Discworld novels. This one wasn't as strong as *Wyrd Sisters* \- it was one of the ones where his endings don't quite live up to all the loose ends and build-up. But it was still a really fun read.
* *We Have No Idea* by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson. Two physicists take you on a tour of all the mysteries in science physicists haven't solved yet. This book had strong positives but also strong negatives for me. On the plus side, it was so fun learning about all the crazy stuff in space science still can't explain. There are fun comics and illustrations to help you understand and keep you smiling while you read. On the downside, I got really angry at how ahistorical and Western-centric this book could be. Calling people ""primitive"" because of their differing technology made the anthropologist in me rage; saying that people did ""zero science"" until the last few hundred years made the medievalist in me rage (I think the House of Wisdom in Baghdad and the Mayan astronomers would have a few things to say about that). I'd still recommend this book because it's really cool to learn about all the crazy stuff like dark matter, dark energy, and the size of the universe, but be aware that these authors have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to world history.

Currently reading:

* *The Manitous* by Basil Johnston. This is a really interesting book by an Ojibwe author about manitous. The word ""spirit"" only begins to cover the meaning of manitou in Ojibwe, but basically the book takes you through different major spirits in the Ojibwe religion. There are familiar ones like the Wendigo, but also less familiar ones to non-Ojibwe readers. I'm particularly enjoying the Ojibwe take on stories I've read before from other cultures, like Sky Woman and the origins of wampum."
1406,g0fu3h,8,"Read fiction. There's no rule book that will help you not be a jerk, but reading fiction, especially fiction from different views can help you build empathy with other people. Read books about people who are not like you, read books BY people who are not like you. Try to imagine how their lived experience has affected them.

Also, your 20. Most people are kinda jerks at 20. Don't be too hard on yourself, identifying that you have a problem and having the will to change is a big deal."
1407,g0j56i,4,"Seconding White Tiger by Adiga. From South Korea, Han Kang's The Vegetarian and Human Acts are also very good. 

For the Philippines, the classic The Woman who had Two Navels (Nick Joaquin) and But For the Lovers (Wilfrido Nolledo)

From India too, Salman Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories (short, light and brilliant) and the famous Midnight's Children."
1408,g0j56i,5,"This is the third time I’ve seen that on this sub, it’s a cranky bunch I guess?"
1409,g0j56i,4,"Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan is a classic, and especially great for American readers since it goes between the mothers stories (which take place in China) and the daughters stories (which take place in the US). 
I also love Nectar in a Sieve by Kamala Markandaya, a beautiful novel that takes place in India during the British colonial period. 
If you’re into graphic novels, read Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi (another classic) that gives insight into Iranian culture that many westerners are unaware of. 
I’d also recommend Under The Same Sky, a memoir by Joseph Kim. He’s a North Korean refugee, and the book is very illuminating about the situation in North Korea. 
If you’re into middle-grade books, Kira-Kira by Cynthia Kadohata is beautiful. I’d also recommend Becoming Naomi Leon by Pam Munoz Ryan."
1410,g0j56i,5,"_Half of a Yellow Sun_ by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a novel that tells the story of the Biafran and African wars through the eyes of several cultures."

""The Fishermen"" by Obioma (Obioma is kind of known as the new Achebe, so check out all of his books)

""The Kite Runner"" by Khaled Hosseini

""Homegoing"" by Yaa Gyasi

I see Adichie mentioned, she's great as well. Jhumpa Lahiri is great too. However, please note a lot of the authors I mentioned are American as well, but are certainly not white are often are writing about not-strictly-American experiences."
1412,g0j56i,3,I second the kite runner!
1413,g0j56i,3,"The Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri, it's a collection of short stories about different experiences of people of all ages in different phases of life and South Asian backgrounds (Pakistani, Indian, Bengali, etc). I'm half way through but so far I've cried twice. It's absolutely beautiful because it talks about so many varied experiences that we don't often hear about from the South Asian subcontinent, especially the interactions between Western born South Asians and native born South Asians."

[A Brief History of Seven Killings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20893314-a-brief-history-of-seven-killings) follows a bunch of different characters’ perspectives, all centered around the attempted murder of Bob Marley, and it is anything but brief at nearly 700 pages.

[In a Dark Wood Wandering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123091.In_a_Dark_Wood_Wandering) is a good piece of historical fiction set in medieval France, and is almost 600 pages long.

[A Place of Greater Safety](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101921.A_Place_of_Greater_Safety) is another good historical fiction book about the people involved in the French Revolution, and it’s just under 750 pages.

[The Luminaries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333230-the-luminaries) is a mystery set in 1800s New Zealand, and is about 850 pages.

[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3985.The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_Clay) is about a pair of cousins who create comics, and is over 600 pages.

[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell) might already be on your list of ~20, but if not it’s worth checking out. Almost 850 pages.

1420,g0qmy6,3,"Infinite Jest by DFW is a great one. Also, Gormenghast by Peake. It was originally published as a trilogy, but it's one big book (published recently by overlook if you don't prefer to read first editions) and probably the greatest book ever written."

1422,g0qmy6,6,"The Gray House by Mariam Petrosyan. It's about a house for disabled children. The house can be a dark, nasty place where people die, but it can also be a source of happiness and enlightenment. The genre is magical realism, and it's an intense read. I had to read it twice to catch all the references and interwoven stories."

The Overstory - Richard Powers (similar theme to Barkskins  actually).

1436,g0wpf8,6,"It would help to know exactly what you liked about the Avatar magic. If you mean a system strictly based on ""the four elements"" I can't help you. If you want a magic system that's creative, logical, and complete, I can.

I would suggest anything by Brandon Sanderson, his magic systems are all balanced and well-thought-out. *Mistborn: The Final Empire* is a great place to start! Its main magic is called allomancy, where you use specific alloys of metals like steel and copper to produce certain effects."
1437,g0wpf8,4,"Not a book, but if you like ATLA you’d probably like The Dragon Prince on netflix. It has a magic system that is based on the elements and the way the system is formed is pretty cool!"
1438,g0wpf8,3,If you’re into YA and romance stories the Air Awakens series has a magic system based on elements and you get your magic based on what region you’re from. So very similar in that sense. But the main character is a girl and it’s got some of those YA romance tropes.
1439,g0wpf8,8,"Shades of Magic by V.E. Schwab. Most magical people can control an element or two, and Antari can control all elements and use blood magic to travel between parallel worlds.

Also post christian apocalypse and has some dirty parts- faith hunter has a trilogy, the 1st one is Seraphs I think, where there are mages from seraphs doing the nasty with humans and they are segregated and have elemental magic and light demons.

1446,g0wpf8,3,"2nd language? I was going to warn that she's a very fast read because it's meant for preteens and teens. The 2nd language thing should be able to keep your wallet happy and enough reading material to get you through the pandemic shut down. Because she has an insane amount of books she's written. Like, a lot. She averages 4 books per series and then will have seperate series set in the same world and sometimes the same timeline so it in effect is like a sequal series? And then another one because she enjoys the world building. She has 2 seperate universes she writes no-one is the Circle of Magic and the other starts with The Song of The Lioness. Like the 1st three star wars movies, then the next three. Just she never puts out a shitty one. If I were to have a little girl or a niece I liked, I would buy every book she's ever written as a present for her 9th birthday with a map in what order to read the series. Her books have strong morals on do what you think is right, work hard in the face of adversity, and sometimes love just doesnt work out."

1457,g100v0,35,"Cloud atlas, an absolute hot mess that is so far up it's own pretentious backside that it can't follow it's own plot.

They were clearly aiming for something that would stand out as a masterpiece of story telling, be talked about in ""film studies"" for years, and have people marveling at the intertwining complexities all coming together.

What they ended up with was six films bashed into one, played by the same actors, that felt like you were watching them whilst flicking the remote. Beautiful, but almost unwatchable.

To answer the original question, the same thing would undoubtedly happen if you tried to translate Katherine Kerr's Deverry cycle books to film. They were a story telling work of genius, wrapping hundreds of years of reincarnations up into a coherent plot, but jumping around the time line to tell the tale.

If you tried to stick to the books, and squash it all into one film, it would be one godawful confusing ride, that you'd absolutely have to take notes (extensive ones) to follow. (Like cloud atlas)"

I watched The Princess Bride before I read the book, but when I read the book I couldn't believe that they had managed to do it.  Of course they made changes - that's what adaptations are - but they were so true to the story and the intent of the book, it's just phenomenal.  I read As You Wish by Cary Elwes, which is about the making of the film, and before they did it so many people had tried - nobody thought it was possible to translate Goldman's book faithfully to the screen until they actually did it."

1495,g100v0,10,"I'll fund your movie, but I only got 10 bucks..."
1496,g100v0,3,Agreed! I hated every second of that film and adored the book!

1498,g100v0,5,"There is way too much for just a 2, hell even 3 hour movie. It would be better off as a mini series. I would honestly love to see it, but I pray that it doesn't become a Last Airbender situation."

1505,g100v0,4,"The first two books were a drag. After that it got a lot better. I think the author had very little writing experience when he started. It's get god, later, I promise."
1506,g100v0,5,"i'd love to see it as well


but it just seems impossible to me, not impossible to make but impossible to make ""well"" and capture what the book tries to portray, like you said maybe a miniseries might be good if executed to perfection, but so much of what made the book great is the metaphorical and biblical sense of doom, you know? the feeling of PURE evil and hate and disregard of life and everything wrong with humanity would be nearly impossible to replicate on screen without completely crossing the line and just being 'too much' for tv, even for directors like david finch or noe, thats assuming its done well, otherwise you'd have some cheesy action film that completely misses the point, or even worse a blood-fest splatter film


how do you even begin to portray the judge on tv lol


i wouldnt touch it with a 12 meter long stick if i were a director lol"

1509,g100v0,13,"Currently re-reading it to add to the extra thrill of our current times.

My theory behind the movie being so terrible is that the movie execs wanted something that would give out a positive military vibe (for recruitment purposes?) and Max Brooks said ""uhhuh you can use the name, but literally nothing else"" in order to communicate to the fans that he took the money and ran because the movie was never going to be a labour of love."
1510,g100v0,3,"*Tristram Shandy*, by Lawrence Sterne.

It was said to be unfilmable until there was an attempt at adaptation in the early 2000s. That film was a lot of fun, but it couldn't capture the madness of the novel.

In fact it was Peter Craven's review of the film that made me go out and read the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
1511,g100v0,7,"I read all the books during the movie hype because I wanted to know what the fuss was about. Why all the books? Why not stop at the first one? Because I was waiting for something bad and horrific to happen to the main characters. A death, a trauma, hell even a slightly troublesome haircut - nothing.

I think Stephanie Meyers true genius lies in the fact that she makes you read four books to experience the plot of one"

1518,g100v0,3,"this was me 2 days ago! Each character has a storyline of their own and it's just extremely hard to keep up with it.

1521,g100v0,97,What last season? GoT got tragically cancelled at S6..
1522,g100v0,3,Same with the Percy Jackson movies. We‘re just gonna pretend all of those horrible movies don‘t exist.

1525,g100v0,3,"Came here to say that, don't have high hopes for that one"
1526,g100v0,3,"For the record, I loved it. But it’s intentionally and frustratingly opaque on first read, which I think turns away a lot of readers. That said, perseverance pays off in spades. The way in which Wolfe writes is almost biblical. The small, seemingly inconsequential details that Severian observes, and the chance encounters with other characters along the way, all weave together at some point in his journey, often bubbling up in unsuspecting and surprising ways. Anyway, I’m personally convinced that Wolfe was a bona fide genius, and his writing shows it. But he’s not everyone’s cup of tea, that’s for sure."
1527,g100v0,5,I think outside of Dune (which I never saw tbf) Lynch's work has been pretty stellar. I've seen 7 of his movies and every episode of Twin Peaks and I very highly rate them all personally.
1528,g100v0,19,"I came here to say The Goldfinch! I loved the book but the plot is too intricate and there are too many characters/settings for a movie to do it justice. 
Haven’t watched the movie because I’ve only heard terrible things haha"

I also fear for Artemis Fowl"
1530,g100v0,4,Same but with Eragon!
1531,g100v0,8,After seeing No Country for Old Men I think *maybe* the Coen brothers could attempt it. Would it do it justice? Doubtful. But I doubt anyone could like you said. But as a massive McCarthy fan I thought No Country was a phenomenal adaptation and so very well cast.
1532,g100v0,5,"I disagree completely, I think it could work as a tv show on streaming service,as long as it's given to a really creative director. Just like how some of the pages in the book are structured weird you could structure the episodes weird."
1533,g100v0,52,It helps that the author of the book wrote the screenplay for the movie.
1534,g100v0,5,"Orson Scott Card was heavily involved in the production of the movie and did his best to keep it true to the book.

You can't really get that level of introspection in a movie format but overall I thought they did a good job, no?

1538,g100v0,12,"I think this is an incorrect answer to the question ""What is an amazing book that should never be made into a movie?""
I think this was such an easy book to get into a script. But they decide to butcher it and go the easy way. But it should be made into a (good) movie."
1539,g100v0,28,"Gonna have to disagree with you on this one. While it was a little confusing up till about episode 3, they managed to work the timeline-jumping in by alluding to events instead. I'd say it was handled pretty well, and for the non-book readers it's a pretty cool moment when you realize that things are happening in different time frames. 

All things considered, I'd say the series managed to hold the narrative up quite well while keeping tension and interest very alive."
1540,g100v0,6,"Percy Jackson, in a series it'll be fine but it doesn't quite work as a movie."
1541,g100v0,3,"Good to hear. I thought the Last Wish was interesting, though the writing/translation wasn’t great. The Sword of Destiny I found a real chore to get through. Is there a book in the series I should be starting with instead? (BTW, Witcher 3 is among my favorite games of all time, so I definitely like the universe and lore.)"

Or like The Dark Tower – I started reading the first book and it was sort of pretty interesting but just not *quite* good enough to keep reading, especially knowing that the entire epic is a damn 4000 page book*shelf* to get through. But if it ever makes it to TV I'm definitely watching it."
1563,g100v0,14,Gardens of the Moon was originally meant to be a movie. Erickson wrote a screenplay and later rewrote it into a book.

As a fan of the book, I have to say not much happened, we mostly love the writing."
1582,g100v0,4,So the book series...
1583,g100v0,4,"Wuthering Heights. I know it’s been adapted a million times but none of those films have delivered. The problem with Wuthering Heights that it is a story told in two parts and each part with their own beginning, middle and end. So it makes trying to adapt the book a tricky endeavor. Most films just adapt the first half and completely ignore the second. The first half of the novel is where all the interesting stuff happens, but second half has all the emotional payoff. It’s like having Infinity War without Endgame, it doesn’t really quite work. That’s why I would be perfectly content if there wasn’t any more adaptations of the book."
1584,g100v0,4,*The Ocean at the End of the Lane*. It's such a personal work and I feel it's best left as a novel.
1585,g100v0,3,"Yeah,  I always thought that one is not the one you can make into the series or movies but as someone said cast looks promising maybe they’ll do good job with script... we can only hope..."
1586,g100v0,9,"I think maybe that’s what I missed from it. I finished the first one and realized that nothing had really happened, and there’s no way he could finish the story in three books moving at this pace. 

Writing was good but I didn’t like the story or characters."
1587,g100v0,13,Then go read it. You have until December
1588,g100v0,3,The Eragon series. It was a great fantasy book series and made into the worst movie EVER.
1589,g100v0,4,The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King. Phenomenal series and HIGHLY disappointing movie.
1590,g100v0,3,"I hope they do a good job, i love that book! I like what Netflix did with Altered Carbon"
1591,g100v0,8,I lost all hope for a third book. I don't get what happened since apparently the story was planned beforehand. But that just means no more insufferable characters *glaring at you Denna*
1592,g100v0,5,"GoT mostly went off the rails because Martin hadn't written an ending, which isn't a problem for WoT. Also the WoT showrunner seems to be a genuine fan of the books. I'm cautiously optimistic."
1593,g100v0,36,"Kinda immaterial there. Salinger's descendants won't allow it to be adapted into anything, anyway."
1594,g100v0,3,After GOT I just think all these epic fantasies will be better as TV shows. Those books are far too long to be a two hour movie.
1595,g100v0,6,No way. Give it to Wes Anderson. Think of the contrast.
1596,g100v0,7,"The book also pulls no punches on how various countries react , and offended a lot of people. That was never going to make it onto the screen correctly."
1597,g100v0,8,"They keep trying to do the Great Gatsby and I will be shocked if they ever make it work. So much of it is introspective and focusing on the glitzy parties completely misses the point. (It's also why ""Gatsby"" is one of my least favorite wedding themes!)"
1598,g100v0,5,The first handful of seasons of game of thrones have given me confidence that if a book series is well adapted and cast it can hold up pretty well compared to the books
1599,g100v0,3,"You are missing out. The first book is the weakest. It gets better as it goes , and one of the books is one of mmy favorites ever ( and I have read a shitload ) and the ending of the series is fucking amazing."

1601,g100v0,3,"The metamorphosis—so much empathy and sympathy for Gregor relies on the fact that we can’t see him and fiction is the only way to transcend the biases we have towards the physical.  

The same argument can be made for Frankenstein.  In Frankenstein and in the metamorphosis, no one sympathizes with the monster except the reader and this is because we are not physically there.  Their bodies are so repulsive that one look will put us into selfish survival mode which is incapable of sympathy.  

I also think Wuthering Heights could not be a movie because it’s story depends heavily on the biases of unreliable narrators which movies can not express as naturally as fiction."
1602,g100v0,12,Have you seen 'Burning'?
1603,g100v0,3,Nope. Heard it was based on a Murakami's short story though
1604,g100v0,3,This was the one book Ursula Le guin wanted made into a movie!  I think a very imaginative and creative director could pull it off.  I’d personally like to see how’d they do it.  But of course it could be a hot mess.
1605,g100v0,3,"The Dragonriders of Pern series. While I would love to see it as a tv series, I don't think anyone would do it justice."
1606,g100v0,3,That was indeed N Korea... but why would hollywood care what they think? Kim Jong Il is not exactly their only target audience member
1607,g100v0,3,"I know two that were, but should never have been made.. Enders Game and Ready Player One... Neither did the book any justice"
1608,g100v0,13,"Well that doesn't always help, writing a screeplay for a movie is very different than writing a book"
1609,g100v0,4,Didn't people say that for the Lotr trilogy and GoT ( which got cancelled after s05 unfortunately)
1610,g100v0,3,"I've been meaning to see it. I didn't realise it was related to Murakami at all but from what I've heard about the movie, it makes sense. I didn't even realise Murakami's work had been adapted but there are quite a few adaptations out there."
1611,g100v0,7,"It would be pretty cool if they managed to cast androgynous people though. They're out there, just not mainstream."
1612,g100v0,5,"The trailer for the movie played one of my favourite songs (Terrible Love by The National) and that was what convinced me to read the book. I loved every second of it. I heard that the movie sucked, but I always had that trailer at the back of my mind and thought it couldn’t be that bad. When it came up as the 99c rental on iTunes I gave it a shot. 


Holy crap. It was bad. The cinematography is brilliant and the actor for young Boris is great, but basically all the other actors are completely wooden. Makes Attack of the Clones look like Oscar-level material. Not to mention how they had to chop apart the plot to squeeze it in. And they pointlessly told the story non-chronologically, which ruined the impact of some later scenes (like Theo’s return to NY) because the audience didn’t have context. It was just bad. Not just disappointing for fans of the book, but literally just a terrible movie."
1613,g100v0,7,I think norwegian wood was made into a movie and if I'm not mistaken it was decent.
1614,g100v0,20,*Aggressively tugs braid*
1615,g100v0,3,"This is interesting. I know people who love the book and love the movie but I haven't come across someone who's experienced both. From what I heard about the people who loved the movie, it was emotional for them but it makes sense to feel it was lacking after reading the book and expecting more. Now I kinda want to read it."
1616,g100v0,3,"the Warriors series. It is marketed for kids, but the series is so violent and graphic that it probably wouldn't be able to have a rating below PG-13. Also we've already tried the talking CGI cats thing...."
1617,g100v0,4,"Its already been made into a movie but it never should have been, The Book Thief"
1618,g100v0,10,It was lukewarm but nonetheless his books are strictly meant for personal consumption. The weirdness and the strangeness can't be translated on a screen for a collective experience
1619,g100v0,5,I agree. Kafka on the shore comes to mind. Talking cats would look silly on the big screen unless it was an animated film maybe but that's the least weird thing in that book.
1620,g100v0,4,*cough* Tom Hooper's Cats *cough*
1621,g100v0,3,Seriously it would feel like a bad trip on cheap weed lmao
1622,g100v0,3,"Oh, it was the book that pushed me to read more, I DEVOURED it. Highly recommend it!!"
1623,g100v0,3,I bought it recently and I’m looking forward to reading it too before the movie comes out.
1624,g100v0,7,"Iirc, Lin Manuel Miranda is in charge of the music for the show, and he stated on twitter that he was trying his best to do justice to the ballads described in the book, to make them truly epic, or something along those lines. And honestly? In Lin Manuel Miranda we trust."
1625,g100v0,28,Good.
1626,g100v0,11,And I won't notice a thing until they mispronounce something differently from how I mispronounce it.
1627,g100v0,3,"I dunno, I think this one could be adapted. I could see it having to be ponderous at times. I think it’d need a French or Algerian or French-Algerian director."
1628,g100v0,3,Was gonna say this. It’d be really difficult to capture all the different moods and introspections without a giant just monologue throughout the entire movie lol.
1629,g100v0,13,Dude its totally pronounced Aiel not Aiel.
1630,g100v0,9,"Marquez never wanted it made for the screen because he hated the idea of his masterpiece being white washed the way Love in the Time of Cholera was. He never intended to sell the rights, his sons did so after his death when they inherited ownership"
1631,g100v0,4,I would love to see an animated version of a 100 years of solitude. If studio Ghibli made it then I think it would be phenomenal.
1632,g100v0,6,The fact that it was on a 99c deal like 2 years after it came out probably gives away how bad it is loool
1633,g100v0,3,I think those people don't have enough sense of adventure ;)
1634,g100v0,16,"It helps more when the writer of the book is also one of the greatest screenwriters who ever lived, with two Oscars already on the mantlepiece."
1635,g100v0,3,Hard disagree. Imagine this one in the hands of the Coen Brothers.
1636,g100v0,7,"It’s definitely a tossup. The good things are that it will be produced by Marquez’s sons, that it will be in Spanish, and shot entirely in his native Columbia.

The bad things are, like you mentioned, that holy God they better do it right. In my mind, it is nearly impossible because of, yeah, characters, but the way chapters bounce back and forth seamlessly between narratives and the shear volume of Stuff that happens. Also the magical realism. My fear is that it will be too mysticized or CGI’d to death."
1637,g100v0,6,Goldfinch would have been a good mini-series too
1638,g100v0,6,I know Tommy Lee Jones has been trying to get a script and funding together to give Blood Meridian a shot. Wouldn't be surprised if he asked the Coens to direct.
1639,g100v0,6,Lol it was only like 2 months after it came out on digital—it hit theatres only last October!!
1640,g100v0,3,"The book was absolutely brilliant! The movie on the other hand...Too many themes and time frames that turn it into a classic ""Time Travel Movie"" onscreen. The book is too multifaceted for that."
1641,g100v0,36,That would be one boring movie. I think the book wouldn’t work as a film just due to how important holdens thoughts are to the story. Unless it had constant narration it wouldn’t work.

1643,g100v0,18,"Plus, it's about an annoying teenager who thinks much too highly of himself. It'd be difficult to faithfully adapt that to the big screen."
1644,g100v0,7,No the question was about amazing books.
1645,g100v0,3,"Yeah, I gotta agree. As much as I love that book, I don't trust Hollywood to accurately represent the story or the characters. It would more than likely be horrible and like you, I'd rather it just not even be attempted."
1646,g100v0,7,"Well even HBO fucked it up so, I don't have much hope for that..."
1647,g100v0,6,"&gt; Marquez himself had some strict demands about it before he died (e.g. only Colombian cast)

Too lazy to google... does that mean dialog will be Spanish (and subtitled English, etc)?  We read it in an upper level university Spanish Language &amp; Literature class and there's such richness there that could be butchered.  Maybe there are good English adaptations out there I guess, never read it in translation."
1648,g100v0,3,Just scrolled down after asking if it will be in Spanish.  I'm so excited but also nervous they'll fuck it.
1649,g100v0,3,Amazon's got a LotR prequel series in the works. It'll be interesting to see how much if any inspiration it takes from the Simarillion
1650,g100v0,3,I had to turn Norwegian Wood off about twenty minutes in. It was so bad compared to the book.
1651,g100v0,4,"Read the book twice, didn’t hate the film... found it just meh."
1652,g100v0,3,"I think someone like David Lynch might have a shot at pulling it off somewhat well, but I agree that they would still probably be better left strictly as books"
1653,g100v0,3,Yeah I was excited when I heard Lin Manuel Miranda was doing the music. I hope he can do justice to the book.
1654,g100v0,5,"I both agree the Card had a stroke of luck with Ender's Game and disagree that his heavy hand in the adaptation wasn't helpful. I think it was still only a 'fine' movie but I do think Card really helped it be the best it reasonably could be given how tough adapting it was. Card's early writing experience was in playwriting. That helped him understand scene-setting and adaptation. And his experience and canniness meant that he held onto the rights for the book for decades and fought producers who wanted to churn out some B-grade garbage, make Ender 16 and give him a love interest. He bailed on selling the rights at least three times (or sold them in a way where he retained veto power, idk specifically) and even gave up on the idea of adapting something that needed so many child actors for years until he saw the 'new' (2003? 2006?) Peter Pan film. He said he was really impressed with the quality of the child actors and believed Ender's Game could be successful. He talks about this stuff at the end of the audio version of one of his books (probably Ender's Game) but it might also be an actual afterword somewhere.

And it was a fine movie! They nabbed Harrison Ford and I thought Asa Butterfield did a nice job (I'm disappointed that he aged out of playing Artemis Fowl while that film was in development hell).

Also, as someone who loves audiobooks, I really appreciate Card for his dedication (according to him, another artifact of his playwriting experience) to making sure there are high quality narrations for all his books. In almost all other ways I disagree with him fundamentally as a person and think nearly all his books from the last decade are forgettable."
1655,g100v0,5,"If there was no concern for bullshit commercialism (the goal shouldn't be to make a summer blockbuster) and they made a miniseries that was verbatim (and I mean verb-fucking-atim) with the books, they could pull it off. 

I think Idris Elba and Matthew McConahay were actually pretty good choices, but the execution was god awful.

And just to clear this out, Idris Elba is great as Roland, I truly believe this. But he also happens to be black. That takes away some of the racial tension with Susannah so there could never have been a follow-up.

To be clear, I don't have a problem with Roland being black per-se. But there is a lot of story built on Susannah's struggle with racial equality, and Roland being black sort of undercuts this. This is just my opinion. I promise I'm not a racist.

On second thought, just before I post this, maybe Roland being black could help propel the racial conversation since his skin color wouldn't have mattered in Gilead. He still wouldn't understand Susannah's struggle. It would take away all the ""honkey ma fa"" stuff though, which is funny (and in a way a bit sad, given the context) if nothing else.

Anyone else have thoughts on this?"
1656,g100v0,4,"Yes, entire sections of lines, jokes, plot, everything come directly from the book.  Some things are a little different, but yes, chunks of it are super direct. But the descriptions of what Goldman cut out?  That's a part of the book.  That's the framing that they changed.  That's what was difficult to adapt."
1657,g100v0,3,"Scene-driven cinematic?  Yes.  Adapts easily to film?  No.  You can't just consider one aspect of the book.  Many people tried before Reiner, if it were easy one of them would have done it.  

Yes, that's my point.  There are a lot of books that are hard to adapt - but that doesn't mean nobody will ever be able to do it well."
1658,g100v0,3,Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson. Amazing series but I have no idea how they'd portray the magic system on screen.
1659,g100v0,5,"It needs to only be a book, if not only for ironic purposes"
1660,g100v0,4,I was about to agree with the idea that its unfilmable but...  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhJOx\_4WSzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhJOx_4WSzg)
1661,g100v0,3,"You know, I came across a tidbit by Stan Lee the other day (on reddit, of course) where he was asked if he would ever consider allowing an Avengers movie. And he said something to the effect of that he’d be open to it, but each character would have to have their own movie, and that it would all come together into Avengers films later (all of which happened after the quote obv) And the first thing I thought was, damn, it would be really sick if they could do that with the Silmarillion. It’s more like a saga, where there are recurrent characters, but it focuses on different characters in the overarching struggle against Morgoth over 1000s of years. I think if they could do a series like the Avengers did, it might be feasible. And I know it will never happen, but it’s really fun to imagine. Otherwise though, totally agree, no way it works as a standalone film or even a trilogy"
1662,g100v0,6,I think the movies have actually completely ruined the culture around the book. So a spectacular achievement on their part.
1663,g100v0,3,"Yeah, the Man in Black is heavily influenced by the Judge. You'd have to really work hard to distinguish them, and I'm not sure you could.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same reason why Gibson's novels, especially *Neuromancer*, are so difficult to adapt. They've been so thoroughly mined for material that you'd have a really hard time making something that felt original."
1664,g100v0,3,"Not to mention it would be incredibly ironic to do so, and completely defeat the purpose"
1665,g100v0,6,Facts. Catcher in the Rye in a terrible book to me tbh.
1666,g100v0,3,"Also, the people they try to cast in the lead for that movie also tend to die of a heart attack soon after they are announced to be a part of the movie. I’m not normally a superstitious person, but that adaptation project has bad mojo around it.

That being said, that book is one of my favorite books of all time."
1667,g100v0,3,Same with something like Half Life 1 and 2. You go back and play it but nothing feels special but it laid the foundation for every first person shooter we have today.

Or if you’re open to video games, Kentucky Route Zero. Very text/story based with a lot of the themes you mentioned."
1710,g1fq9t,61,*Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage* by Haruki Murakami is about growing apart from friends and really fits this quote.
1711,g1fq9t,17,Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro gave me this exact feeling as well. Absolutely beautiful in a very sad way.
1712,g1fq9t,7,The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa

1724,g1fq9t,23,"Not a book but a podcast called The Adventure Zone, a d&amp;d postcast. There's a really hard hitting line that goes

“When someone leaves your life, those exits are not made equal. Some are beautiful and poetic and satisfying. Others are abrupt and unfair. But most are just unremarkable, unintentional, and clumsy.”

It just gives me similar vibes. It's a beautiful podcast. Equal parts funny and emotional. Three brothers and their dad playing together. 

Sorry for not giving a book! But I do hope this might be okay as well"
1725,g1fq9t,11,"Came here to suggest this. Fits OP’s search to a tee. Or, for a more relationship-themed take on the emotion, HM’s highly underrated South of the Border, West of the Sun."

1732,g1fq9t,3,This is a great answer!! This is one of my all time favorite books.
1733,g1fq9t,14,The Kite Runner. I had heard of this book for years but wasn't interested until a friend suggested it. It is a story of two very close childhood friends and their lives growing up in 1970's Afghanistan. A LOT of sad things happen in the book as Russia invades Afghanistan and then later when the Taliban takeover. Ultimately it is a tale of redemption. SPOILER* There is definitely a finite moment when these two boyhood friends unkowingly say goodbye for the last time.
1734,g1fq9t,25,"Not a book suggestion, sorry, but this quote reminds me of a similar one “one day your parents put you down and never picked you back up again”. Which I thought you might appreciate."
1735,g1fq9t,6,"I loved both books, but Ishiguro's Remains of the Day seems to me the closest to OP's request, and is my personal favorite."
1736,g1fq9t,3,"Ah, the McElroys!"
1737,g1fq9t,3,The Lovely Bones and We Were Liars are both books that I cried while and after reading.
1738,g1fq9t,3,The House at Pooh Corner fits all your criteria.
1739,g1fq9t,3,the final sentence for *The Catcher in the Rye* fits this perfectly.
1740,g1fq9t,7,Yes!! This is what I was going to recommend. The entire book reads beautifully and feels like nostalgia.
1741,g1fq9t,6,Where the Crawdads Sing
1742,g1fq9t,9,"The Body, by Stephen King. Watch the movie adaption too, Stand By Me. That one quote always stuck with me somehow, ""I never had any friends later on like I did when I was twelve, Jesus, does anyone?"""
1743,g1fq9t,4,It's my favourite book.
1744,g1fq9t,13,A little life
1745,g1fq9t,5,Came here to say this; a good rec and a great book!
1746,g1fq9t,5,I picked my kids up until their legs got too long! They were really light and I was strong.
1747,g1fq9t,4,Third person to mention it but The Body by Stephen King! It’s a short story in Different Seasons and also has one of the best King movie adaptations in Stand By Me. Made me weirdly nostalgic for things I’ve never even experienced myself
1748,g1fq9t,3,"Well, all I can say is that if you’d like to see him in a better place, the second one is really great. A bunch of short stories/essays more than one long narrative. The first one almost KILLED me. I generally don’t laugh out loud while reading, but I was laughing so hard I was crying."
1749,g1fq9t,13,"I'm on my fifth round of reading the book and holy heck it hits so different. I feel like this sums up how you feel in one quote from the book ""I felt infinite.""

beautiful book with a beautiful story. Gives you laughs and makes you cry at the same time."
1750,g1fq9t,4,The Art Of Racing In The Rain
1751,g1fq9t,10,Enthusiastically seconded
1752,g1fq9t,5,One of my all time favorite books.
1753,g1fq9t,8,I love this book. I reread it every few years and appreciate it all over again.
1754,g1fq9t,4,Came here to mention this. Even though it’s longer than 350 pages. Heartwrenching and beautiful.
1755,g1fq9t,3,"Looking for Alaska by John Green

1756,g1fq9t,3,"That’s good to know, I have on my to read list already so I might bump it up now."
1757,g1fq9t,3,100%. I went to bed weeping when I finished it.
1758,g1fq9t,6,"I’ve heard that a lot of his books also have a studio Ghibli feel to them, would you say that’s the case for this book?"
1759,g1fq9t,10,"I second this. I found the narrator to have the kindest voice, like your grandpa telling you stories from his childhood.

I read it a couple weeks ago and it was absolutely wonderful; it was perfect and everything i needed to take my mind very very far away from the current state of things."
1760,g1fq9t,4,Oof read this book in 7th grade. That was a tough ending.
1761,g1fq9t,11,Damn I remember when I’d fall asleep on the couch and wake up on my bed.
1762,g1fq9t,4,"Great book, loved the movie too."
1763,g1fq9t,14,"It's taken me three years to get through the first third, only to find out the only character I liked in the book so far that wasn't a total drunk, coward, liar, or cheat &gt;!dies in the first act!&lt;"
1764,g1fq9t,7,It makes you taste summer as a child. Magical book.
1765,g1fq9t,3,"Less nostalgic, more tragic in my opinion. Great book."
1766,g1fq9t,4,"The ending of *The Secret History* is redolent of a grand farewell to all the characters in the story.

The narrator of the story is retelling the events from decades into the future, so he's giving you a flash-forward of each character, many with bittersweet destinies after the main story.

Even a stray cat that's mentioned only in one paragraph earlier gets its own little ""Where are they now?"" summary.

The book also does a great job of painting the social ties of friendship, and the positive and negative things that your closest friends do over the course of a year or so. By the time the tale is done, you find a real connection being broken as they go about their lives and grow up separately.

(In an audiovisual medium, I got a very similar sense of nostalgic farewell at the end of the Cowboy Bebop animated series.)"
1767,g1fq9t,5,That finite moment broke me. What a horrific occurrence between “friends”.
1768,g1fq9t,3,"Yes, me too. We were liars was particularly a gut punch, was not anticipating the twist"
1769,g1fq9t,5,"I'm not super familiar with Studio Ghibli so someone else could probably answer better, but it does have a certain whimsy/slice-of-life feel that I belive Ghibli does as well"
1770,g1fq9t,4,I feel like that special Studio Ghibli vibe comes from the way the films include all the little mundane details in life and the way the characters seem genuine and act real. Colorless Tsukuru definitely has that although it’s more serious and mature.
1771,g1fq9t,4,He’s the narrator of the Great Gatsby 🙃
1772,g1fq9t,3,"Yes!!! This is a great book because it reads so differently for people of different ages. As a kid, it was whimsical and soothing. As an adult, it still is those things, but there is a tint of depth that makes you miss being a child and mourn for that part of yourself. But it also just has such deep themes about life!"
1773,g1fq9t,3,A masterpiece. Totally recommended it.
1774,g1fq9t,3,"Dreamcatcher is another King that touches on some of the same notes. The book as a whole has some pacing problems, though."
1775,g1fq9t,3,"I reread *The Secret History* at least once a year. I minored in the classics in college, and it makes me so incredibly nostalgic. To clarify, we didn't murder anyone in my Greek class. A certain god of madness and ecstasy was very important to us, though."
1776,g1fq9t,4,Stephen King just nails this vibe
1777,g1v2ie,10,Hope this isn't too mainstream but Stephen King - On Writing.
1778,g1v2ie,6,You might find Elements of Style by Strunk and White useful.
1779,g1v2ie,3,"Hello, I've just finished my first year of an English and creative writing degree! My advise would be find out what your modules are on, they should be listed on your universities course discription. Then try and read texts linked to the sort of writing you'll be doing, for example my first term module was on poetry and none fiction prose so I read some modern poets who's style I enjoyed and some memoirs that are regarded as particularly moving. Best of luck I hope you enjoy your course."
1780,g1v2ie,3,Definitely this book. And pair it with The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and EB White.
1781,g1vlev,4,"You might like *The Atrocity Archives* by Charles Stross.  It has a similar premise to ""Cabin in the Woods,"" in that secret government agencies are well aware of the reality of Lovecraftian eldrich horrors, and manage a sprawling bureau of civil servants whose job is to keep the Old Ones from being accidentally summoned by clueless humans.  It's also very British.

If you like it, also give China Mieville's *Kraken* a go."
1782,g1vlev,4,John Dies at the End by David Wong (trilogy)
1783,g1vlev,5,Seconding Meddling Kids. Great book.
1784,g1vlev,3,14 by Peter Clines is a fun one.
1785,g1vlev,3,"I've read it - it kind of is a little like Scooby Doo, but...with a little more horror.  It actually takes place about ten years after the kids' big mystery solve and, ooh boy, life hit them hard.

But they go back and kind of pick up on the mystery because it was either coming back or it came up that it wasn't really resolved.

I read it in 2018, so I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details.  It is good, though!"
1786,g1wxkf,7,I'm a fan of Brian Jacques brief series Castaways of the Flying Dutchman. It doesnt spend all its time with the piratey stuff though but is a fun take on the mythology.
1787,g1wxkf,4,"The absurdist version by Tom Holt, [Flying Dutch](https://www.amazon.com/Flying-Dutch-Tom-Holt/dp/044124193X), might not be exactly what you were hoping for, but it's very much worth your time."
1788,g1y1aa,6,"Maybe check out Kindred by Octavia Butler. It's got some sci-fi, but it's also historical, but I didn't find it to be slow at all."
1789,g1y1aa,13,"Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood is great dystopian sci-fi. 

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers - fantastic contemporary fiction."
1790,g1y1aa,9,Completely outside your comfort zone would be Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel (slow paced fantasy historical fiction) but something that would only be a little out of it (fantasy but YA and good pacing) is Caraval by Stephanie Garber.
1791,g1y1aa,4,"It's a story about a woman who has a dream that leads her to stop eating meat. The decision affects all aspects of her life to the point of losing her sanity. It's a very good book, i highly recommend it."
1792,g1y1aa,5,"* Crank by Ellen Hopkins 
* Burned by Ellen Hopkins 

\- Ellen Hopkins writes in a poetry style that tells a story. It is very accessible and easy to follow the story. Crank and Burned are two of my favorites of her books.  


* A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith

\- This follows a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, an incredible coming-of-age story and one of my all time favorite books.   


* The Count of Monte Cristo by Victor Hugo 

\- The length of this alone will push you far outside your comfort zone, but it is a very readable and fun story.   


* Wild by Cheryl Strayed 

\- One of my favorite memoirs and movies of the past few years. Tells the first hand account of a woman hiking the Pacific Crest Trail alone.   


* Blue Plate Special by Kate Christensen 

\- Connects stories of eating and food to a woman's life journey. A memoir I stayed up all night reading to finish.   


* Dry by Augusten Burroughs 

\- At times funny and sad, extremely well written memoir about the author's struggle to sobriety."
1793,g1y1aa,4,I suggest Lord of the Flies to see a dystopia as it is being created.
1794,g1y1aa,3,"One Hundred Years of Solitude, it’s historical fiction and fantasy in one, you’ll probably hate it. Just kidding, but seriously it’s a wonderful book and you’ll be a better reader if you can get through it :)"
1795,g1y1aa,3,"Maybe try these ones?

Steelheart by Brandan Sanderson (superhero, dystopia series)

The Walled City by Ryan Groudin (kinda based off history but not really historical, Adventure)
- Ryan Groudin has another book called Wolf by Wolf

Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz 
(Realistic, Coming of age story)"
1796,g1y1aa,3,"You should read Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage.  It's nonfiction but historical, and it gripped me in much the same ways that sci-fi and dystopian fiction does."
1797,g1y1aa,10,The Martian by Andy Weir. It's hard sci-fi.
1798,g1y1aa,5,"Historical fiction:

1. All The Light We Cannot See- it took me a bit to get into but the writing is absolutely beautiful and haunting. 
2. The Nightingale- this story is very moving. 

Contemporary:
1. The Poet X- this is a verse novel. It’s amazing. 
2. Crank- also a verse novel. Also amazing. 
3. Radio Silence- this is a beautiful coming-of-age story 

Dystopia:
1. 1984- bears striking resemblance to our world today. 
2. Steelheart series- I love this book"
1799,g1y1aa,3,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great book! It's also by Alexander Dumas, not Victor Hugo. ;)"
1800,g1y1aa,3,Check out [The Book Thief](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Book-Thief/) by Marcus Zusak. It is a really interesting book about nazi Germany and how a young girl steals a book to learn how to read.
1801,g1yu54,3,"If you want to read the entirety of the Divine Comedy then you always start with the first book, Inferno. After that, you read Purgatorio and then Paradiso."
1802,g1yu54,7,"You've been given the correct answer. Begin with Inferno, then Purgatorio, then Paradiso.

I personally enjoyed the John Ciardi translation. And I vouch that overall, it's an overwhelming reading experience which will stay with you the rest of your life."
1803,g1yu54,3,"Honestly, I feel the John Ciardi translation is almost the only way to go if you're not taking a college class on the Divine Comedy. The notes at the end of the Cantos made everything so much more clear."
1804,g1zbnx,5,"Damn, just realized how depressing my books are, the only one I found wholesome I believe it is entirely me and don't know if someone else would feel the same, so... :/"
1805,g1zbnx,6,"Pumpkinheads - by Rainbow Rowell
Alex, Approximately - by Jenn Bennett
Howl's Moving Castle - by Diana Wynne Jones
She Was Nice to Mice - by Aly Sheedy"
1806,g1zbnx,3,Naked - David Sedaris
1807,g1zbnx,3,"I think Stargirl is a nice read, as well as Love, Star Girl. If you want something a bit kore recent and perhaps a bit more mature, you could also try The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night."
1808,g1zbnx,7,"The Tao of Pooh (Benjamin Hoff) - *very comforting, very Zen.  A good bedtime read.  Pooh is a Zen master.*

Ella Minnow Pea (Mark Dunn)

The Essential Calvin &amp; Hobbes (Bill Watterson)

The Soul of An Octopus (Sy Montgomery) -and- How To Be A Good Creature

Anne of Green Gables (L.M. Montgomery)

The Giver of Stars (JoJo Moyes)

The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper (Phaedra Patrick)

Animal, Vegetable, Miracle (Barbara Kingsolver)

The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared (Jonas Jonasson)"
1809,g1zbnx,3,"One of the main themes of A Man Called Ove is suicide.  He is suicidal at the beginning of the book and people need him and he decides to live to help them.  That's not staying away from the subject, so take that into consideration.  That said, it's a great book.  I loved it.   I also sobbed while reading parts of it."
1810,g1zbnx,6,Harry Potter book series is as wholesome as anything I know. Maybe give it a try.
1811,g1zbnx,5,"I like all of Sophie Kinsellas' books, lighthearted, silly romances, all of them.  I don't know if that's your thing."
1812,g1zbnx,3,"OH ACTUALLY I DID READ SOME WHOLESOME BOOKS RECENTLY

- Weave a Circle Round by Kari Maaren
- The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin

Are those alright?"
1813,g1znyo,4,I got some pretty good laughs from a Confederacy of Dunces
1814,g1znyo,19,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.
1815,g1znyo,3,"Yeah, that's a great series. I loved them as a kid."
1816,g1znyo,4,"Depending on your humor, then, Kurt Vonnegut books are always a good way to go. I've laughed loudly because of them as well. On the other hand, Terry Pratchett is another great comic writer more in the vein of Adams."
1817,g1znyo,9,"Catch 22 is very funny to many, irritating to others. I was on the side of thinking it was very funny. I give it major major major major kudos, if you read it you will get a feather in your cap."
1818,g1znyo,6,Anything written by Mindy Kaling!
1819,g1znyo,11,Hyperbole and a Half by Ally Brosh
1820,g1znyo,3,"Well ""Why not me?"" and ""Is everyone hanging out without me?"" Both had me loudly laughing in my cubicle. Definitely give them a go"
1821,g1znyo,8,"The James Herriot books. They're hilarious and heartbreaking, often at the same time. I've read them through multiple times and there's a couple of moments that still make me cry with laughter."
1822,g1znyo,5,"Jerome K Jerome
Three men in a boat"
1823,g1znyo,5,"Anything by Christopher Moore, and especially my favourite: Lamb."
1824,g1znyo,4,"Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson. Yes, the raccoon on the cover is a real stuffed raccoon that she owns"
1825,g1znyo,9,"Terry Pratchett! Basically any Discworld book is not for reading on public transport, because snort-giggling out loud gets you side eye. Not a problem right now – there's never been a better time to read Pratchett."
1826,g1znyo,4,"I love this book! Also manages to be emotionally true at the same time, which is an achievement in itself."
1827,g1znyo,3,The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion really made me chuckle
1828,g1znyo,4,"As You Wish by Cary Elwes.

It details the events leading up to and including filming ‘The Princess Bride’, and it is so candidly written that I found myself crying with laughter.

Stories like Andre the Giant falling asleep in the middle of The Dorchester’s reception, Cary breaking his toe by taking a ride on Andre’s four wheeler... 

Gold."
1829,g1znyo,22,Anything by David Sedaris.
1830,g1znyo,5,"Came to say this - he's definitely my ""don't read in public"" author, having embarrassed myself too often by cackling maniacally while people are trying to enjoy their bus ride or whatever."
1831,g1znyo,3,Anything by Carl Hiaasen.
1832,g1znyo,3,"Brilliant, timeless, amazing book. Have you read the sequel? Three men on the bummel.

Available on project Gutenberg"
1833,g1znyo,4,"The Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich

The Martian by Andy Weir

The Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde"
1834,g1znyo,4,Was going to scroll through and say Me Talk Pretty One Day but I guess Me Post Faster Next Time
1835,g1znyo,3,Lamb.
1836,g1znyo,3,If you like that book you'd probably like the Diary of a Nobody by George and Weedon Grossmith.
1837,g20fiq,6,Read Kobo Abe- Woman in the Dunes. He is influenced by Kafka and its similar in that the questions are left unanswered
1838,g20fiq,22,"I am currently reading Blindness by Jose Saramago and it owes a lot to Kafka. It's fabulous and you'll love it, but fair warning: it's about an epidemic, so definitely not what you'd call escapist fiction just at the minute..."
1839,g20fiq,16,"oh no need to worry my friend, I’m currently in the middle of The Plague by Camus"
1840,g20fiq,6,Ouch! Maybe something a bit lighter to cleanse the palate? Have you tried Thomas Pynchon? The Crying of Lot 49 is very short (so a good first one to try - some are interminable) and leans in to the weirdness.
1841,g20fiq,3,Seconded. My favorite book of all time.
1842,g20fiq,10,"Brothers Karamazov, Master and Margarita, East of Eden (personal recommendation)"
1843,g20fiq,4,"I'm from Portugal, and pretty amazed that you are reading this. Where are you from? 

(The man is a Nobel prize, so definitely worth it, but still.. he's not that famous)"
1844,g20fiq,3,The crying of lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon
1845,g20fiq,3,"The Trial is great and should be required reading along with 1984 by George Orwell.  If you haven't read that or Animal Farm try them and Orwell's other lesser-known books like Coming up for Air or my favourite, A Clergyman's Daughter. Down and Out in Paris and London still resonates to this day. They are all well worth the read."
1846,g20fiq,9,I read those exact same books in the exact same order and I recommend you The Castle by Kafka. Maybe even more suspenseful than The Trial because of the simple fact that it is unfinished. You will dive in a strange village with some strange people with a even stranger Castle always looking down at you. Enjoy!
1847,g20fiq,5,"Great book. If you are interested in movies check out the film version, really a nice adaptation, the way everything is filmed, the dreamlike sets with weird architecture, the performance of the lead actor, and all those weird confusing characters... it’s like a visualized fever dream."
1848,g20fiq,8,"One of my favorite authors Laszlo Krasznahorkai said, 
 
&gt;“When I am not reading Kafka I am thinking about Kafka. When I am not thinking about Kafka I miss thinking about him. Having missed thinking about him for a while, I take him out and read him again. That’s how it works.

So you might like Satantango or War &amp; War"
1849,g20fiq,3,"Steven Berkoff made a few play adaptations of Kafka's novels, they are incredible in capturing every element!"
1850,g20fiq,3,"I’m from the US and Saramago is my favorite author. I also really love Portuguese literature in general; Pessoa, Eça de Queiroz, and Peixoto."
1851,g20fiq,5,"Hi, I'm Italian and I can fairly say that between people who read frequently that I know Saramago is quite popular here, I have personally read about five of his books and I will keep going. Don't underestimate your writers!"
1852,g20fiq,5,"Pessoa is different, for example. Is loved by everyone here.  
But still, it is amazing to find out Saramago is known that ""far'"" in the world! He deserves it. 

(Curious, does his different way of writing dialogue get translated in english? XD how does it feel for you? 
For us, it's like he can translate into words what real conversation feels like)"
1853,g20fiq,4,"Honestly, I would read some more Dostoevsky. I read The Double recently, and I actually forget it was Dostoevsky for awhile, it reminded me so much of Kafka.  

As far as something else that's outside the box, I would suggest Naked Lunch by William Burroughs. One of my top 3 favorite books."
1854,g20fiq,5,"The telescreens are our smart phones.  The govt can send us messages anytime, anywhere (Amber Alert). I refuse to use facial recognition on my phone and laptop. Next thing you know I'm been woken at 6AM for my mandatory 30 minutes of exercise for sluggish middle-aged people."
1855,g20fiq,5,"I’m from Australia and around 10 years ago a friend suggested I read Saramago. Ended up reading The Stone Raft. A few of my friends have read his stuff. He’s certainly not well known, but there are some of us on the other side of the world reading him :)"
1856,g20fiq,4,"I read Handmaids Tale years ago and as a result I couldn't watch the TV series because that made it even more real. I can see elements of it playing out now, the control over women's reproductive rights is just the beginning. I had a friend who saw conspiracy theories in everything.  He was often wrong but now, damn he was right on with some of them."
1857,g20fiq,3,"In English he separates different speakers by a comma and capital letter, except when someone uses “I”. So for example from All the Names:
 
&gt;Well, that’s what happened, I sat down and I went to sleep, You’re a brave man, No, I’m not that either, Did you find the person you were looking for, It’s that one there, right beside you, Is it a man or woman, A woman....

 I absolutely love how he writes dialogue. I also think it feels like an actual conversation. It flows together so well without  changing lines or using punctuation."
1858,g20fiq,3,"Have The Crying of Lot 49 and V. sitting on my shelf. Found V. easier to read than the former, never got too far into either of them. I’ll have to loop back around for another go. Love Pynchon’s humor"
1859,g20fiq,3,Never heard of him. I’ll have to take a deeper look. Thanks for the recommendation!
1860,g20fiq,3,"Oh my god I read Naked Lunch last fall and found it strange until I read the analysis. Absolutely genius book, and upon a second reading I loved it. As for more Dostoevsky, I have the Brothers Karamazov coming in the mail fairly soon. I’ll have to check out the Double at some point."
1861,g20fiq,3,"Pessoa - Book of Disquiet

Bolano - 2666 

Ishiguro - Unconsoled

Abe - Ark Sakura

Some Borges also 


Enjoy! The books above are some of my favorites."
1862,g20fiq,3,"Borges! Great call. Borges and Kafka are two all-time masters. 

Also, “The Savage Detectives” by Bolaño."
1863,g20fiq,3,"The Brothers Karamazov will positively change your life, as it did mine. And you should really check out those books by Balzac and Robert Louis Stevenson, too. Those authors are so brilliant, along with Dostoevsky, even their quotes will teach you things and challenge you to think expansively. Before committing to a book, look up some of their quotes and judge for yourself. You won't be dissapointed."
1864,g20fiq,3,Try Don de Lillo.
1865,g20fiq,3,I second this. I have read eerything Kafka has written and its my favorite
1866,g20fiq,3,"Wonderful. Despite the fact that I love long novels, I’ve come to understand that the time it takes to read books more so increases exponentially than linearly as the size gets bigger. You just get tired after a while, even with the greatest books ever written."
1867,g20fiq,3,"Haha. Read that one cover-to-cover on a flight to my first semester at a new college and, upon landing, was shaken up by the amount of existentialism thrown at me in such a brief amount of time. It was so strange. Almost like a drug. Loved that book."
1868,g2aphj,3,"***The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle***  by Stuart Turton. 2018.

***Now You See It...*** by Richard Matheson. 1995."
1869,g2aphj,4,"The word is murder - Anthony Horowitz.  It is a bit like an Agatha Christie whodunit mystery but set in modern times, and it is really funny too.  The author puts himself in the book which I really enjoyed."
1870,g2cwvq,3,Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is a good way to start. The book is wayyyyyy better than the movie and the book isn’t too long.
1871,g2cwvq,7,"Why not go for the ""Classics""?

Harry Potter is the book that initiated many of us (20-30 yo) into reading, as u/livsonn wrote!

It's really engaging, wholesome, easy to read and understand. Good for both children and adults. It is a must"
1872,g2cwvq,11,"The Martian by Andy Weir

Possibly the best book-to-film adaptation I've seen. Really fun."
1873,g2cwvq,4,"*The Green Mile* by Stephen King is a great read, and actually was kept pretty intact when it transitioned to a screenplay."
1874,g2cwvq,3,"Check out ALL SYSTEMS RED by Martha Wells (aka the first Murderbot story). It's a short, punchy science fiction novella with some good action and a dry sense of humor. If you enjoy it there are three more novellas already out and a full length novel that's currently scheduled to be published in May."
1875,g2cwvq,3,100% second this suggestion.
1876,g2cwvq,3,The Hunger Games or Maze Runner.
1877,g2cwvq,5,You definitely won't regret it! Come back and let us know how you like it!
1878,g2cwvq,3,"Both are good, much better than the movies."
1879,g2cwvq,3,"Very sound advice about putting down a book you don't like. I used to slog through bad books hoping they would get better. They never do.

Also, my daughter has an English degree and Twilight was what started her reading."
1880,g2eim7,4,"Peter Benchley's *'The Island'*

But I think whatever you saw on TV was probably exaggerated. As I understand it, when passing beyond a nation's territorial waters, the laws which apply on ships and planes are the laws of the country from which the ship or plane originates. 

The United Nations 'Office of the Law of the Sea' probably has info. 

'Admiralty law' aka 'maritime law' stems ultimately from Hugo Grotius or even John Locke; and also the German jurist L. F. L. Oppenheim."
1881,g2eim7,4,"Women aren't going to say ""No""... because of the implications."
1882,g2eim7,5,"Mutiny on Board HMS Bounty. 

If you want a short story, 'J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement' by ACD is great. It is about Mary Celeste, a ship whose crew and passengers disappeared mysteriously. ACD wrote the story and many people took his story to be the literal explanation for the fate of the ship's missing people when it was published."
1883,g2eim7,3,The North Water by Ian McGuire. Excellent book and great story.
1884,g2eim7,3,"Highly recommend it if you like his writing! Brutal story, but so well told"
1885,g2eim7,3,"Fun fact, maritime law also applies to space. This was actually alluded to in The Martian. A lot of crimes would technically speaking not be illegal in space because nobody owns it. :)"
1886,g2eim7,8,what are you looking at? you're not in any danger!
1887,g2eim7,3,"&gt;The Outlaw Ocean by Ian Urbina

Listened to the Audio Book, it's really good.   Not fiction, all first hand reporting."
1888,g2eim7,4,What’s the implication...?
1889,g2eim7,3,So they are in danger?
1890,g2eim7,8,"The implication that things might go wrong for her if she refuses to sleep with me. 

You know, not that things are going to go wrong for her, but she's thinking that they will."
1891,g2eim7,3,**Tigerman** by Nick Harkaway is about a Island that's in this situation because of it's status as a former British colony.
1892,g2eim7,4,Third vote for this one. Henry Drax is an unforgettable villain.
1893,g2eim7,3,Ah you are just trying to sneak in a good series of Zombie books.  Good choice.
1894,g2eim7,5,"Oh, you should read The Mysterious Island! It's also by Verne, and made me feel exactly the same. Just some good old fashioned adventure writing."
1895,g2eim7,9,"I apologize, sometimes I can't help myself."
1896,g2eim7,3,The Outlaw Sea by William Langewiesche is incredible and I'm pretty sure is just what OP ordered.
1897,g2eim7,4,Are these women in danger?
1898,g2eim7,6,"No one's in any danger. How can I make that any more clear to you? Okay, it's an implication of danger."
1899,g2eim7,7,They're quotes from a TV show - It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
1900,g2eim7,3,I already bought the book and I’m very excited to start it! I started Journey to the Center of the Earth and once I’m finished with it I’m starting Mysterious Island! For not being a reader Verne is my favorite
1901,g2eim7,3,Pretty much anything by him is top notch. Journey to Center of the Earth is his best work but Mysterious Island/20k Leagues are both top notch. Mighty Orinoco is another great read that isn't mentioned often.
1902,g2fako,3,The third man
1903,g2fako,3,"Darkness at Noon (Sonnenfinsternis) by Arthur Koestler -- a novel about an aging revolutionary who begins to be viewed as an enemy of the Party and becomes disillusioned. 

or

Scum of the Earth - Koestler fled Germany to Paris (1939-40) where the French promptly arrested him as an undesirable and tried to use him and others as bargaining chips for the Nazis. 

He wrote Darkness at Noon while living through the stuff of Scum of the Earth."
1904,g2fako,4,Came here to say this.
1905,g2fako,3,The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick
1906,g2fgwm,9,*To All the Boys I've Loved Before* by Jenny Han. There's an awesome Netflix movie of it too.
1907,g2fgwm,6,"Julie Kagawa's shadow of the fox series is great. No white men, but strong Asian characters without fetishes and great storyline."
1908,g2fgwm,15,The Bride Test by Helen Hoang
1909,g2fgwm,6,I heard about this book. Its been all over the place. Is the book actually any good? Have you read it?
1910,g2fgwm,6,OMG this sounds like a fine book! Thanks! ^_^_^
1911,g2fgwm,4,I just read the description and it sounds really really interesting! Thank a million!
1912,g2fgwm,5,"Trade Me by Courtney Milan. Although I don't know if I would call it ""clean""... it gets pretty sexy. Definitely no fetish stuff."
1913,g2fgwm,8,I have read all 3 in the series and they are very good! I loved them. They are a perfect beach read or something to take your mind off of things. I highly recommend for a good quarantine read!
1914,g2fgwm,4,No problem!
1915,g2fgwm,3,Flame in the Mist
1916,g2fgwm,7,"It's way better than the movies. Some asian traditions are also more shown in the book. Another one is Everything, everything. I think the main girl is half-Japanese so there's that. Eleanor and Park. Park is half-korean."
1917,g2fgwm,5,1Q84 series by Murakami.
1918,g2fgwm,14,"Not a romance novel, but kinda reminds me of The Joy Luck Club, and there are love stories within the novel: Pachinko by Min Jin Lee. It's so good!"
1919,g2fgwm,5,Shogun by James Clavell then
1920,g2fgwm,23,"Huh? That makes no sense when you look at your OP. You do realise with Asian fetish thing is about Asian women and white men.

Saw you reply to an 'Asiangirlslovetrump' account. Lmao you're one of those 'I don't date Asian guys cuz they remind me of my brother' ewwwww I hope your community ostracise your degenerate self"
1921,g2fgwm,6,Peony in Love by Lisa See. Anything at all by Lisa See really. Snowflower and the Secret Fan is my absolute favourite but it focuses more on friendship than romance.
1922,g2fgwm,28,What the actual fuck is this. “No fetish stuff”...then demands white male and Asian female lmao. Weirdo
1923,g2fgwm,7,"These aren't good by any means but I'll take what I can get as a fellow Asian lady.

* The Heart's Game - Christa McHugh (Vietnamese heroine, American hero)
* Mistaken Engagement - Jenny Schwartz (Vietnamese heroine, Australian hero)
* Her Invisible Soldier - Grace Risata (Japanese heroine, American hero)

Yes, I'm biased. If anyone knows of any more books with Vietnamese heroines, much appreciated. And no, I don't like Helen Hoang lol. All her female leads are definitely not or barely Asian."
1924,g2fgwm,4,"&gt; Snowflower and the Secret Fan

sounds interesting. I will keep that in mind."
1925,g2fgwm,3,"From the wiki

Shōgun is a 1975 novel by James Clavell. It is the first novel of the author's Asian Saga. A major best-seller, by 1990 the book had sold 15 million copies worldwide. Beginning in feudal Japan some months before the critical Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Shōgun gives an account of the rise of the daimyō ""Toranaga"". "
1926,g2fgwm,6,"What the fuck is an ""Asian fetish?""

Here's a book suggestion: [*Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White*](https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-America-Beyond-Black-White/dp/046500640X) by Frank H. Wu. Come back when you're less racist, OP.

*""[Wu's] defiant yellow-in-a-black-and-white-world perspective is refreshing.""* -- Mother Jones"
1927,g2fgwm,4,Which part is libleft? All I'm seeing is the racist right.
1928,g2fgwm,12,My fetish is careful avoidance of mentioning my fetish
1929,g2fgwm,10,"She's half Vietnamese. 

 [https://ew.com/author-interviews/2019/04/30/helen-hoang-the-bride-test-interview/](https://ew.com/author-interviews/2019/04/30/helen-hoang-the-bride-test-interview/)"
1930,g2fgwm,7,"It’d be so much less weird if he just came out and was like “yeah so I’m a white dude and I’m really into Asian women”. Honestly that would have been 100% fine and 100000 times better than his weirdly specific post lmao. 

Amy Tan wtf lmao."
1931,g2fgwm,5,I didn’t know you could decide someone’s race
1932,g2fgwm,6,Her other book The Kiss Quotient is also amazing. Can't wait for the third one to come out!
1933,g2fgwm,4,"&gt;WITHOUT any of the creepy asian fetish stuffs

dude your name is literally a racial slur"
1934,g2fgwm,3,I’m sorry are you 5?
1935,g2fgwm,4,"A lot of people read to find answers and shared experiences. For example, given the nuance of my experience in my family, I'd kill to find decent representation of couples that are half white american and half my race with out it feeling detached and fetishised. Books that talk about cultures mixing that dont trivialize the more ""exotic"" one. Just to find a sort of sense of belonging and normalcy and coping and potentially helpful points of view. It's not chasing or fetishy to just seek accurate and realstic portrayal of a normal life between two characters that are treated as equal to eachother."
1936,g2fgwm,3,"**Fuck you, OP.**"
1937,g2fgwm,6,there's like a 90% chance this is a white man roleplaying
1938,g2o3nx,3,Ishmael by Daniel Quinn
1939,g2qr5i,3,"Look behind you by Iris Johansen

The Chemist- by Stephanie Meyer"
1940,g2qr5i,15,"Curious: did you like it? I had such mixed emotions.  Great atmosphere,  fantastic concept, good writing.  But i couldn't get over feeling like the ending was a cheat. Like, ""Is tha answer A, B, or C? Surprise, it's actually D, which we never even told you about!"" There were probably more clues to the ending than I'm giving it credit for, but i was so irritated i didnt have to patience to reread it and see."
1941,g2qr5i,5,"I enjoyed it. I just finished it a couple of hours ago, so I haven't fully absorbed it yet, but overall I think I enjoyed the wackiness of the twists."
1942,g2qr5i,12,You could read Dark Matter or Recursion by Blake Crouch.  Twisty sci fi novels kind of like Evelyn Hardcastle.
1943,g2qr5i,7,"I loved it so much.

I guess I didn't read it as a true whodunnit. I kinda felt it was going to be something completely different all along."
1944,g2qr5i,4,"Anything by Ruth Ware or Tana French. Also, The Silent Patient and Eight Perfect Murders."
1945,g2qr5i,9,Anything by Gillian Flynn
1946,g2qr5i,3,Oooo...yes! Dark Matter!
1947,g2qr5i,5,"Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz. I read that first and Evelyn Hardcastle after, I think you would like it!"
1948,g2qr5i,3,But life feels pointless once you’ve finished all of her books...
1949,g2tidc,13,Erik Lawson also wrote In the Garden of Beasts about Nazi Germany. It's also a very good read.
1950,g2tidc,3,"Dead Wake by Eric Larson is great also. I have a history professor friend who raved about Thunderstruck also but I haven’t had a chance to read it yet.

Although it might not be exactly what you’re looking for I also loved The Book of William by Paul Collins. It’s a nice mix of history about Shakespeare’s First Folio. He’s got some others you might like as well."
1951,g2tidc,5,We Die Alone is great and I also had a book hangover after reading it. It is about Norwegian soldiers during WW2 who sail to Norway from Britain to attempt to establish a resistance force against Nazi occupation. They are ambushed and only one survives. It's the story of how he survives the barren landscape of Northern Norway in the winter.
1952,g2tidc,3,Yes I saw that! It's on my list of books to get. Thank you!
1953,g2tidc,4,"[Erik Larsen just did an AMA recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fpdyh3/im_erik_larson_author_of_six_bestselling_books/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).  

[This comment is especially inspiring](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fpdyh3/im_erik_larson_author_of_six_bestselling_books/flkkpo6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), Erik lists some of his own favorite authors."
1954,g2tidc,3,Haha book hangovers are the worst and best things to happen!
1955,g2tidc,3,OMG I’m glad book hangovers happen to other people and not just me.
1956,g2tidc,9,"Into Thin Air gripped me like that.  In fact, I read it right after I finished Devil in the White City."
1957,g2tidc,4,Jon Krakauer has some really great books as well.
1958,g2tidc,6,The underground railroad but Colson Whitehead. Historical fiction novel. Very riveting read!
1959,g2tidc,8,"Check out Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt. It's about the murder of a male prostitute in Savannah, GA. It's a dramatized true story and very gripping."
1960,g2tidc,7,But that book nails the banality of evil. It's shocking how much more mundane and remote the horrors were to the people at the top. Helps you remember how easy it is for human beings to tolerate tyranny and violence
1961,g2tidc,3,Eiger Dreams was my favorite of his. A compilation of mountaineering and survival stories
1962,g2tidc,3,"I feel like no one in this sub ever mentions this book, but Hellhound On His Trail by Hampton Sides sounds exactly like what you’re looking for. 

It’s about James Earl Ray’s stalking and assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and the largest manhunt in American history to nab him that followed. It’s riveting and reads like a movie."
1963,g2tidc,3,Into The Wild bored me so much. I was basically rooting for Alaska by the end of it.
1964,g2tidc,3,Ditto endurance! I had a major book hangover after that one...
1965,g36lao,3,Try the Binti trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor. Zero words are wasted.
1966,g36lao,5,"Earthsea by Ursula le Guin.

It's somehow both incredibly richly written and yet at the same time you barely get told what the main characters look like so it might work for you."
1967,g36lao,4,"I would try some of the Terry Pratchett Discworld books.    Specifically the Moist von lipwig story arc to start.   They are in the 30's in terms of book number but don't let that bother you.  My first ever Pratchett was Going Postal and then I started at 1 and finished them all in 8 months.

Also I saw someone else mentioned the gentleman bastards which I thought are great great books with fantastic plot and intrigue.   

I love Sanderson to death and mistborn is possibly one of my favorite series but if you have trouble picturing things I know some of my family have had to skim some of the (many) combat scenes in the books because of the over detailed parts of the combat.  

Hope this helps and good luck finding some fantasy to really intrigue you! 

Last thought would be the first law series by Joe Abercrombie is also really good but I haven't read it in many years so I don't totally remember how flourished the writing is"
1968,g36lao,3,"Halfway through Ishugaro, starts slow but after 1/4 i started to enjoy it a lot."
1969,g36lao,9,I really liked The Blade Itself by Joe Abicrombe. I remember describing it as a Game of Thrones without the waffle
1970,g36lao,3,"The Dune series (though it’s kind of a blend of fantasy and sci-fi). More of the imagination is in the world-building and character intrigue.

It’s got psychics, political drama, and great characters, without focusing too much on creating visuals.

It’s also all-around a good story that feels like an ancient epic. Highly recommended."
1971,g36lao,3,Dianna Wynne Jones writes rather matter of factly.
1972,g36lao,3,"Try the Riyria Revelations series by Michael J Sullivan. They’re lighthearted fantasy books, they have some description but not a ton, and they also have great dialog to keep you engaged. First book is “Theft of Swords.”

Do you use Audible? If so, search for “Jester” and “The Witch and the Viscount.” Both are free short stories in the series. The Witch... is actually a full chapter from one of the books so it’ll let you know exactly whether it’s too descriptive for you."
1973,g36lao,5,I’ve heard great things about Earthsea. Going on the list!
1974,g36lao,3,"Yep, came to suggest the same. Codex Alera (also by Butcher) is the same."
1975,g36lao,4,"Just going to say; stay away of the Wheel of Time. Great series overall (loved it), but Jordan spent a lot of time describing the scenes."
1976,g36lao,3,Tbh sometimes I just skim or even skip long descriptions that seem excessive or unnecessary.
1977,g36lao,3,People can see pictures when reading?
1978,g36lao,3,"I didn’t know about aphantasia before, I actually had no idea it was possible to NOT see pictures while reading! I find that super interesting, do you know how that works? Like is it just when reading or is it in general imagining something to that detail? Sorry if that’s too personal, I really hope you find the books you’re looking for!"
1979,g3clnw,6,PSA: Check if your local independent bookstore is shipping or delivering.
1980,g3clnw,3,Yeah books are amazing.
1981,g3clnw,7,"I wish reading was more common. The only people in my life who also read books are my aunt and my boyfriend. It’s good to see more people taking it up, hopefully the habit will stick post quarantine"
1982,g3clnw,10,"I've always been an avid reader, and my daughter likes to read too, but during quarantine we have both been devouring books. They're tossed everywhere around the house as we finish one and pick up another. My collection has become so big that I said ""fuck it"" and bought a new Kindle, and immediately downloaded six new books and three magazines."
1983,g3clnw,3,"I buy my books on Amazon (and use Goodreads for recommendations). But I also have a Kindle. E-readers made it SO much easier to read books anywhere I am. Also it's instant and no contact needed (given the situation). But i know many book readers are also against it so, up to you :)"
1984,g3clnw,4,Bookshop.org
1985,g3clnw,8,"And if not, bookshop.org is the next best option. Not Amazon or Barnes and Noble, and 5% of all their revenue goes to support local bookstores."
1986,g3clnw,3,"I feel you... it’s as if the older I get, the fewer people are interested in reading/talking about books."
1987,g3clnw,3,"I used to love reading as a teen, I don’t know what happened. I remember sitting on the floor of the teen fiction section in half price books with my best friend every weekend. We would read the summaries, or even first few chapters of any books we thought looked interesting. It would bug the sh*t out of me, but my friend would always skip to the end of a romance book to find out if the story ended well, then decide if the book is worth buying. Recently my coworker suggested some books for me to read, and surprisingly I just finished one! Ramona Blue - Julie Murphy. I personally loved it, and it definitely made me want to start reading again. So I bought like 5 more books the other day haha this is more than I’ve read in the past 3 years.."
1988,g3clnw,7,It looks like books are back on the menu boys!!!!
1989,g9owxy,3,It's a bad book with next to nothing in common with Ghibli movies.
1990,g9owxy,3,Also her Chrestomanci books! They're children's books but I enjoyed them even as an adult.
1991,g9owxy,9,I started that one but I couldn't really get into it. I preferred his book Ocean at the End of the Lane. It gave me the same vibe but was more fast paced to me.
1992,g9owxy,3,"There are very few books that I haven't finished. Most are Neil Gaimans. Also his audiobooks are bad cause he narrates them himself and he's not good at it, just goes up and down in volume way to much in the same sentence."
1993,g9owxy,4,"And the graveyard book! Big big studio ghibli vibes. (Although idk if it’s written for adults.
I read it as a kid but I read a lot of Gaiman as a kid that was definitely NOT for children)"
1994,g9owxy,3,"It might be for younger readers, but

The Neverending story

Might fit the bill."
1995,g9owxy,3,"I really recommend „The 13 ​1⁄2 Lives of Captain Bluebear“, which is my favourite book!

Seems like a child‘s book but turns our to be very complex and enjoyable - It‘s a Fantasy novel by Walter Moers (well known in Germany for various book and figures) which details the numerous lives of a human-sized bear with blue fur.
(From living in a nutshell to living in a tornado...)

Also Italo Calvinos „The invisible cities“ - I watched „Castle in the Sky“ yesterday and was constantly reminded of this! A ‚standard‘ in architectural education as well.
Rougly reads as a imagined travel diary of Marco Polo, who is presenting stories of cities and places he‘s seen."
1996,g9owxy,3,"Captain Bluebear was going to be my recommendation as well. Loved that book, need to read it again really, just waiting for my son to be old enough for me to read it to him."
1997,g9owxy,3,"Absolutely the answer is Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. It is Spirited Away (dark carnival, beautiful whimsical scenery and spirits juxtaposed with dark bizarreness) but in American rural form"
1998,g9owxy,3,Also Stardust.
1999,g9owxy,6,"Neil Gaiman is perfect for this- a lot of his writing has that magical, Ghibli vibe. He also wrote the screenplay for the dubbed version of Princess Mononoke."
2000,g9owxy,3,"This book is undoubtedly beautifully written with ethereal descriptions and surreal descriptions of Barcelona. I could not, however, get past how extremely sexist it was 😅 which was really a shame because I did love the characters, but the way in Zafon treated his female characters and the plot elements he relied upon to tell the story deeply stuck me as perpetuating inherently misogynistic narratives. It's a tricky book for me to recommend. 

Also, I agree with the previous comment: the climax was a bit anticlimactic."
2001,g9owxy,4,"It being a bad book is definitely subjective, I agree. It having nothing in common with Ghibli movies is fact."
2002,g9owxy,4,"If you haven't already, give his Norse Mythology audiobook a try. I think he did a marvelous job at portraying all the different characters, each with their own voice. If you don't like that one, though... Well, no point arguing about tastes and preferences :)

If you don't like his prose, maybe give his comics a try?"
2003,g9owxy,6,"Hey man, why don't you tell us how it fits the Ghibli mold instead of engaging in snide comments? It's literally the farthest a book can be from the kinds of movies Ghibli produces. Let me explain:  


Some key aspects of Ghibli movies are:  
\- Beautiful animation/music etc...: Clearly not applicable so we will ignore these

\- Lack of a clear distinction between good and evil characters: Not applicable. Magicians has some very clear villains

\- Focus on young adults or kids growing into their own: Not applicable. Magicians is about a bunch of college kids who do not grow up.

\- This is the biggest factor for me - Ghibli movies tend to focus on the mundane within the fantastic, the everyday rhythm of life that is always missing from other animated movies. It is in the simple actions of its characters that seem to behave like real people: DOES NOT APPLY to the Magicians. It is a very story driven book, with no emphasis on anything like I mentioned above.

The only thing that is in common - and I am really stretching here is that Ghibli movies often have magical elements and The Magicians is about magic. But I don't see how a book that talks about a Narnia like world, where animals talk and the villain is a person who was molested as a child and who eats off entire people, and characters who lie and cheat is in the same ballpark as this studio's movies."
2004,g9owxy,4,I second trying his comics. Sandman is a masterpiece.
2005,g9owxy,3,"Sabriel by Garth Nix 100%. Technically it’s often shelved under YA, but it reminds me SO much of Studio Ghibli. The main character, Sabriel, is a young necromancer on a quest to save her father from death. It has that dreamy quality that Ghibli movies have, plus it even has a snarky cat companion and a whimsical flying machine. It’s also just seriously good, definitely check it out!"
2006,g9owxy,4,I second Borges. I'm a big fan of The Immortal and The South.
2007,g9owxy,5,"I may be an odd one out, but I hated this book. It was so cynical and the narrator was a horrible person, which feels like the exact opposite of any Studio Ghibli film."
2008,g9owxy,3,"Oh man, the one where the boy can take things in and out of his dreams, so so good."
2009,g9owxy,3,"YESSS, here for this. The art is astounding."
2010,g9owxy,4,"THIS! They all fucking suck. Especially when Q saw how life can turnout by watching Alices parents, they all basically went head first into that kind of life! Wtf?! Better than Harry Potter my ass."
2011,g9owxy,3,Thanks. The title is super intriguing.
2012,g9owxy,3,I love Latin American literature. I'll read One Hundred Years of Solitude.
2013,gkxprq,4,"I’m an ICU nurse and after I read The Metamorphosis, I often think of trauma patients who wake up completely changed in a new body and have to make major adjustments- both psychological and physical."
2014,gkxprq,4,“The Fall” is one of my favorite novels of all time. Really made me think.
2015,gz11xx,452,Good Omens
2016,gz11xx,42,I second this wholeheartedly
2017,gz11xx,23,Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay
2018,gz11xx,141,"The Heroes by Joe Abercrombie. 

Its about two armies at war with each other (in like fantasy-medievel times) and you get to know characters on both sides and don't want either to lose. 

It isn't my favorite book by this author, but it fits what you're looking for."
2019,gz11xx,35,Little Fires Everywhere
2020,gz11xx,13,Crime and Punishment.
2021,gz11xx,13,Kane and Abel
2022,gz11xx,26,I third this. Love this book.
2023,gz11xx,3,Second this!
2024,gz11xx,19,How are both sides good in 1984?
2025,gz11xx,10,"Yea, how does this kind of fit? I’m not mad, just so interested in how you got there"
2026,gz11xx,41,"Magician by Raymond E Feist. Coming of age fantasy. It’s part of a trilogy, the riftwar saga, that I highly recommend."
2027,gz11xx,6,"pleaae respond, we must know"
2028,gz11xx,3,I'm gonna be honest that I don't remember everything in that book but like the protagonist and his love interest act in opposition to the obviously tyrannical government. OP was asking for two big sides who are both right.
2029,gz11xx,15,Thanks for this! I'm currently reading it and I love it so far.
2030,gz11xx,33," Lions of Al-Rassan, by Guy Gavriel Kay - historical fantasy loosely set in Spain during the Christian reconquest from the Moors.  It’s really good."
2031,gz11xx,5,That sounds counterintuitive
2032,gz11xx,13,"Not talking about the biblical tale.
This book by Jeffrey Archer has two leads and by the end of the book it's nigh impossible to say which one of them is wrong. You can't help but cheer for both and be conflicted.
I thought that's what the OP wanted."
2033,gz11xx,4,"Just finished last week.

2039,gz11xx,19,"The First World War: Hew Strachan

This is one of the more objective examples of historiography I’ve experienced. Strachan goes a little deeper into the ideas A) that new Germany was subject to several injustices by the standing empires, and B) of Austro-Hungarian oppression of the Serbs (and others).

To look a little deeper, a realization occurs that the generally accepted causes of WWI are in themselves reactionary. This would, logically, extend culpability."

2041,gz11xx,4,"A series by Janny Wurts, Wars of Light and Shadow, are perfect for this.

Two people who are polar opposites both doing what they think is best for the people they care about, and humanity at large. There is no ""good"" guy and ""bad"" guy. Just people. 

It's a fantasy series, so if you don't want something fantastical, it may not be the right series for you, but it's honestly one of my favorite series of all time. It pits mercy and justice against each other, rather than good vs bad. Can't recommend it enough!"

Even after confession I wouldn't really consider him a ""good guy"""
2044,gz11xx,3,"Aww, happy ending!"
2045,gz11xx,4,"Correct, and he never felt any remorse towards the victims, at least not explicitly. He felt bad because he felt that he failed his crime miserably and was anxious about getting caught. He's not a good guy imo"

2064,gz11xx,14,"Children of Time, fantastic series. You end up getting attached to both sides of the story and somehow wanting both to survive, and stop misunderstanding each other.

Another that is similar, but more like feeling attached to multiple ""sides"" of a conflict, with each of their own valid reasons for doing what they're doing, is the Traitor Baru Cormorant series. It's fantastic, it's about a lesbian accountant who rises to power within an imperial bureaucracy, it'll really make you question whether the good is in the longterm order and happiness, or in freedom. I highly recommend both it and its sequel, the Monster Baru Cormorant. The third is coming out soon!!"

I can definitely see where it could stir up feelings while pregnant! I think it is worth going back to read when you are ready. I am already planning to read it again I am a couple years because I think I will see different things as my son gets older and I grow into a new phase of motherhood.

If you google, it might seem religious-y, but I'll just mention it's not religious or preachy in that conventional sense. It more just uses that as a backboard for asking big questions--who are we, why are we here, what should we be doing, etc. The main focus is discussing ego, but not in the sense of, ""Oh he/she's got a big ego,"" but more acknowledging we all have one, that is, a sort of identity/role we spend our lives filling. Really interesting insights in there.

On another note--best of luck, girl. Honestly, everyone our age is a hot mess. It's just some people are less aware that they are, so if you're coming to terms, you're probably ahead of the curve! You got this :)"

“I’m rubbish when it comes to small talk, so please forgive me if I embarrass myself, it’s only a matter of time.”

Seems to work sometimes."
2184,gzkswt,21,"Look up Leil Lowndes': *How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships*.

By way of full confession, I haven't personally read it.  I did, however, read reviews, mull over the table of contents, and purchase it a number of years ago for my socially-awkward nephew who was having trouble integrating with new groups during his first year in college.

And more important than my opinion, is that *HE* found it extremely useful.  I never did get a play-by-play analysis or anything, but I can tell you that a decade later, he's one of the most natural and charming members of my entire extended family.  He's happily married, well connected in business and his social life, and by consensus a pleasure to be around.

Maybe he just grew up, maybe this helped.  But it's the best endorsement I have to give."
2185,gzkswt,9,"My daughter really struggles with small talk as well. She is 16. I told her to try to remember that if you smile and say hello, that is an excellent starting point. A smile really helps you to remember to open up your heart to any interaction with a person. If you remember this next suggestion it will help you a great deal. I promise! People love to talk about themselves, so just try to ask them very basic, simple questions about themselves to get the good will flowing. A sincere compliment works wonders as well to open up the channel to chat. Small talk gets easier the more you try it. Sometimes an attempt at small talk goes nowhere. That is perfectly fine! No one is keeping score! So here is my little list of suggestions to get you started on the road to becoming someone who actually starts to look forward to small talk interactions:
1) SMILE   ( this opens your heart to the interaction)
2) SAY HI OR HELLO (breaks the ice)
3) ASK THE OTHER PERSON A SIMPLE QUESTION   (“How are you doing today?”) Don’t worry about asking a silly question. Any sincere, simple question will work. It just signals to the other person that you are friendly and open to a little chat.
4) TRULY CARE ABOUT THE PERSON’S ANSWER (Don’t worry about not sounding smart enough or funny enough. The other person is not looking for that. The person is just looking for a smile, sincere warmth from your heart, genuine concern from you even if your chat only lasts for 5 seconds.)
5) DO NOT WORRY THAT THE OTHER PERSON IS JUDGING YOU (Just bring your authentic self, smile, and warmth from your heart to every small talk interaction.)
6) DO NOT LET A SMALL TALK FAIL DISCOURAGE YOU  (Sometimes a person doesn’t respond. No worries! You tried your best to share a brief, small moment with them, and it didn’t work out. No worries! Sometimes people have a lot on their mind and it just doesn’t work. That’s ok! You left them with a smile and genuine human warmth from your heart. You did all you could.)
7) KEEP SMALL TALKING ( I promise it gets easier and actually can be fun, enjoyable, heartwarming, and powerful. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a very brief but profound conversation with someone. Sometimes great truths, beautiful statements, and magic happen within the space of a few minutes in a brief little chat. Open your heart- you will be amazing!)"

The Ranger’s Apprentice series is a little more low fantasy, so there’s not a ton of magic (main characters are expert archers and knights), but the characters and stories are excellent and the world is heavily based-on real world cultures from history. 

Fablehaven is a gorgeous series about a brother and a sister who discover that their grandparents are the caretakers for a secret preserve that contains and protects magical creatures. The author, Brandon Mull, has a lot of other excellent fantasy stories too, like Beyonders and The Candy Shop War.

Charlie Bone is a fun series about an arts school filled with students who have unexpected and unique powers because they are all descended from a powerful wizard called the Red King. Charlie, for example, can talk to the people in paintings and pictures.

Children of the Lamp is about a brother and sister who discover that they are in fact genies (or djinni, as they prefer to be called) on their mother’s side, and they learn what their newfound wish-granting powers mean for them. There’s a lot of Middle-Eastern culture in these!

Spiderwick Chronicles is a more classical take on the “kids discover faeries” genre, with the fae being portrayed as tricky, subtle, beautiful, and a teensy bit gothic. Very good series—much better than the movie.

Leven Thumps is another wonderful fantasy series. This one is very comedic, and more of a fun romp than an intense epic.

Artemis Fowl is an excellent book series that combines Sci-Fi and fantasy into a series of fun and vibrant adventures that follow the titular character’s growth from a criminal mastermind to a hero by the end.

Peter and the Starcatchers is a fantasy series reimagining of the Peter Pan legend that I adored as a child. The main villain is terrifying, though—he’s a inky cloaked monster that steals people’s shadows to control them—so this one might be better when she’s a liiittle older. They’re really imaginative and rich books, though, and they take place in the gaslight era of English history."
2192,gzmqw2,3,"I don't mean to, I just end up recommending it all over the place... Great book, great trilogy rather, but i just seem to find threads looking for the ""next step"" from Harry potter, or ""something with a female lead for a teen-ager"", or ""something that describes the act of magic well""... 
I've read literally hundreds of books, and this seems to be the one that fits the asks every time, and each time I have to think ""should I?""... Invariably the answer is yes, it's a great series:)"
2193,gzmqw2,3,"I think her most younger (middle school) reader friendly series is Protector of the Small series, the first book is First Test. The Alana books are her first series, but a bit more adult than some of her others, although still not graphic. If starting in an already built world is hard then I would start with the circle of magic books, they take place in a completely different setting."
2194,gzmqw2,3,"The Phantom Tollbooth,  I didn't want it to end."
2195,gzmqw2,3,The Tiffany Aching novels by Terry Pratchett
2196,gzqnqb,13,"The majority of stories that  H.P. Lovecraft wrote have been admired by movie writers and directors alike, but no one has really ""captured"" his unspeakable horrors. The recent release of *The Colour Out Of Space* featuring Nic Cage was a wonderful modern adaptation though."
2197,gzqnqb,5,Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy
2198,gzqnqb,8,David Lynch's adaptation of Dune was kind of a legendary disaster.
2199,gzqnqb,10,"Cannery Row by John Steinbeck. That novel can’t be told in any other format, it simply is too multilayered with too many mini stories. They tried to make it a film a while ago and created an awful romance film - the novel being very very far from a romance."
2200,gzqnqb,18,House Of leaves
2201,gzqnqb,12,"The Dark Tower series, apparently"
2202,gzqnqb,4,"Yes!! My God did that movie become a hot dumpster fire, I was so disappointed... I've come to terms with the idea I will never see Roland anywhere but my imagination."
2203,gzqnqb,3,Its like they decided to make every bad decision possible just to fuck with us
2204,gzqnqb,4,But Vincent D’Onofrio as The Judge.
2205,gzqnqb,4,"Not only that but then the powers that be said, ""Hey, we're going to make amends and make it into a awesome Amazon series so we can cover everything....WAIT...NOPE...Just kiddin' guys, it's already cancelled!"" That's when I realized that I love the series so much that maybe I should stick to my imagination and not count on a film adaptation...

Or as Jake says, ""*I don't like people, they fuck me up*."""
2206,gzqnqb,4,People have tried for years to get A Confederacy of Dunces on screen. Don't think it will happen.
2207,gzqnqb,3,Even as someone who loved Mandy I found that adaptation to be one of the worst things I've ever seen. It's basically a haunted house movie but the ghost is the color purple
2208,gzqnqb,3,"Mandy was a phantasmagorical treat! Maybe I was so desperately wanting any kind of adaptation that I was more fond of it (plus, a seven headed Alpaca and Nic Cage was quite a screaming/bleating show!) my husband hated it, but supposedly it was the first of a trilogy of H.P. Lovecraft adaptations that will tie together, the idea of it being modernized definitely threw me off, it's the same story, but not..at all....the only other Lovecraft adaptation I enjoy is the cult classic The Re-Animator (which is a very loose adaptation!) so maybe I'm just grasping at straws here..."
2209,gzqnqb,3,I don’t see Chaos Walking being faithful to the book. I honestly have no idea how they’re going to replicate the Noise on screen the way it is in the books.
2210,gzqnqb,6,"Waiting for the new Dune movie. 
Fingers crossed. 🤞🏻"
2211,gzqnqb,5,"The bible. 

No continuity. CGI required would bankrupt Disney!"
2212,gzqnqb,3,Flatland by Edwin Abbott !!!!
2213,gzqnqb,5,"ohhh i feel like no matter how good the movie might be, I am so disgusted by the notion of it being made into a movie..."
2214,gzqnqb,4,"This was my first thought as well. Reading it is such an experience! I'm not sure a movie would be able to accurately translate that disoriented, claustrophobic feeling onto the screen."
2215,gzqnqb,3,hard to structure a 2h movie adaptation. that book is kinda just a lot of scenes put together.
2216,gzqnqb,4,Finnegan's Wake
2217,gzqnqb,3,I bet the whole Red Rising series would be such a horrible flop
2218,gzqnqb,4,Cloud Atlas is an absolutely amazing book. I mean they tried to make a movie but I consider it not a movie after how bad it was.
2219,gzqnqb,5,"Personally, I believe Stephen King’s “It” should never have been translated into film."
2220,gzqnqb,6,"Hast thou never watched ""Sesame Street,"" varlet!?"
2221,gzuei5,10,"I was really moved by and excited about Wake of Vultures by Lila Bowen. I’ve never read anything like it. It’s action packed and pretty funny in some places, even while working through some very big issues.

Just a warning that some people may be bothered by a couple scenes which involve sexual menace, but I think it’s worth it to fall in love with that main character.  

Working my way through the second, now. I definitely plan to read the whole series."
2222,gzuei5,3,"I just want to be able to relate to a main character, and an AI in a body might not be... really relatable?

Thanks for the suggestion though."
2223,gzuei5,4,"Hi! You might be interested in [Felix Ever After](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062820259) by Kacen Callender. I haven't read it personally, but I've heard a lot of good things about it. The author is trans."
2224,gzuei5,4,"It's far from being an accurate suggestion, but have you had a look at [this Goodreads list?](https://www.goodreads.com/list/tag/ftm) Happy Pride month :)"
2225,gzuei5,4,There is a book about a transgender male who helps run a radio station but I can’t remember the name of it. 😅
2226,gzuei5,3,"The book is called Beautiful Music for Ugly Children. 

Another one is called I am J."
2227,gzuei5,6,"Are you looking for a specific genre? (Also are you looking for YA? I don't want to rec something that isn't in the scope of something you are looking for or too racy, and I'm not the best at finding realistic fiction, so genre-wise I might be kinda bad at giving you recs)

Stuff I have read that I liked:

When the Moon Was Ours by Anne Marie McLemore has a split POV with one main character being a trans dude if I remember right, it's mostly magical realism (but it was really good imo)

Jy Yang's Black Tides of Heaven was good, tonally I'd say it's close to Garth Nix's Sabriel series, I haven't read past the first book yet

If you like really out there sci-fi, Blackfish City has a main character who is either a trans dude or nb but I'm 99% sure he was trans if my memory isn't wrong, but that book was also really, really confusing and I was lost for other reasons. Still a good read, though.

Edit: Witchmark by C.L. Polk was good and has a trans dude as the main character if I remember right?

I can rec some other stuff I've heard good things about, but tbh I'm on the hunt for the same thing.

 I've heard I Am J is good, although I have not read it, and Dov Zeller wrote The Right Thing to do At the Time which has a trans main character, but I have not read it yet, either. 

Same goes for Raven Tower by Anne Leckie, which has weird second person narration observing the main character, and I haven't got too far with that one. If I can find more on my list, I'll add more.

Edit: Here's some more I forgot, although I either haven't read them or didn't like them as much, or I'm not sure if they are not the genre you are looking for or some of them aren't POV of the trans dude directly.

Peter Darling by Austin Chant- I thought it was okay-ish but underwhelming and kinda blah to follow at parts, it's Peter Pan reimagining and I don't remember if there was anything too risque because it was a really forgettable book imo.

Undertow by Brooklyn Ray also is a risque book and part of a series, but it has a second main character who is trans (if you do read the genre it may be dysphoria inducing at parts due to risque scenes and the terms they use, and the ending in underwhelming imo.)

Also, Kacen Callendar's writing is solid, I haven't read their book with a trans dude's POV yet, but I'd recommend the writing style based on their other stuff.

Amberlough has a trans secondary character if I remember right, but I don't recommend it personally, I DNF'd it.

Edit 3: Have not read this yet, but Jaya and Rasa: A Love Story by Sonia Patel I've heard also has a POV trans main character, although I also heard this book has some really heavy stuff and can't attest to anything about it."
2228,gzuei5,21,"I came here to recommend this one.  ""Beautiful Music for Ugly Children"".

I'm doxxing myself, but the author is my sister."
2229,gzuei5,4,That's amazing &lt;3
2230,gzuei5,3,Parrotfish was one of my faves when I first started coming out. I definitely second the rec for beautiful music for ugly children but a warning iirc there's a warning for assault on it
2231,gzvgkt,3,"Woman on the Edge of Time by Marge Piercy

On the surface it seems to be describing utopia...... but is it really?"
2232,gzvgkt,8,Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro- Little things build up here and there until you can't help but be very wary of the situation. I won't say any more for fear of spoilers.
2233,gzvgkt,4,Fever dream by samanta schweblin
2234,gzw0vb,11,The Color Purple by Alice Walker
2235,gzw0vb,11,"oooh, and Sing, Unburied, Sing by Jesmyn Ward"
2236,gzw0vb,5,"Jojo and Kayla are the most endearing kids I’ve ever read I think. While their mother, Leonie, is a bit of a mess, she’s faced really brutal racism in her life. The whole family dynamic between Jojo, Leonie, Pop, Mam, Kayla, Given, and Michael is so powerful. There’s a lot (and I do mean a LOT) of depth and emotion in this novel. It’s easily soared to the top of my favorites list, and it has all the makings of canonical literature."
2237,gzw0vb,3,I thought it could be a good fit but I was nervous suggesting something I hadn’t read. But what you describe makes it sound perfect for the list- Appreciate you!
2238,gzw0vb,6,"An American Marriage 

Bluebird, Bluebird"
2239,gzw0vb,15,"Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman by Ernest Gaines (it is fiction)  #1 choice, less than 300 pages, easy to comprehend

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou (a memoir but reads like narrative)

Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston

Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi (starts in Africa then shifts to America)"
2240,gzw0vb,3,"Second this! It felt to me like a slightly different viewpoint from other books with similar themes, plus the modern-day setting makes it feel very relevant."
2241,gzw0vb,4,"Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo. Maybe a tiny bit longer than you want but such a quick and easy read, lots of characters and viewpoints, and also enjoyable humour in places.
Edit to say one of the characters is a white woman in her 60s who has something of a journey over the course of the book."
2242,gzw0vb,3,"Gaines is phenomenal.  The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman is a good suggestion.  A Lesson Before Dying and A Gathering of Old Men would also be great choices, as would Their Eyes Were Watching God and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.  

edit- Sounds like I need to read Homegoing.  I like everything else u/sarcasticfringefish recommended!  BTW I’m a white guy in my 60’s."
2243,gzw0vb,7,"The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead was really good in my opinion. He's also written The Nickel Boys that I haven't read yet, but have heard good things about and is on my reading list."
2244,gzw0vb,6,Anything by Toni Morrison
2245,gzw0vb,3,"The Nickel Boys is great, definitely recommend!"
2246,gzw0vb,4,"I have two suggestions for you: 

The Mothers by Britt Bennett. 

The characters’ race is not necessarily a focal point of the plot, which I think can go a long way in making the book “relatable” to white readers. In a way it almost serves to show them how the lives of BIPOC have a lot more commonalities to their own than they may have previously thought. It touches on a lot of topics that can lead to insightful discussion and reflection such as adultery, suicide, abortion, and coming of age. 

Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi. 

It begins in Ghana in the late 18th century with the stories of two half sisters and follows several generations of their family tree, one branch of which remains in Africa while the other is forcibly removed by means of the slave trade to North America. Each chapter tells part of one descendant’s life, so they can almost be read &amp; discussed as separate short stories. It is heartbreaking, but an incredibly important book for anyone to read. Truly some of the most beautiful writing I have ever come across."
2247,gzw0vb,4,"Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo.

Follows the intertwining stories of multiple BPOC  women living in Britain with very different lives/ages/background etc. Such an interesting and eye-opening read."
2248,gzw0vb,4,"I second an America Marriage. It’s tragic, but not as catastrophically tragic as some other books recommended here. It’s an easy read. A lot of these suggestions are very “literary” and not “mass market paperback.” AM was in Oprah’s Bookclub and touches a lot on themes of marriage and family in a super relatable way. And also race, racism, and the police state. This is the book I would recommend to my mom."
2249,gzw0vb,6,"All YA but great books that really show different experiences:

“The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas

“Dear Martin” by Nic Stone

“All American Boys” by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely"
2250,gzw0vb,4,"I came to suggest Octavia E. Butler as well. I second the recommendation for _Parable of the Sower_ and recommend the next book _Parable of the Talents_. The two books are set in a not-so-distant future and have added relevance with climate change element of the plot. 

Kindred_ is a powerful time travel tale in which a contemporary (published in 1979) black woman is transported back in time and saves her white ancestor without initially realizing that was the situation. There is a graphic novelization version. 

Another recommendation is for Nella Larsen’s novel _Passing_. Two women who knew each other in childhood reconnect while one of them is passing as white. There is an upcoming movie version that started filming late 2019; for some folks that makes reading a book more urgent."
2251,gzw0vb,3,Nella Larsen is a Harlem Renaissance author. _Passing_ is sometimes published with her other novel _Quicksand_. She just recently was added to a USPS stamp!
2252,gzw0vb,3,"The Help is a pretty good, rather fun book. Although fictional, I feel like it is fairly historically accurate."
2253,gzxgnc,7,"His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman is really immersive in a similar way. 

Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, V.E. Schwab are all great authors with tons of books and worlds to get lost in."
2254,gzxgnc,6,"I’d recommend the Septimius Heap series, if you don’t mind longer books. It’s also about wizards, but in a more classic fantasy setting. It’s very fun, the characters are all interesting, and you can really get sucked into the world. 

I’d also recommend the Fablehaven series by Brandon Mull. Two kids stay with their somewhat estranged grandparents for two weeks in the summer and discover that their grandparents actually operate a secret preserve for magical creatures. Things quickly take a turn for the strange (and dangerous), and more secrets keep popping up. It’s aimed for somewhat younger teens/tweens, but my whole family still enjoys them, so I think that’s a pretty good sign lol. 

Also by Brandon Mull, The Beyonders is a series about some kids who get transported to a strange, imperiled fantasy world, a world they have to help save. Again another intended for younger audiences boom that can be enjoyed by just about anyone."
2255,gzyu4s,6,The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks
2256,gzyu4s,3,A Head Full of Ghosts
2257,gzyy5p,3,"The Testing by Joelle Charbonneau is often compared to Hunger Games. The thing is The Testing is way better. Cooler protagonist, more realistic setting, and some crazy plot twists."
2258,gzyy5p,12,Red rising. It's like hunger games but in space.
2259,gzyy5p,3,Second this! Started on a friend’s recommendation and blew through the first three when quarantine started.
2260,gzyy5p,6,"The Throne of Glass Series! Even the first book gives off some Hunger Games vibes.

It basically follows the story of an assassin who was captured and forced to work in the mines, but then because of her past, she was made to make a deal with the prince/king that if she wins a competition to become 'The King's Champion' she'll be set free-"
2261,gzyy5p,6,The [Atlantis Grail](https://www.veranazarian.com/atlantisgrail.html) series by Vera Nazarian. First book is about a competition to choose the 12-18 year olds who will be taken from earth before it is struck by an asteroid and moved to the Atlantean's new homeworld.
2262,gzyy5p,9,Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. When Hunger Games first came out it made me think of this book
2263,gzyy5p,3,Skyward by Brandon Sanderson
2264,gzyy5p,3,"The *Binti* Trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor.

*Who Fears Death* by Nnedi Okorafor."
2265,gzyy5p,5,Or Mistborn by the same author?

2267,gzyy5p,3,Maze Runner series by James Dashner...
2268,h00vh7,6,The Heretic's Daughter (Kathleen Kent)
2269,h00vh7,5,"Arthur Miller's play The Crucible (1953). Focused on the 1692 Witch trials, his true purpose was comparing it to the scourge of McCarthyism sweeping across America at the time. Along with Edward Albee, Miller is considered among the greatest American playwrights of the 20th century, as he also wrote The Glass Menagerie and Death of a Salesman. As a side note, Miller was married briefly to actress Marilyn Monroe."
2270,h01l0k,6,Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro
2271,h01l0k,5,Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. By the end of your journey through this lengthy masterpiece you would wanna take a moment to appreciate how far you have come. And the epilogue ties a bow on your journey. Hopefully this helps.
2272,h01ygt,7,Have you tried anything by Neil Gaiman? The Ocean at the End of the Lane in particular gave me a similar vibe and impression.
2273,h01ygt,3,Winter's Tale
2274,h01ygt,4,"Little, Big (John Crowley)

The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender (Leslye Walton)

Neverwhere (Neil Gaiman) - also, The Ocean at the End of the Lane

Practical Magic (Alice Hoffman) - also, The Museum of Extraordinary Things

The House of the Spirits (Isabel Allende)

Winter's Tale (Mark Helprin)

Something Wicked This Way Comes (Ray Bradbury)

Garden Spells (Sarah Addison Allen) - also, The Girl Who Chased the Moon. The Sugar Queen.

The Snow Child (Eowyn Ivey)

Midnight's Children (Salman Rushdie)"
2275,h01ygt,7,"Try anything by Charles De Lint. J feel like i never see him mentioned on here. My favorites are:
Someplace to be flying

Forests of the Heart

Jack the Giant Killer

Newford Stories (a book of short stories)

Little Country 

He's my absolute favorite I own pretty much all of his books."
2276,h01ygt,3,Charles de Lint is the besssstttttttttttt and you are RIGHT! He doesn't get mentioned nearly enough.
2277,h03odc,125,"If you enjoyed that one, you might like “Brave new world” (Huxley), and “Fahrenheit 451” (Bradbury), if you haven’t already read them. They are classics in the dystopian genre. 
Furthermore, you have “Animal farm” (also from Orwell), and more recent novels like “The Giver” (Lowry), “The handmaid’s tale” (Atwood), and “The circle” (Eggers). 

Hope you enjoy your readings :)"
2278,h03odc,11,Really good list right here! And handmaids tale is just so good I had to comment lol
2279,h03odc,79,"""We"" by Yevgeny Zamyatin scratched the itch 1984 originally left for me after I read it more than anything else. It was basically a direct inspiration for all the more well known dystopian books."
2280,h03odc,4,"Haha. Yes, very well written."
2281,h03odc,18,*We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin.
2282,h03odc,18,Another really good read is The Postmortal by Drew Magary. Dystopian novel about if society finds the cure to aging
2283,h03odc,7,"I thought of the same books! They are going to make you think a lot, my favorite is “brave new world” you definitely should read that one"
2284,h03odc,8,"Stephen King's ""The Running Man"" could fit :)"
2285,h03odc,8,No one ever mentions “this perfect day” by Ira Levin and it is so relevant right now.
2286,h03odc,3,This perfect day by ira Levin
2287,h03odc,7,Haven’t read that one. Will look it up.
2288,h03odc,5,I loved Animal Farm. It started as “I’ll just read a chapter before bed” to a “ Dear it’s 2am “. Sorry babe. You knew I forget about time when reading when you married me.
2289,h03odc,5,Following this thread! I love 1984 and Farhenheit 451.
2290,h03odc,10,My husband raves about the Scythe series

2293,h03odc,5,"I feel like recommending also its sequel, The Testaments. Amazing"
2294,h03odc,3,I feel like you'd love Blindness by jose Saramago and its sequel Seeing
2295,h03odc,3,We
2296,h03odc,4,I second this. More so for young adults if I’m thinking of the same one as you but really great. Written by Shustermann?
2297,h03odc,13,Murakami's 1Q84 is an interesting take on 1984!
2298,h03odc,9,V for Vendetta graphic novel
2299,h03odc,3,"Yes! So unique and incredibly well written with a bit of wit and a lot of intelligence. Set in a dystopian future where society is divided by what colour they can see (the ""greys"" being at the the bottom of the pile)."
2300,h03odc,6,Anthem by Ayn Rand and THX-1138 by G Lucas.
2301,h03odc,7,You should check out Orwell’s other works. His essays are also great to read!

2303,h03odc,3,"Is this the same as ‘the end specialist’? 

Thats what i get if i look the author up on kindle"
2304,h03odc,3,Catch-22 by Joseph Heller
2305,h03odc,4,"That one is maybe one of the best books I have ever read.I heard,that Aldous Huxleys ""A brave new world"" and Jewgenij Samjatins ""We"" inspired this book,so I’d recommend these.Also ""Animal Farm"" from George Orwell is kind of similar."
2306,h03odc,6,"Also, “Atlas Shrugged” by Ayn Rand. I personally am not interested in her personal philosophy, but I find her books to be incredible, Atlas Shrugged really feels a lot like where we are now. Like most of the world has gone insane. What do you do when you know what’s real and cannot lie to yourself and doublethink?

“The Giver” by Lois Lowry. Really fabulous. Safety, family, and color will be forever changed. 

“The Power” by Naomi Alderman. What happens when society trades one victimized group for another? 

“A Wrinkle in Time”- this is perhaps an outlier and not a classically-defined dystopian novel, but I’d argue Camazotz is a dystopian planet. Plus, it’s one of the greatest books ever written:)"
2307,h03odc,3,I 2nd this. It's a wonderful read.
2308,h03odc,3,1985 by Anthony Burgess
2309,h03odc,6,"Yes, that's the UK title apparently."
2310,h03odc,9,"Read Brave New World recently and am partway through Fahrenheit 451. Definitely agree eith your recommendation, Brave New World portrays a different kind of dystopia and introduces many interesting ideas."
2311,h03odc,10,Brave new world revisited is also worth reading. Huxley felt compelled to ammend his efforts ad so many of his prophecys had come true within 8/10 years. When it comes to dystopian fiction there is very little that comes close to Orwell or Huxley IMO.
2312,h03odc,3,"The Iron Heel by Jack London

The audiobook on YT is amazing."
2313,h03odc,3,"The Chrysalids by John Wyndham
Lots of other great reads by him too"
2314,h03odc,3,Try Fahrenheit 451. It’s what I started on right after 1984.
2315,h03odc,15,"Yes! ""We"" is amazing. As Orwell responded to authoritarianism. Zamyatin was a bolschevik who became disillusioned with Lenin's controlling government. It apparently had such a powerful message Lenin banned it and Zamyatin and to flee the country. It was the first banned book in the Soviet Union."
2316,h03odc,8,"Just wanted to throw out some Philip K Dick, I feel like he'd fit in here"
2317,h03odc,3,I'm feeling pretty stupid right now... I didn't know they were related. I even own the book.
2318,h03odc,4,Maybe add China Miéville to that list too.
2319,h03odc,5,"I'm planning to read ""Station Eleven"", which might just be what you're looking for. It's a very recent publication, though, so not a classic like 1984."
2320,h03odc,3,"There are two books by Cory Doctorow which is a modern tech-take on dystopian current event ""future"".  Little Brother and Homeland."
2321,h03odc,3,"Swan Song by Robert McCammon

One of the best books I ever read. Life after nuclear war."

2324,h03odc,3,"Loved the movie as well. (As one as much can love a brilliantly acted but even more brilliantly depressing film, anyway.)"
2325,h03odc,3,"""A Scanner Darkly"" was unforgettable."
2326,h03odc,6,The Silo Series by Hugh Howey. The first book is called Wool and is one of my favourite books of all time. So unique.
2327,h03odc,5,Just a bit of a warning: there are a lot of books like it but it's rare to find one as good as 1984.
2328,h03odc,7,"I would also like to add *We* by Yevgeny Zamyatin to that list! Sadly often overlooked, despite being a great book."
2329,h03odc,3,This and if you love Brave New World get the Revisited edition where Huxley comments and epmhasizes points in Brave New World!!!
2330,h03odc,3,"I always felt like 1984, Brave New World, and Animal Farm should be essential readings for every person on the planet."
2331,h03odc,3,"I read that in January of this year.  Excellent book written in journal format in 1920-21, and likely the source of Huxley's and Orwell's ideas.  I borrowed the e-book on Hoopla."
2332,h03odc,3,I love The Long Walk. I’ve read it several times!
2333,h03odc,5,Also by Burgess is A Clockwork Orange and The wanting seed. The wanting seed is very dystopian with a focus on sexuality and procreation. And A Clockwork Orange while not as dystopian it is quite a bit of fun to read and comes with a dictionary of the weird language used within.
2334,h04816,3,"I go for medical memoirs when I can't concentrate because each chapter is like short story. People of the ER by Philip Allen Green, MD. Trauma Room Two, same author. Maximum Insecurity by William Wright, MD is kinda cool, written by a prison doc."
2335,h04816,7,Short story collections?
2336,h0c42f,3,"Pillars of the earth, The Nightingale, Name of the Wind"
2337,h0ejrl,35,"In Suzanne Collins’ book _Gregor the Overlander_ (first book in The Underland Chronicles), Gregor does not want to be violent or be the hero of the Underland prophecies. Throughout the series, there are candid reflections on strategy, use of force, and the impact of different types of harm. It touches on a number of adult topics in an age-appropriate way."
2338,h0ejrl,4,The Midnight Club by Christopher Pike
2339,h0ejrl,39,"Books set in Tortall by Tamora Pierce, the Alanna series are first so a good place to start."
2340,h0ejrl,15,"The Edge Chronicles by Paul Steward Chris Riddell. I still love and read them at 28. They start out with a scared boy lost in the woods. I really love the world building and illustrations as well. Nothing beats a nicely drawn map of a fantasy world.

There is little to no romance, it's all about family, friendship and adventure."
2341,h0ejrl,11,YESSS I grew up with these books (my name is Alana so I reallly loved them) and she's a badass without being stupid (for the most part)
2342,h0ejrl,4,The raven cycle by Maggie stiefvater
2343,h0ejrl,4,"The Mercedes Thompson books by Patricia Briggs, she's a coyote shifter mechanic who gets into some sticky situations but uses her head and her friends and family to get through. Some romance but its very slow burn and tasteful."
2344,h0ejrl,14,"Not YA but have you read the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett starring Rincewind the Wizard?
He is ALL ABOUT self preservation and running from danger (but still ends up saving the day some how)."
2345,h0ejrl,20,I want to say Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer
2346,h0ejrl,9,I'm gonna say The Razorland series by Ann Aguirre.
2347,h0ejrl,3,"Im listening to Outland right now and Deuces self control while trying to fit in is definitely someone not running into danger thoughtlessly.

 She's selfless but still aware."
2348,h0ejrl,5,"I love this series so much. It's a fave, and I'm 40."
2349,h0ejrl,11,The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau
2350,h0ejrl,17,"Okay, I LOVE Tamora Pierce, but her characters are notorious for getting themselves into precarious situations because they think they can handle it and then things don’t go their way. OP wants characters that don’t do that. 

Tamora Pierce’s books are well-written, have more-subtle romances, strong female leads and a variety of issues they cover, but I don’t think they fit what is being asked."
2351,h0ejrl,3,Can you use the spoilers tag and list a few situations when the characters do this? It’s been a while since I’ve read the books and I can’t think of any situations when they willingly put themselves in danger so I’m curious what you’re thinking of specifically.
2352,h0ejrl,9,"The great thing about running from danger is - even if you run into MORE danger , you can run from that too."
2353,h0ejrl,3,I absolutely adore these books and the artwork is an amazing bonus! I second this
2354,h0ejrl,3,How?
2355,h0ejrl,5,Except for Ronan
2356,h0ejrl,19,I really loved these books growing up and to this day I'm still disappointed that they made the Hunger Games into a film series but not Gregor.  Maybe one day.
2357,h0ejrl,5,"*The Hero and the Crown* by Robin McKinley 
The protagonist DOES put herself in harm's way but IMO not impulsively."
2358,h0ejrl,11,"Sabriel by Garth Nix and the sequels. The protagonist is thoughtful, rational, and when she does get into trouble its usually not due to incompetence and man, can she handle herself."
2359,h0ejrl,3,One of my fav series ever. Second this and also recommended Artemis Fowl
2360,h0ejrl,3,I recommend Garth Nix's days of the week books. I think it starts with Mister Monday.
2361,h0ejrl,25,The Host by Stephanie Meyer! Ok don’t judge by the author! I swear it’s a great book. It is Sci Fi but focuses more on the depth of human emotion and how strange it is to an outside point of view. Focuses on familial love as well friendship and romance. It’s long and the first 100 pages sometimes drag but it’s so worth it!
2362,h0ejrl,6,Try Throne Of Glass by Sarah J Maas!
2363,h0ejrl,3,"Um, I can think of at least one pretty big situation where she puts herself directly into a sketchy situation impulsively..."
2364,h0ejrl,13,Come to think of it this seems to be a Collins trademark given Katniss tries pretty hard to stay out of harm’s way too (unsuccessfully).
2365,h0ejrl,4,"Alanna is in the reckless side. I would say that Kel (Protector of the Small series) is Moore what the OP is looking for. Kel is super level headed, it's more circumstances that lead to her getting into crazy situations, not her belief in her own undefeatableness (that's not a word but you know what I mean)."
2366,h0ejrl,14,"That is a great point! Both Katniss and Gregor try to keep a low profile, keep family business at home, and step into adult responsibilities in the absence of a parent."
2367,h0ejrl,3,Loved The Host so much! Definitely a better read than Meyer's other work
2368,h0ejrl,9,I preferred Gregor to the hunger games. Every time someone brings up the hunger games I actually try to sell them on Gregor lol
2369,h0ejrl,5,"Suzanne Collins is such a baller. I’ve been re-reading a lot of the YA books I loved growing up, and hers are definitely the ones that hold up best or even improve with a second reading."
2370,h0ejrl,3,"I mean the odds that you haven’t read Enders Game are probably pretty low, but if you haven’t I’d give it a go! Its not exactly YA, definitely a more through and through sci-fi book. But Ender actively tries to avoid situations that could hurt him unless it would hurt others more if he doesn’t get involved. And even then he doesn’t view it as an empowering or liberating experience but realistically gets upset and concerned. One of the many reasons I love that book!"
2371,h0ejrl,3,"Ender's Game! Orson Scott Card is personally problematic, but his work is amazing. I think Ender's Game is incredibly respectful of children/teens and doesn't assume they'll make stupid decisions just because they're young. In fact, they generally make better decisions than the adults"
2372,h0ejrl,8,Lol if it makes you feel better I'm kinda sold on Gregor going by these 3 comments! 🤣👌
2373,h0fm40,5,The queen of Attolia series. Starts with The Theif.
2374,h0fm40,9,Fingersmith by Sarah Waters
2375,h0fm40,5,'Two Can Keep a Secret' by Karen McManus has lots of twists (some are more expected than others but that has to be expected with such an amount of twists) and there's one twist in particular that is brilliant.
2376,h0fm40,6,One of the only authors who can consistently surprise me is Kate Atkinson.
2377,h0fm40,5,"Jeffery Deaver. I love how he surprises me every time, because I too can usually predict the plot."
2378,h0fm40,12,And then there were none by agatha christie
2379,h0fm40,7,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie
2380,h0fm40,4,"The False Prince by Jennifer A. Nielson

Four Dead Queens by Astrid Scholte"
2381,h0fm40,12,"The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton. I have guessed the twists from most thriller authors\*, but definitely didn't guess this one!

\*That's not a ding on those authors; I still love reading the books!"
2382,h0fm40,5,Second this. Never saw it coming!
2383,h0fm40,3,Any graphics in the book?
2384,h0fm40,8,Death on the Nile by agatha Christie
2385,h0fm40,5,Great expectations - the plot twist is real
2386,h0fm40,5,"Scythe, 100% Scythe.

That thing was a fucking rolercoaster from start to finish, I was DYING.
In my friend group I'm known as the guy who spoils everything because I usually predict every plot twist, but that book just completely took me off guard.
On my second read everything was so obvious."
2387,h0fm40,3,The Silent Patient and The Woman in the Window
2388,h0fm40,5,"The first book in The Pines series by Blake Crouch game me massive goosebumps as I was reading through a final sequence, truly a jaw-dropping experience. 
I heard some people say that they could somehow guess at the ending, but in my case, suspense and mystery permeating the story kept me so tight in their grip that I had no time to theoritize on anything, the pacing is just so good in this one."
2389,h0fm40,9,Dark Places by Gillian Flynn
2390,h0fm40,3,"The Red Rising series by Pierce Brown has recently become one of my very favorite book series in recent memory. If you like science fiction with suspenseful action, then you’d really enjoy this series. The first book is a lot like a mix of the Hunger Games and Ender’s Game but the series eventually evolves into a space opera with tons of twists and turns."
2391,h0fm40,3,Hard Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World by Haruki Murakami
2392,h0fm40,4,YES. I was looking for this one
2393,h0fm40,3,I was so confused for a minute and then I realised they changed the title for the American publishing of this.
2394,h0fm40,3,Agatha Christie gets me every time.  I can never guess her twists and they always feel surprising yet inevitable.  And then they were none is my favorite
2395,h0fm40,3,Third this.
2396,h0fm40,3,Agatha Christie is the queen of the plot twist
2397,h0fm40,3,The Silent Patient!!!
2398,h0fm40,3,We Were Liars by E. Lockhart
2399,h0hl8o,5,"If you want short stories, I recommend Men Without Women or After The Quake. If you want a good, normal length story, I’d say After Dark or Kafka On The Shore. If you want epic, then 1Q84. (One of my faves is his non fiction book on running, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. Very philosophical and a good insight into his mind)"
2400,h0hl8o,3,"I have read five of his books, I read them in Spanish so I don't know the titles in English (you could Google them of) but my recommendation about how to start is:

- Sputnik (best to start IMO)
- Colorless Tsukuru
- Norwegian Wood
- After the earthquake
- Kafka on the Shore (worst to start IMO) 

Among them, Kafka is the best book but I think it'd be a bad decision to start with it. It's more complex and long than the others."
2401,h0hl8o,5,"I find his books are slow to wind up, but I do enjoy them.  Norwegian Wood is an easy one.  Wind Up Bird Chronicles would probably not be the best to start with."
2402,h0hl8o,3,Much appreciated!
2403,h0hl8o,3,"Be aware that it's often magical realism, everyman protagonist, cats, weird sex, weird lesbianism"
2404,h0hl8o,3," If you want to dive headfirst into it, I would definitely recommend you read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle first. Top notch Murakami! His short stories are also very enjoyable, especially Samsa in Love, which is one of the best short stories I have read so far."
2405,h0hl8o,3,"Follow this order 

Norwegian wood, Kafka on the shore, the wind up bird chronicle, a wild sheep chase, dance dance dance, after dark, colorless tsuzuru tazaki and his years of pilgrimage, after the quake, sputnik sweetheart, hard boiled wonderland and the end of the world, 1Q84 and finally read Hear the wind sing/Pinball 1973. Skip killing commendatore"
2406,h0hl8o,5,No love for After Dark in here? I liked that one a lot.
2407,h0i7vp,3,Check out The Hyperion Cantos! Absolutely amazing set of books!
2408,h0i7vp,12,Dark Matter by Blake Crouch!
2409,h0i7vp,5,Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan
2410,h0i7vp,3,It indeed reads like a thriller^^
2411,h0i7vp,3,Murderbot for sure!
2412,h0jiv4,12,"Louis L’Amour, basically anything by Louis L’Amour, but his Jubal Sackett series might be the ticket. 

Zane Grey is another writer you could look at for reading material. Maybe try Riders of the Purple Sage."
2413,h0jiv4,4,"Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian is a pretty horrifying but utterly excellent book. Hard recommend. 

Or Lonesome Dove, which is problematic but a classic western."
2414,h0jiv4,6,You could try Stephen King’s The Gunslinger which is the first in his ‘The Dark Tower’ series. It’s Western fused with sci-fi if that’s something you’re interested in
2415,h0jiv4,6,"Doc/Epitaph duology (Mary Doria Russell)

The Sisters Brothers (Patrick deWitt)

The Shootist (Glendon Swarthout)

And it’s not Old West, but I think The Good Lord Bird (James McBride) would do you just fine.

Edit: also most of James Carlos Blake’s stuff."
2416,h0jiv4,4,"Blood Meridian (Cormac McCarthy)

The sisters brothers (DeWitt)

True Grit (Charles Portis)

Assassinations of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford (Ron Hansen)"
2417,h0jiv4,3,I just finished True Grit and it’s stupendous.
2418,h0jiv4,3,Louis L’Amour is a great western writer for new readers
2419,h0jiv4,5,"I'll second True Grit. Quick read, lots of action, surprisingly emotional."
2420,h0jiv4,5,"Blood Meridian is an AWFUL book for someone who's new to reading. It's good, but very difficult"
2421,h0jiv4,3,Lonesome Dove
2422,h0jiv4,3,Valdez is Coming was great.
2423,h0jiv4,3,This is the obvious choice here.
2424,h0lwoi,9,House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski
2425,h0lwoi,3,"The Library at Mount Char was the weirdest, funniest, darkest contemporary fantasy I’ve ever read. It was seriously incredible, totally addictive despite (or because of?) all the oddity. Highly recommended!!"
2426,h0lwoi,12,The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a weird one
2427,h0lwoi,5,"Horrorstor by Grady Hendrix - gory/funny/horror that takes place in an Ikea ripoff store. The format is great too, like an Ikea catalog

John Dies at the End by David Wong - -psychadelic/fantasy/horror also funny and so super weird. The movie is truly fantastic as well."
2428,h0lwoi,15,"Perfume: the Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind

nobody can top this in my mind"
2429,h0lwoi,5,"A lot of Philip K Dick stuff is pretty out there. He loves themes like alternate realities, simulacra, mind altering substances, mental illness...it gets weird fast."
2430,h0lwoi,4,1Q84. It was strange
2431,h0lwoi,9,Naked Lunch.. House of Leaves too
2432,h0lwoi,7,"*Kafka on the Shore* by Haruki Murakami

*The Vegetarian* by Han Kang

*The Autumn of Patriarch* by Gabrial Garcia Marquez"
2433,h0lwoi,3,Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath by H.P Lovecraft
2434,h0lwoi,5,1Q84 is brilliant.  And weird.  But mostly brilliant.
2435,h0lwoi,4,"The Three Body Problem is a Chinese science fiction novel by Liu Cixin, translated into English.  The translator balances Chinese and western literary forms, trying to stay true to the source while making it palatable to western audiences.  It is trippy and seems like completely magical thinking, but everything ends up having a reasonable explanation in the end.  It takes some getting used to (definitely some culture shock in terms of character motivation, etc), but by the end it is kind of brilliant."
2436,h0lwoi,3,The Iluminatus trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea
2437,h0lwoi,4,"Geek Love

The Whipping Star

In Watermelon Sugar

Annihilation

... weird AND good"
2438,h0lwoi,4,Perdido Street Station by China Mieville.
2439,h0lwoi,3,I wouldn't recommend a book I didnt like.. but the weirdest book I actually enjoyed was the ocean at the end of the lane. Hella trippy but kindof magical.
2440,h0lwoi,4,Came here to say this (Naked Lunch) - William Burroughs for people looking for the author.
2441,h0lwoi,3,Geek Love +1
2442,h0pbo5,3,I recently read the History of Love by Nicole Krauss. It is now one of my favorite books and meets your requests.
2443,h0pbo5,3,"1632 - Eric Flint.     
Conquistador - SM Stirling     
Alien Taste - Wen Spencer.   
Agent of Change - Lee &amp; Miller."
2444,h0pbo5,10,"I’m not into romance much but Pillars of Earth by Ken follett had some. Took a little bit to get to the big part of it though. It revolves around the building of a cathedral in the 12th century.

Edit: it does have some graphic parts so just a heads up if that’s not your thing."
2445,h0pbo5,4,I was going to recommend this one but you beat me to it! Excellent choice. ☺
2446,h0pbo5,5,Spinning Silver or Uprooted by Naomi Novik. Both are really excellent reads that I think fit the bill!
2447,h0pbo5,3,"Don’t consider Spinning Silver a sequel in any way. The stories themselves aren’t interconnected at all. They have very similar structures and styles and fairytale like feels but they don’t actually go together like a book one and a book two. 

That said, I loved Uprooted when I read it, and then I loved Spinning Silver even more."
2448,h0s1qw,5,Old Man's War by John Scalzi.
2449,h0s1qw,3,"The Hunger Games were unputdownable for me, I read the first one during a weekend and then went out and bought the other two and read them really fast. But that's dystopian YA with some romance thrown in.

For romance, something light and fun like Jennifer Crusie's writing (my faves are Faking It and Welcome To Temptation) or Jenny Colgan could work.

I have some thriller book recs that I read in a day but if you're a very young teen I don't think they'll be good for you, I didn't like thrillers as a teen and found them disturbing in many ways."
2450,h0s1qw,3,"try radio silence by alice oseman, i loved it!"
2451,h0s1qw,3,Born a Crime by Trevor Noah
2452,h0sb7o,5,"I am Mixed by Garcelle Beauvais and Sebastian Jones might be worth adding to your collection. Also, if you have Instagram the page booksfordiversity is excellent! I think you’ll find some good suggestions there."
2453,h0xflg,3,"Skyward by Brandon Sanderson is the best YA series I've ever read. Normally I don't enjoy YA because I find most books shallow and superficial, with a half decent story and a corny romance, but trust me when I tell you that Skyward is GOOD."
2454,h0xflg,4,"I’m 49 and have been an avid reader since grade school. YA books are some of my favorites. They’re engaging, fast paced, they generally don’t have so many characters that you can’t keep track of them. Sure, they aren’t written in a style that is achingly beautiful, like “All the Light We Cannot See”, or “The Kite Runner”. But they tell great stories and have relatable characters and are generally FUN to read. I second the recommendation of the Six of Crows series. And for a throwback from my youth, the Dragonriders of Pern books are also quite good. I also think that everyone should read “Down With The Shine” by Kate Karyus Quinn, because it is absurdly funny."

2470,h7kmfr,3,Wouldn't this be sort of a spoiler though?
2471,h7kmfr,5,That one’s complicated
2472,h7sx3n,4,"OK, so this is not a collection of short stories, but it's a fun book with short chapters. It's called *Time Cat* by Lloyd Alexander. It's about a boy whose cat can time travel. Each chapter is a different time period they visit, so they're very discrete sections. Each one is a little like a short story in that way."
2473,h7sx3n,4,"Ted Chiang, his short stories are awesome!"
2474,h7sx3n,3,Ray Bradbury is fantastic! check out The Illustrated Man and the Martian Chronicles
2475,h7sx3n,3,"Flannery O’Conner’s short stories, Bruce Chatwin’s books ( they have insanely short chapters), maybe just get into poetry rather than bothering with prose? It’s often far more complex and challenging than a story and way easier to get into and mull over.


Maybe try some Maya Angelou, George Herbert, Robert Frost, John Donne, Sylvia Plath?

Edit: oh yeah, Douglas Adams might work for you - he goes in all sorts of different directions!"
2476,h7sx3n,4,"There's a collection published yearly called ""The Best American Short Stories"" and that can be a good way to find authors you like.  

Also, if you like humor David Sedaris can be a lot of fun."

2479,h7sx3n,3,"Brandon Sandersons novellas. I've also got ADHD but I find his 'cosmere' stuff (and his general writing style) enough to keep me interested. 

I do have a habit of blasting thru the larger books, then reading the wiki, then rereading specific chapters to sort of...relive the stuff I blasted through in excerpts"
2480,h7sx3n,4,"As a fellow adhd person, really recommend audio books dude. It's so much easier to get through books that way because you don't have to stay focused constantly and you don't miss as much as you'd expect."
2481,h7sx3n,3,"Snapshots was equally good, and also quite short.  It held me all the way to the end (and requires no prior reading by him)."
2482,h7sx3n,3,Time Cat is super fun! I highly recommend reading middle grade books like this. They’re often written for 9-12 year olds but as an adult with ADHD (and someone who works in a library) I enjoy reading them the most.
2483,h7sx3n,3,And the Bachman books. His short stories are awesome.
2484,h7sx3n,3,"Totally. The Long Walk is, even after 30 years, still one of my favorite short stories of all time."

Voices from Chernobyl (Svetlana Alexievich)

Notes From Underground (Dostoyevsky) - also: Crime and Punishment"
2491,hqyex4,3,How are Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky not mentioned yet? 😁
2492,hqyex4,6,"_A Hero of Our Time_, by Mikhail Lermontov - the work that popularised the ""superfluous man"" character type in Russian prose.

I'd recommend _Young Doctor's Notebook_ by Mikhail Bulgakov - it's a semi-fictional diary of a semi-fictional young doctor who had just been assigned to work in a remote village in Russia. It's mostly light-hearted, but also a bit autobiographical, as Bulgakov himself was a trained doctor. Also _Heart of a Dog_ - that book was less than warmly received by the Soviet authorities, which should be enough reason to give it a go, but it is a good book in its own right, a satire of the revolution and its attempt to fix the whole population just like that.

Ivan Turgenev's short stories (or novellas?) also deserve a read (or two; or every year): ""First Love"", ""Diary of a Superfluous Man"", and ""Asya"" are my favourites.

Can't pass without recommending Strugatsky brothers: ""Monday Begins on Saturday"", if you're into a whimsical ""socialism as utopia"" type of thing; ""Roadside Picnic"", if you're into pondering on the meaning of life, humans' place in the universe, nature of happiness, etc; ""Doomed City"", if you'd like to see a man grow from an idealistic young communist into whatever he becomes in the end; ""Hard to be a God"", if you're wondering what secret agents from 22nd century Earth would do on a medieval planet. Seriously, I can't recommend Strugatsky brothers enough. There's also ""Noon: 22nd century"", which is a collection of short stories, but it's most likely out of print and harder to find nowadays. Everything else has recently been translated again, so no problem in supply there."
2493,hqyex4,4,One of my favorites is Fathers and Sons - Ivan Turgenev. the russians make the best authors
2494,hqyex4,3,The Bear and the Nightingale (Winternight Trilogy)
2495,hqyu74,10,The Harry Dresden series is awesome. It a mix of the real world with the magic. The first two books are really cool they have a noir feel but book 3 the series hits overdrive. This is probably one of my personal favorites
2496,hqyu74,3,"An Unkindness of Magicians by Kat Howard

All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders

...and for a sweet bit of hearth magic, try ....

The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden"
2497,hqyu74,7,The Raven Cycle series by Maggie Stiefvater!!! It captures the sense of wonder about magic and the characters are amazing
2498,hqyu74,5,Have you tried the Rogers of London series by Ben Aaronovich? Centres around a magical crime division as part of the metropolitan police force.
2499,hqyu74,6,"A great series is one called Rivers of London by Ben Aaronovitch. About a London policeman becoming the apprentice to a wizard who is head of the police department dealing with magical disturbances. It has really in depth descriptions of learning magic and the process of crafting and casting spells, making it feel more like something you study rather than something are born with."
2500,hqyu74,5,"If you liked The Magicians trilogy, you might enjoy The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins. It’s modern fantasy and has the same kind of dark vibe that Grossman’s books had, as well as their kind of dry/dark humor."
2501,hqyu74,3,Came here to say this!
2502,hqyu74,15,"Anything by Neil Gaiman, particularly Neverwhere or The Ocean at the End of the Lane, or Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern"
2503,hqyu74,5,"The Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud, for sure"
2504,hqyu74,4,Try The Broken Earth trilogy by NK Jemisin. It’s sci-fi/fantasy and set in a post climate change world. Completely different story/plot than any fantasy I’ve recently read but the same elements that make me love the genre
2505,hqyu74,7,Can’t recommend Ocean at the End of the Lane enough. It’s a genuine masterpiece
2506,hqyu74,3,"Two of my absolute favorite books I've read this year have been about this. 

The Cities We Became by N.K. Jemisin is a fantastic, beautiful book that explores and subverts the themes of Lovecraft, while exploring magic in an urban setting in a way that feels very different from typical urban fantasy. It's also beautifully written and extremely powerful. The only problem I have recommending it is that it is the first book in a (yet unreleased) trilogy, and I'm impatient. 

The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix Harrow is also fantastic. If you like portal fantasy (much like The Magicians) this is one of the best examples of it I've read in years. It's also fantastically well written, and deserves all the praise and attention it's been getting.

Magic for Liars by Sarah Gailey might also work well for you. It's a murder mystery, but set in a school for magic, with a non-magical, hard boiled detective trying to solve the crime while coming to terms with their own personal relationship to the world of magic. And it's by Sarah Gailey, so it's extremely well written and beautifully inclusive."
2507,hqyu74,5,Night circus is such a rich book. The sounds and tastes and feelings described make you feel utterly immersed.
2508,hqyu74,3,"Totally agree, it’s like reading a dream"
2509,hqyu74,3,NINTH HOUSE!!!! 👌👌👌
2510,hqyu74,3,"Mrs Peregrins home for peculiar children by Ransom Riggs. Don’t judge it by that travesty of a movie. I’ve not read the lastest two but the first three books are very very like Harry Potter with a bunch of kids in a secret building full of magic that weaves in and out of the real world. They are fantastic and very complex.

The mortal instruments series. A lot of it is a bit simple but they are still good and they have the mixture of real world.magic world you are looking for.

A Discovery of Witches. Way more adult but it does teeter between the real world and a sort of magical world.

Not real world but still have elements you are looking for:

The Tiffany Aching series by Terry Pratchett not really set in the real world but I found it felt very Harry Potter like. It’s technically a part of the Discworld novels (another series I recommend)

Od Magic by Patricia McKillip (the Riddle Master of Hed is pretty good too). Od magic is sort like if there was a book about a character that was sort of a combination of Hagrid/Luna/Neville. 

Abhorsen series by Nix. It’s a series I’ve only read the first three. Still strong magical elements that are a bit dark.

The realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb it isn’t is exactly like what you want but it has a bit of everything. They are the best fantasy series I’ve ever read on several levels."
2511,hqyu74,3,Love NK Jemisin! I found out about her through the LeVar Burton Reads podcast
2512,hqywh8,3,"Annie on my mind is a classic but to be frank I can't remember how it ends. If it had a sad ending I would remember that though, so give it a try"
2513,hqywh8,3,Juliet Takes a Breath by Gabby Rivera
2514,hqz5jj,176,Circe and The Song of Achilles by Madeleine Miller (retellings of classic myths)
2515,hqz5jj,11,The Silence of the Girls - Pat Barker
2516,hqz5jj,31,"Greek Myths Retold, *Stephen Fry*"
2517,hqz5jj,9,"Cassandra by Christa Wolf, it's a bit older (1983) but it tells the story of the Trojan War from Cassandra's (the prophet) point of view."
2518,hqz5jj,46,"Circe by Madeline Mirror, The Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood, Alcestis by Katherine Beutner!"
2519,hqz5jj,54,"Just read Circe, and I second the recommendation! Beautiful storytelling."
2520,hqz5jj,9,A bit more abstractly - but Fates and Furies by Lauren Groff
2521,hqz5jj,5,"The Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne. It's a already completed series of 9 books with random novellas and interludes, and a satisfyingending. I can not reccomend them enough."
2522,hqz5jj,3,"[**Lord of the Silver Bow (Troy, #1)**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257149.Lord_of_the_Silver_Bow)

^(By: David Gemmell | 483 pages | Published: 2005 | Popular Shelves: historical-fiction, fiction, historical, mythology, default | )[^(Search ""Lord of the Silver Bow by David Gemmell"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Lord of the Silver Bow by David Gemmell&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;He is a man of many names. Some call him the Golden One; others, the Lord of the Silver Bow. To the Dardanians, he is Prince Aeneas. But to his friends, he is Helikaon. Strong, fast, quick of mind, he is a bold warrior, hated by his enemies, feared even by his Trojan allies. For there is a darkness at the heart of the Golden One, a savagery that, once awakened, can be appeased only with blood.
&gt;
&gt;Argurios the Mykene is a peerless fighter, a man of unbending principles and unbreakable will. Like all of the Mykene warriors, he lives to conquer and to kill. Dispatched by King Agamemnon to scout the defenses of the golden city of Troy, he is Helikaon's sworn enemy.
&gt;
&gt;Andromache is a priestess of Thera betrothed against her will to Hektor, prince of Troy. Scornful of tradition, skilled in the arts of war, and passionate in the ways of her order, Andromache vows to love whom she pleases and to live as she desires.
&gt;
&gt;Now fate is about to thrust these three together; and, from the sparks of passionate love and hate, ignite a fire that will engulf the world.
&gt;
&gt;Readers who know the works of David Gemmell expect nothing less than excellence from this author, whose taut prose, driving plots, and full-bodied characters have won him legions of fans the world over. Now, with this first masterly volume in an epic reimagining of the Trojan War, Gemmell has written an ageless drama of brave deeds and fierce battles, of honor and treachery, of love won and lost.

2523,hqz5jj,3,Fifteen Dogs by André Alexis
2524,hqz5jj,8,"Someone mentioned Circe, and I second that motion."
2525,hqz5jj,51,"The Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood. A retelling of the Odyssey from Penelope's perspective. Be warned of some heavy themes, even though I would classify the book itself as light."
2526,hqz5jj,9,Those were both quite good.
2527,hqz5jj,3,"See Mary Renault's work, starting with ""the Bull from the Sea."" Her historical fiction about Alexander the Great is great too, was said to be President Kennedy's favorite."
2528,hqz5jj,12,"I second everyone suggesting Madeline Miller’s Circe and Song of Achilles! Not modern in terms of setting, though, but definitely a modern perspective. Also there’s the graphic novel Greek Street, very loose retellings in a modern setting, pretty cool."
2529,hqz5jj,7,Red Rising by Pierce Brown
2530,hqz5jj,16,Star Crossed series by Josephine Angelini. I was over the moon for that series
2531,hqz5jj,22,Mythos and Heroes both by Stephen Fry.
2532,hqz5jj,4,"*Mythos* by Stephen Fry is a modern retelling of a bunch of classic Greek myths. He also wrote a sequel called *Heroes* that I haven't read yet personally but have heard good things about and a third one's on the way called *Troy* which, just as the name implies, is going to be a deep dive into the mythology surrounding the battle of Troy"
2533,hqz5jj,19,Read them both and I'd totally recommend it! They were amazing.
2534,hqz5jj,64,American Gods by Neil Gaiman is pretty stinking excellent. Various mythologies (not just Greek) in modern America!
2535,hqz5jj,6,Anne carson - autobiography of red
2536,hqz5jj,11,God's behaving badly by Marie phillips
2537,hqz5jj,4,How is that Greek mythology
2538,hqz5jj,5,Cannot recommend Stephen Fry's 'Mythos' and 'Heroes' enough! Fry's writing is just wonderful
2539,hqz5jj,11,Is it better to read song of Achilles first? I have circe but I'm not sure it would matter if i read them out of order
2540,hqz5jj,10,*Till We Have Faces* by C.S. Lewis is a beautiful retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth.
2541,hqz5jj,30,"I don’t think it matters, some characters cross over but they are different stories. Circe is a sprawling, generations-long saga and SOA is a more contained story. I read SOA first and love it more than Circe... but both are great!"
2542,hqz5jj,4,Thank you!
2543,hqz5jj,4,"If you're into YA, Summer of the Mariposas by Guadalupe Garcia McCall is a wonderful reimagining of The Odyssey."
2544,hqz5jj,5,It’s inspired by Greek/roman mythology
2545,hqz5jj,3,"If you are interested in a bit of light-hearted comedy and more mythologies, like Aztec and Sumerian:  Zeus Grants Stupid Wishes: A No-Bullshit Guide to World Mythology by Cory O'Brien. It is hilarious!"
2546,hqz5jj,3,"Gods behaving badly, cant remember who by. Technically a romcom I think which I normally don't enjoy, but this was absolutely hilarious. Premise is that the ancient greek pantheon are living in a dingy flat in london, and their powers have waned as people stopped worshipping them. Hilarious inter-God dynamics and a sweet story to boot. Highly recommend"
2547,hqz5jj,7,The Secret History. It has themes of Greek mythology and centers on characters who study classics in college.
2548,hqz5jj,3,Cassandra by Christa Wolf.  A beautiful book that has stayed with me over the years.
2549,hqz5jj,3,The Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood
2550,hqz5jj,4,"[The Immortals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25746707-the-immortals), by Jordanna Max Brodsky!"
2551,hqz5jj,3,"The Lovely War. It’s technically set in WWII, but it’s told by Greek Gods including Aphrodite, Ares, and Hades"
2552,hqz5jj,17,The audiobook read by the man himself is such a joy to listen to.
2553,hqz5jj,7,I read Circe first. It really doesn’t matter as there are very few characters that cross over
2554,hqz5jj,17,He has another one called Heroes. Both are great.
2555,hqz5jj,20,"It’s been awhile, but I don’t believe it has Greek mythology at all, other than passing references."
2556,hqz5jj,11,"More Norse, I’d say."
2557,hqz5jj,6,"I was going to suggest American Gods by Neil Gaiman (as suggested by others) but the Greek Gods aren't included - it's the ""Old Gods"" which is a mix of Egyptian, Norse, Slavic, etc.

For Greek Gods: Who Let the Gods Out by Maz Evans (there are a few) and they are a suuuuper easy read"
2558,hqz5jj,11,"Yep also has Egyptian, American Indian, Hindu, Slavic and West African"
2559,hqz5jj,3,Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis
2560,hqz5jj,6,The play Euridyce by Sarah Ruhl. Tells the story of Orpheus from Euridyce's perspective.
2561,hqz5jj,13,"Additionally, Neil wrote a book called Norse Mythology that is quite lovely."
2562,hqz5jj,7,Ilium by Dan Simmons and its sequel are awesome. Slightly comedic and erotic Greek sci-fi..
2563,hqz5jj,4,"Any of Anne Carson’s translations of Greek plays (Antigonick, Grief Lessons), Autobiography of Red, Red Doc&gt;. Louise Glück’s Averno has some poetic retellings. Madeline Miller’s Circe and Song of Achilles."
2564,hqz5jj,4,"The Thessaly Trilogy by Jo Walton. Honestly some of the best literature I've ever read, it's sort of about Plato's Republic but many of the Greek gods are characters and Walton's fresh take on the Greek pantheon is very thought provoking."
2565,hqz5jj,3,"Yes! And just go ahead and read Eros the Bittersweet and then imprint on Anne Carson, high priestess of volcanos and margin spacing like an infant icebat"
2566,hqz5jj,6,"Even if it doesn't apply to the question, you are doing OP a favor by recommending this series. Best book series I've ever read."
2567,hqz5jj,4,"He took the idea that post-humans will be like Greek gods, and ran with it."
2568,hqz5jj,3,"Yes, this one is an excellent recommendation,"
2569,hqz5jj,3,"Well, a webcomic called Lore Olympus.."
2570,hqz5jj,5,"Not a book, but a WEBTOON. Lore Olympus is great, it’s a modern retelling of Persephone and Hades."
2571,hqz5jj,4,"Lavinia by Usula K LeGuin.

And if you’ve never picked up the OG classic, the Metamorphoses by Ovid is probably my favorite book ever. The Charles Martin translation is very good. Not modern, but it’s absolutely gorgeous."
2572,hqz5jj,7,"I've read Circe twice this year, I love it so much 🥰"
2573,hqz5jj,5,"I sobbed when I finished SOA. Straight full tears. So beautiful. I’m halfway through Circe and the writing just pulls me back into that world.

Highly recommend those two books."
2574,hqz5jj,4,Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward. It’s the story of a young pregnant girl in Southern Mississippi during Hurricane Katrina. It is one of the few books I know of that relates Greek myths to the stories of modern Black characters.
2575,hqz5jj,11,I’m reading mythos right now. Pretty good!
2576,hqz5jj,3,If you want more of a cheesy YA romance take on it goddess test is pretty good. It’s not a huge serious novel but the kind of book that’s nice to unwind with
2577,hqz5jj,7,"Hmmmmm.... that’s up to you. I read The Iliad back in college, so I knew broad strokes going into it. That added a nice element of dramatic irony. But I don’t think it’s completely necessary. 

The Iliad is long and dense, while SOA is page turner, written in simple language with strong emotion. I think it could be enjoyed going in blind. Basically, you’re asking “should I barrel through 1000 pages of blank verse Homer before reading a beautiful 300-page novel?” And the answer to that depends on your interest level in Classics. If that sounds like a fun crash course, cool! Dive in. BUT maybe SOA could humanize the characters for you first and give you a readable take on the Trojan War events BEFORE you delve into Homer."
2578,hqz5jj,3,"Highly, HIGHLY, recommend the audiobook versions. Helps with the pronunciations and they’re just amazing voice actors."
2579,hqz5jj,3,"I really enjoyed The Moon Riders when I was that age. It is by an author called Theresa Tomlinson and follows a 14 year old who becomes an Amazon and makes friends with Cassandra of Troy.

There is a second book called Voyage of the Snake Lady.

Just if you're looking for more ideas of what she can read next."
2580,hqz5jj,3,"Although it doesn’t have actual depictions of Greek gods, the modern take on a pantheon and the ways in which the gods interfere in the lives of mortals is absolutely consistent with those types of mythologies, including Greek.  So this absolutely would, I think, scratch that itch."
2581,hqz5jj,5,"Till We Have Faces by CS Lewis. Not quite modern but it’s a beautiful retelling of the story of Cupid &amp; Psyche.  Tells a tale of 2 sisters with a strong bond, until the younger is sacrificed to a beast. 

Paints a beautiful moral of the inability to identify one’s selfishness, and the idea that even when you are convinced you are right, your reality is not always someone else’s and that is something you need to respect."
2582,hqz5jj,3,I’m sure no one on this subreddit has rad it but I found this book randomly in BAM The Shadow Prince by Bree Despain. It’s a young adult series but I liked it 😊
2583,hqz5jj,3,"Lavinia by Ursula K Leguin. There are lots of recommendations in this thread already and several of them are excellent but please, please take the time to read Lavinia!"
2584,hqz5jj,3,Me too! I’m reading it now and it’s surprising Ares and even Hades aren’t jerks. 😂
2585,hqz5jj,8,"Just to confirm, I did go into SOA blind and enjoyed it very much!"
2586,hqz5jj,3,"Wait wait wait, I feel like an absolute idiot because I had no idea Circe was a modern take. I've been avoiding it because Greek mythology isn't really my thing. I prefer to stay in this Century. But a modern take changes everything and sounds cool as hell. There i go judging a book by the cover (front and back I should add). Nobody's perfect lol"
2587,hr09ia,3,"I’d give George Orwell a read, 1984, animal farm, Homage to Catalonia. Blood lands and black earth by timothy snyder."
2588,hr09ia,3,"To give you something about colonialism and racism, which is also heavily studied by Arendt, I would suggest ""Discourse on Colonialism"" by Aimé Cesaire and ""The Wretched of the Earth"" by Frantz Fanon."
2589,hr09ia,3,+1 to Wretched of the Earth
2590,hr1v0v,3,Loved the book. Perhaps it is timeto reread it.
2591,hr1v0v,6,I would recommend checking out any Neil Gaiman or Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke
2592,hr1v0v,3,Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor
2593,hr1v0v,3,"This is my favorite book of all time! I would love to see other suggestions as well, I need something to fill the void in my heart now that I’ve read this one 3+ times."
2594,hr1v0v,3,"Have you read Erin Morgenstern's new book, The Starless Sea? It's a totally different story, but has the same feeling as The Night Circus."
2595,hr31uo,3,"Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell would be a great one! It is history-ish but with an alternate path for England. Very in depth writing, super complex. You must read all the footnotes to get the full scope of the story. It is one of the best books I've read."
2596,hr31uo,3,"Dorothy Dunnett wrote two convoluted historical series, pretty dense but a lot of fun if you get into it. You could read the first Lymond book as a stand alone, it's called The Game of Kings. She also wrote a novel around MacBeth called King Hereafter which is not a part of a series."
2597,hr31uo,5,Sara Donati’s Wilderness Series is officially recommended by the author of Outlander. 🙂
2598,hr5ftg,28,"If you’re a fan of science fiction, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (and the whole series) by Douglas Adams is full of sarcastic and witty humor."
2599,hr5ftg,3,Maybe books by Jonas Jonasson?
2600,hr5ftg,18,Me talk pretty one day. Or any David Sedaris book
2601,hr5ftg,6,Anything by Augustun Burroughs.
2602,hr5ftg,3,Good omens or John dies at the end. But the latter isn’t focused on comedy as much as the former
2603,hr5ftg,11,"Christopher Moore usually has a direct route to my funny home with most of his books but I’d suggest Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Friend."
2604,hr5ftg,13,Yes! Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett also has the same vibe imo.
2605,hr5ftg,9,Terry Pratchett - Mort
2606,hr5ftg,3,Believe it or not some of Charles Dickens’ books are really funny; reminds me of Curb Your Enthusiasm. The Pickwick Papers is hilarious.
2607,hr5ftg,4,A Dirty Job by Christopher Moore is a favorite.
2608,hr5ftg,4,Anything by Dave Barry
2609,hr5ftg,3,Good omens. Aka the best book ever
2610,hr5ftg,3,Anything by Terry Pratchett makes me laugh a lot
2611,hr5ftg,5,Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) by Jerome K Jerome
2612,hr5ftg,3,"Christopher Moore. My favorites are Fool, The Serpent of Venice, A Dirty Job, and Second Hand Souls. He is fantastic at creating emotions, whether it is making you laugh out loud or choke back a tear."
2613,hr5ftg,9,The Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich!
2614,hr5ftg,9,A Confederacy of Dunces
2615,hr5ftg,4,"A Confederacy of Dunces is an all-timer. 
Catch-22 is very funny.
The Last Days of Summer, and Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About, were lesser known but cracked me up throughout."
2616,hr5ftg,11,"David sedaris is hilarious. Bonus- If you like audiobooks, he reads all of his own books and it makes the writing even funnier."
2617,hr5ftg,3,"The entire Discworld serie by Terry Pratchett

Wilt by Tom Sharpe - this one had me laughing so hard sometimes that I had to take a break before I could continue"
2618,hr5ftg,5,"Anything by P. G. Wodehouse 

Catch-22

2622,hr5ftg,3,Y’know I couldn’t get into it
2623,hr5ftg,3,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
2624,hr5ftg,3,“A Walk in the Woods” by Bill Bryson!
2625,hr5ftg,4,Hyperbole and a half is my favorite if I need a laugh.
2626,hr5ftg,3,"These are incredible, especially since they aren't too hard to read. I've been able to read most of the books in her 20+ book series across about the past 10 years. They all follow a similar formula and they're all just hilarious. Though one content warning about Lula's history which is a little dark, but that's in the beginning, the first book or two I think."
2627,hr5ftg,4,Surely you’re joking Mr. Feynman!
2628,hr5ftg,3,"Out of season, but The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson. 

And for something completely different...when I was a kid I found The Saint stories by Leslie Charteris to be hilarious, especially the early ones. I'm not sure what I'd think of them now."
2629,hr5ftg,10,Jenny Lawson. She writes about life growing up in Texas and mental heath and is hilarious about everything.
2630,hr5ftg,4,Lamb
2631,hr5ftg,4,I was going to say the same
2632,hr5ftg,4,I used to listen to her books on my commute. I’d be sitting at the light screaming with laughter or crying. Can’t wait to visit her book store in San Antonio.
2633,hr5ftg,3,He’s the reason I figured out I have aspergers...
2634,hr5ftg,4,Anything by Bryson
2635,hr5ftg,3,Youth in revolt
2636,hr5ftg,3,I am re-reading the “Thunderbolt Kid” right now and will literally be tears-in-my-eyes laughing out loud at times.  This one and “In a Sunburnt Country” are amazing and hilarious.
2637,hr5ftg,5,I had to buy a second copy of Lamb because I read it and lent it to so many people the cover fell off. It’s hands down one of my top 5 favorite books and makes me laugh every time.

I hope you‘ll find something you like and happy reading! :)"
2646,hr7ifp,5,The passage trilogy by Justin Cronin.
2647,hr7ifp,9,Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel. Disturbing and redeeming and makes you appreciate all the day-to-day things we take for granted (and the fact that COVID-19 is horrifying but not as fatal as it could’ve been).
2648,hr7ifp,9,The girl with all the gifts
2649,hr7ifp,3,"Dark Eden by Chris Beckett is a great book that tells the story of the children of two stranded space travelers who form a new society solely based on the knowledge/beliefs provided by the two space travelers. It's a super interesting look at societal influence on beliefs, and not supernatural in any way.

Cell by Stephen King is also an interesting take on zombie stories."
2650,hr7ifp,5,Second that. First one was a masterpiece and loved the third one too
2651,hr7ifp,3,"An older book and a good, quick read (with some supernatural elements): The Chrysalids by John Wyndham"
2652,hr7ifp,5,"Read Fahrenheit 451! It’s a dystopian must read. 

Edit: And it’s very relevant

[wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451)"
2653,hr7ifp,9,"World War Z is a zombie book but it’s intelligent and thoughtful. It explores the social, political and military response to a zombie outbreak. 

Lucifer’s Hammer by Larry Niven

Dies the Fire by SM Stirling

Seveneves by Neal Stephenson

Alas Babylon by Pat Frank"
2654,hr7ifp,6,"Came here to mention the Unwind series. It really is an amazing series, in my opinion."
2655,hr7ifp,3,Try a utopian trilogy gone wrong. The Scythe series by Neal Shusterman
2656,hr7ifp,3,Earth Abides
2657,hr7ifp,3,"Roadside Picnic (Arkady Strugatsky, Boris Strugatsky) Certain areas in the world are changed at the molecular level due to an alien visit. All items in these areas become highly valuable and men called “stalkers” illegally cross into these zones to sell the items inside braving all the dangers that these “zones” carry with them. Not really doing it justice here but it’s Cold War era Soviet science fiction. Great read and pretty short as well."
2658,hr7ifp,3,"World War Z was such a good read, highly recommend.I was never fan of zombie fiction but this book was , as you said, a good insight in how world would react in case of some...pandemic?"
2659,hr7ifp,4,I highly recommend Brave New World. It’s such an intriguing contrast to 1984.
2660,hr7ifp,3,"I second this. Just read it a Month ago and considering the COVID , it brought up a really good thought experiment."
2661,hr7ifp,3,The End of the World Running Club was a funny post-apocalyptic book I’ve enjoyed.
2662,hr7ifp,3,"I read that in like middle school and that shit fucked me up, man. Great stuff"
2663,hr7ifp,3,"Another second. A great exploration of not just what survival looks like, but also how art/culture continues on... plus the whole pandemic thing makes it extra timely."
2664,hr7ifp,3,"Peter Heller- Dog Stars. Highly, highly recommend."
2665,hr7ifp,3,One of the best trilogies I’ve ever read!
2666,hr7mzh,11,"There’s a book called Beauty Queens by Libba Bray, and it’s about 50 beauty pageant contestants shipwrecking on an island, in a sort of Lord of the Flies situation. It’s pretty satirical and kind of looks at how women interact with others and themselves without the pressures of society/their families."
2667,hr7mzh,7,"Very sorry to hear about your father.

If you liked the Sookie Stackhouse books, try the Undead series by Mary Janice Davidson. They’re about a newly made vampire named Betsy who has to contend with adapting to her new undead state while trying to maintain her ties to friends and family. They’re more directly funny and romantic than the Sookie books—just a frothy beach read. There are also about 15 of them, so if you like them, they’ll keep you busy for a while."
2668,hr7mzh,3,This sounds amazing!
2669,hr7mzh,5,Winnie-The-Pooh
2670,hr7mzh,10,"The Discworld series has hilarious adventures (I'm partial to Guards! Guards!, if you're wondering where to start).

P.G. Wodehouse wrote a ton of light-hearted stuff - my favorites of his include Jill the Reckless, Love Among the Chickens, and Carry On, Jeeves."
2671,hr7mzh,6,"Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones - yes, there’s a book!! It’s lovely."
2672,hr7mzh,5,"*The Enchanted April*, by Elizabeth von Arnim. Just charming and lovely.

*Sex, Murder, and a Double Latte*, by Kyra Davis made me laugh out loud several times.

*The Moonspinners*, by Mary Stewart. Or any book by Mary Stewart, really. She wrote romantic suspense and they are great old-fashioned escapist novels."
2673,hr7mzh,3,"Anything by Nalini Singh, Ilona Andrews, Rebecca Zanetti, Thea Harrison, Kresley Cole (but be warned her series kind of stops abruptly due to life things). Totally get the escapism. It’s why I like this genre - bc it’s so far removed from real life. 

Also check out overdrive! Links up with your local public library for ebooks and audiobooks.

ETA: Deborah Harkness if you like history (first book is a Sundance series!), Rachel Grant/Laura Florand/Laura Griffin/Piper J Drake if you’re more into contemporary/competence porn. 

Goodreads helps me keep track of books I’ve read (links with Kindle app) and is also a great way to find new book recs! Try not to read too many reviews though bc it can definitely spoil the books. 

I’m jealous that you’ll be able to read these for the first time (I just went on a massive reread binge during quarantine)."
2674,hr7mzh,3,I have recently found the Tiffany Aching books by Terry Pratchett immensely comforting.
2675,hr9qdm,6,“The Catcher in the Rye”
2676,hr9qdm,3,Silas Marner has a enchanting style.  It is a fairly short novel.

It’s a big motherfucker, but it’s so epic you won’t regret it"
2685,hr9qdm,5,"You'll want to pick up some Flannery O'Connor, some Truman Capote, and some William Faulkner. And some more Hemingway."
2686,hr9qdm,4,The Jungle. The Great Gatsby. The Awakening.
2687,hr9qdm,3,Such a good book
2688,hr9qdm,4,"Oh, and Steinbeck!"
2689,hr9qdm,11,Grapes of Wrath
2690,hr9qdm,3,"Yes, but the Count of Monte Cristo, which you said you read, is over 1000 pages... unless you read the abridged version."
2691,hr9qdm,5,Lord of the flies sounds like it’s down your lane.
2692,hr9qdm,3,Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a good one
2693,hr9qdm,16,East of Eden
2694,hr9qdm,6,"The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho, it’s a bit of a reach though"
2695,hr9qdm,3,Flowers for Algernon

2697,hr9qdm,3,one flew over the cuckoos nest
2698,hr9qdm,3,Lord of the Flies - a must!!
2699,hr9qdm,3,The Color Purple is one of my favorites!
2700,hr9qdm,3,"The writing is brilliant.  If you mostly read for plot, it might not be the right book for you.  There is a plot, but it’s slow to develop."

2703,hratb9,5,"Winds of War, War and Remembrance, Catch 22, Slaughterhouse Five, Bridge over the River Kwai, or from the civilian perspective The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. 

These are very different, but they are all good and all about WWII."
2704,hratb9,3,Going to second “the Winds of War” and “War and Remembrance”. Absolutely fantastic WW2 epic.
2705,hratb9,5,I completely spaced on Slaughterhouse-Five. Good call.
2706,hratb9,10,"The Book Thief by Markus Zusak would be my top recommendation.

Edit: I’d also highly recommend The Nazi Officer’s Wife by Edith Hahn-Beer. It’s a nonfiction account of how a Jewish woman survived the Holocaust."

2708,hratb9,3,Between Shades of Grey is very good historical fiction
2709,hratb9,4,"All the Light We Cannot See - Anthony Doerr

The Girl in the Blue Coat - Monica Hesse

Between Shades of Gray - Ruta Sepetys

The Book Thief - Markus Zusak

These are all off the top of my head, but I remember really liking these."
2710,hratb9,4,"Unbroken - Laura Hillenbrand
Great narrative nonfiction about an Olympians experience in the war and in a POW camp."
2711,hratb9,10,"Band of Brothers is an amazing book, also made a great miniseries."
2712,hratb9,3,Band of Brothers was mentioned but Dick Winters book Beyond Band of Brother is also a good read afterwards. For a completely different perspective on ww2 the book No Better Friend by Robert Weintraub is a good read.
2713,hratb9,3,"The Alice Network. It's fiction, but based on real people and mostly a true account of a female-based spy network across Europe. Also has a good reading list in the back if you want to find out more after reading it."
2714,hraya1,11,Ruth Reichel's books!
2715,hraya1,3,Heartburn is the closest I can think of and it is not that at all. What a cool structure.
2716,hraya1,5,Mastering the area of Soviet Cooking is a really good one. I enjoyed the read and appreciates how food helped weave the author's individual history with her family's legacy and cultural history.
2717,hraya1,3,The Lost Recipe for Happiness by Barbara O’ Neal
2718,hraya1,6,"[Aphrodite](https://www.amazon.com/Aphrodite-Memoir-Senses-Isabel-Allende/dp/0060930179) by Isabel Allende isn't exactly a cookbook, but love of food features prominently.

In one scene, she describes putting Antonio Banderas into a giant tortilla, naked, covering him with guacamole, and gobbling him up. That's sort of a recipe, right?

I'll get this words wrong, but she commented that: ""Some women are happy only while married. I remember the period between my first marriage and my second. It was the worst week of my life.""

It was sweet, and sad, and sensuous—absolutely wonderful."
2719,hraya1,3,“The Kitchen Daughter” by Jael McHenry. Really liked this one. I think it sneaks up on you. 😊
2720,hraya1,3,Not sure if this is comparable but Garden Spells is a cute one that has aspects of recipes for the food she caters and the magic it possesses
2721,hraya1,3,*Natalie Tan’s Book of Luck and Fortune* by Roselle Lim
2722,hraya1,11,"Kitchens of the Great Midwest by J Ryan Stradal isn’t technically recipes, but each chapter is structured around a specific dish and the role the dish plays in the protagonist’s life (she’s a cook). Fantastic read."
2723,hraya1,3,Wasn’t Julia like this? Using Julia Child’s recipes?
2724,hraya1,3,"Thanks for sharing out my little labor of love! &lt;3 I don't have recipes in the book itself, but there is a companion digital cookbook on my website  [https://www.crystalking.com/thefoodofancientrome](https://www.crystalking.com/thefoodofancientrome)   I also have a companion cookbook to my second novel, also about a historical chef (this time in the Renaissance), *The Chef's Secret.*  Buon Appetito!"
2725,hraya1,3,"Five Quarters of the Orange by Joanne Harris. It’s a story told by a daughter who’s going through her late mother’s cookbook and uncovers some dark family stories throughout, I love that book. A mix of cooking and drama."
2726,hrb1ef,5,You may enjoy the Memory Man (Amos Decker) series by David Baldacci.
2727,hrb1ef,11,I’d definitely recommend The Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French
2728,hrb1ef,3,Ross Macdonald is a superb choice! He is my favorite of the classics. Lew Archer is the OG detective.
2729,hrb1ef,6,The Cuckoo’s Calling trilogy by “Robert Galbraith” (J K Rowling) is good
2730,hrb1ef,8,"Sherlock Holmes? I have the entire collection and court was never even mentioned, Imao. It’s mostly short stories, but there are some long ones."
2731,hrb1ef,4,"The Inspector Gamache series (starting with ""Still Life"") by Louise Penny. Best mystery series I've ever read, and she's still writing books."
2732,hrb1ef,3,Karin Slaughter
2733,hrb1ef,3,"If you like books with darker themes, try The Millenium series by Steig Larsen (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc.). The first book starts off with a slightly boring subplot about the magazine the protagonist works for but really picks up after that (it’s over after the first 30 or so pages, of memory serves). Gillian Flynn’s books are also great, especially Dark Places. If you’re looking for something lighter, I don’t think any of Agatha Christie’s Poirot or Ms Marple books feature court scenes. I’d recommend The ABC Murders or Cat Among the Pigeons."
2734,hrb1ef,4,Check out Agatha Christie - I can only think of 2 of her 80 odd books that feature scenes in a court room.
2735,hrb1ef,3,This was my first thought too. I love her books!
2736,hrbjrn,23,I think I read it at your age. I think that’s an okay age for it. I never read past the first book though. It had lots of imagination fuel for me at the time.
2737,hrbjrn,5,"Ok thanks, I’ll take that into consideration."
2738,hrbjrn,4,I think it’s a great book to read at your age.
2739,hrbjrn,5,14? Totally fine for you. It’s not hard read but it may be a little slow at times.
2740,hrbjrn,3,"I read Dune at about your age. It took two or three tries to break through the first couple of chapters, but after that is was pretty smooth sailing (I had read a lot of other science fiction by then so that helped). I think of Dune and Dune Messiah as one book in two volumes. If you don’t read messiah, you get a skewed picture."
2741,hrbjrn,3,The audio book is very good
2742,hrbjrn,19,"14 definitely isn’t too young. My number one tip? Don’t speed read it. Take it all in. There are a lot of complexities to it that make the story what it is. 

And second tip, make sure the copy you pick up has the bit at the back with a breakdown of what different words and phrases mean. I think they all have it, but just double check :)"
2743,hrbjrn,3,"I read the fine series at 14. I enjoyed much of it, especially the first book. Some of the later books I just didn’t have the life experience to understand what they were talking about..."
2744,hrbjrn,3,"Thanks, that's really helpful."
2745,hrdffn,3,"Gotta reconnecting Touching Spirit Bear by Ben Mikaelson and if you’re okay with more kiddie like books, the Island trilogy by Gordon Korman. Even though this set is definitely for kids, it was the first and only island survival book I’ve ever read that really has some neat info on what island surviving realistically looked like. Getting fresh water from salt water, starting fires, avoiding animals, identifying edible plants, it’s great. Don’t knock it just because it’s for kids!

And touching spirit bear is set in rural Alaska. Teen boy gets sent out in the wilderness as a Juvie style punishment instead of actual juvenile detention time and he has to make it (mostly) on his own. People come check on him and it’s not nearly as living only on the land as the Island books, but the setting is very cool."
2746,hrdffn,3,"Maybe try My Absolute Darling by Gabriel Tallent. It’s about a teenage girl being raised by a survivalist, doomsday prepared father in rural Northern California. It’s an easy read and very gripping but deals with some pretty adult themes like incest, rape and child abuse. So not exactly like Hatchet, but the main character is about the same age and a lot of it has a similar surviving in the woods feel."
2747,hrdffn,4,"Into the Wild

My Side of the Mountain 

127 Hours (Between a Rock and a Hard Place)

Lost on a Mountain in Maine"
2748,hrdffn,5,"{{My side of the mountain by Jean Craighead George}} and {{Julie of the wolves}}, also by her. Also {{Island of the blue dolphins}} by Scott O’dell"
2749,hrdffn,7,Into Thin Air and Into the Wild. Same author and he’s a great writer.
2750,hrdffn,3,Have you read the 4 sequels and spinoffs of Hatchet?
2751,hrdffn,3,"Yeah, personally I liked the alternate ending with the winter."
2752,hrdffn,3,My Side of the Mountain
2753,hrdffn,7,"A classic, Lord of the Flies. A group of young boys left to survive, totally unprepared."
2754,hrdffn,3,"I think it becomes comical in that they are so innocent but in an extreme situation, so some things they say to each other and how they make decisions can be ridiculous. It definitely wasn’t written to be funny. It is a reflection of human nature."
2755,hrdffn,3,Farley Mowatt’s “Lost in the Barrens.”
2756,hrdffn,4,"My Side of the Mountain 

The Cay 

Island of the Blue Dolphins"
2757,hrdffn,3,"It’s definitely more ironic than actual comedy. Sometimes the boys can be quippy but those quips can also be really cutting. 

The Most Dangerous Game is a short story about survival. 

My Side of the Mountain is good too but he chooses to remove himself from society and goes and lives in the woods he gets a pet falcon. It’s pretty badass. Also there are sequels...? Can’t remember 100%. 

Touching Spirit Bear. Has survival with stakes."
2758,hrdffn,3,"Into the Wild. You've probably read it, but if you haven't, you simply must. It changed my life even more than Hatchet, which to this day is one of the most inspirational books I've ever read. It's a bit different, because it's a biography, written by a journalist who tracked the protagonist's journey across America, gathering stories from all the people whose lives he touched. The focus is less on survival, and more on the impact this one man had during his short time in the world, although there is a fair amount of details about how he survived on this journey. It's all about the journey of Chris McCandless, a model student from a wealthy family who decided to leave his cookie-cutter life to trek across the country and live life to the fullest. If you liked Hatchet, you'll love Into the Wild."
2759,hreqlq,9,"One of the writers on the show, C.K. Walker, is really popular NoSleep author who has self-published her short stories into 3 volumes called Cold, Thin Air. You can also read a bunch of her stuff on her personal website. She’s a great writer and I think you’ll like her stuff if you’re a fan of The Haunting of Hill House."
2760,hreqlq,14,"Picnic at Hanging Rock by Joan Lindsay

The Shining by Stephen King 

House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski,"
2761,hreqlq,3,I will always upvote any SK recommendation ❤️
2762,hreqlq,10,Just a warning...The book is completely and utterly different than the show :/ I fell in love with the show and was disappointed to find out just how different it was from the book. I still really enjoyed the book. But 2 completely different stories!
2763,hreqlq,5,"Was looking for this comment... I read the book first and was surprised by the show! Similarly, I enjoyed both, but two completely different stories for sure"
2764,hreqlq,3,Agreed! Loved both. But it is weird how completely different they are!
2765,htrnvv,3,"The Foundation series my friend, by the one and only Isaac Asimov. Has a solid meaning throughout the novels."
2766,htrnvv,3,If you liked Ready Player One you probably also like the Bobiverse series by Dennis E. Taylor
2767,htrnvv,3,"Have you read Lies of Locke Lemora? If not, start there! (it's also a series)

Have you read any Lois McMaster Bujold? try her Vokosigan Saga. The reading order is a little confusing. I recommend starting with Shards of Honor and the sequel, Barrayar, which you can get in a combined omnibus book called Cordelia's Honor. 

She also wrote a very good fantasy series, The Curse of Chalion series.

For some sci-fi fun, try Spider Robinson's Callahan series, starts with Callahan's Crosstime Saloon. It's a collection of scifi short stories, some funny, some sad, with a great bunch of characters and lots of puns, all set in a bar on Long Island. They come together into a narrative, and it continues over a series of books.

Finally, The Girl, the Gold Watch, and Everything, by John MacDonald is dated, but it's a funny caper novel with a scifi twist.

Edit: Also, have you read the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett? I think you might really like them. Fantasy, humor, depth. Note that everyone agrees they get much better after the first few books, although those are fun too. Try Guards! Guards! to start."
2768,htrnvv,3,"You may like the author, Jasper Fforde.  Check his “Thursday Next” books."
2769,htrnvv,3,"If you like science fiction meets puzzles, try An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green! It’s modern sci fi and incorporates puzzles, though most are solved off screen."
2770,htrnvv,5,I came here to suggest that. Jasper Fford is brilliant. Funny and clever.
2771,htrnvv,3,"Discworld, Thursday Next and the Vorkosigan books are all great recommendations.   Here’s a few more.  From the younger side of the street I like to read (and I’m an old woman) -

Holy shit. This book. 

I’ve been having some passive ideation lately. Some shitty stuff has been triggering my PTSD, anxiety, and depression. 

But this book is fun, funny, and zen AF. Very heavy Buddhism at play in the core of it. It’s beautiful. 

It’s all the benefits of motivational self-help, for someone who hates motivational self-help."
2785,hts01x,15,The Wheel of Time series is a lot of fun if you’re into Game of Thrones-ish stuff.
2786,hts01x,9,The Storied Life of AJ Fikry
2787,hts01x,6,Yes! The book has more detail than [the original speech](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/) (though watching him and his animated self is lovely).
2788,hts01x,42,“A Walk in the Woods” by Bill Bryson.
2789,hts01x,5,The graphic novel Death Vigil is amazing and offers recently deceased protagonists.   I wish you well. ❤
2790,hts01x,3,"I knew this would be near the top, I was gunna suggest it myself. I think it would be a really good one."
2791,hts01x,58,"Not sure how you feel about comics/graphic novels. _Saga_ is great. It is still being written (by Brian K. Vaughan with art by Fiona Staples), but there are plenty of story arcs already out there that are very engaging. The basic premise is a world with intergalactic war, and the main couple are from opposing sides of the war. If their relationship (and child) are discovered, they will be murdered. There is laughter, love, heartbreak, and horror. The artwork adds to the story and the emotional nuances of different moments. 

A compendium edition was recently published that includes issues #1-54. There are also collected editions with 6 issues per volume."
2792,hts01x,37,"When Breath Becomes Air, a book written by Paul Kalanithi as he was dying.

A secular Buddhist take on dying: The Five Invitations by Frank Ostaseski.

For distracting fun: An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green.

My condolences for what you're going through."
2793,hts01x,40,The Count of monte cristo by Alexander Dumas is my favorite book ever. I also recommend 100 years of solitude by gabriel garcia marquez
2794,hts01x,9,"Outlander series is good. And the Harry Potter books are way better than the movies. They get more adult level as they go along.  Outsiders by SE Hinton. Bernard Cornwall is a good author to check out. The Dresden Files is also a good series.
I hope your journey is a peaceful one."
2795,hts01x,27,IQ84 if you haven't read it already. Good one to get immersed  into a sorta familiar but also totally different world
2796,hts01x,98,"The Travelling Cat Chronicles  by Hiro Arikawa. Subtle,  but... one of few books that made me cry it was so emotionally touching"
2797,hts01x,46,"A Man's Search For Meaning, by Victor Frankl"
2798,hts01x,34,Seconded. Loved it
2799,hts01x,3,"Yes, Its a poem in sanskrit but when translates to english you can read it as novel, as I did. First chapter is really there for no reason but after that it is quite good in terms of story.

Its definitely an emotional story, if you invest in it enough.
There are versions of rama stories that has been retold by many other authors. Like Amish retold the story in trilogy sita, ram and raavan. There are many versions of Ramayana but I prefer the first written.

About me, I just like stories. I have a tendency to find the original(first introduced) things. Which is why I mentioned the Valmiki's version. If you read it and didn't like it then, I will say, you added one more perspective and review to the story.

P.S. I am an atheist, just because I like to read panchtantra doesnt make me believe in talking animals. I enjoy such stories because I love fantasy. 

If someone do such thing to my wife I will definitely do anything to save her. That is why it connects you so much. 

But in the end, you are the one, who reads the story, to judge it if it's good or not. 🙂"

I'm sorry if none of these is for you, but they are all books that I got lost in. If you have any specific preference in literature type, please say the word."
2801,hts01x,3,Rhapsodic by Laura Thalassa is on kindle unlimited and has 2 sequels if you enjoy it ❤️
2802,hts01x,51,"Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones is about creatures supporting each other (I prefer the book to the Ghibli film), and Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Graham is a quiet story about living with the rhythm of nature. Hugs to you."
2803,hts01x,106,One that always hits home for me is The Little Prince. Take care :)
2804,hts01x,5,"Oh YEH! If you want to be distracted and immersed in a fucked up world, specifically try Snuff or Invisible Monsters"
2805,hts01x,8,"In terms of pure compulsive readability Dark Matter by Blake Crouch would be my number one suggestion. A pretty heavy theme in the book too is accepting the life you’ve lived, which I think might suit you well."
2806,hts01x,14,"I second this, Saga is sooo good!"
2807,hts01x,3,The throne of glass series is really good
2808,hts01x,23,I gave this one a shot and frankly couldn't get past the first chapter. Writing style did not work for me at all.
2809,hts01x,141,I'm not here with any suggestion. Your post has me heartbroken. I feel for you fellow redditor.
2810,hts01x,4,The Stormlight Archives
2811,hts01x,4,On Death and Dying by Kübler-Ross.
2812,hts01x,5,"*An Enchantment of Ravens* is completely charming.

Also, Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* is one of the best things ever written. The Charles Martin translation is particularly good."
2813,hts01x,38,American Gods by Neil Gaiman gave me an odd sense of peace when I read it.
2814,hts01x,7,"Not sure how your taste runs but these are books on my shelf that I liked reading.  Hope these bring you some comfort or escapism. 

Lamb by Christopher Moore

Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett

Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams

Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie

Microserfs by Douglas Coupland"
2815,hts01x,7,Ink heart

2817,hts01x,3,"I listened to Reasons to be Cheerful by Nina Stibbe while recovering from bowel surgery. Was light and funny though a bit inane, but that suited my low attention span.
Good on you giving the finger to self help."
2818,hts01x,6,A Man Called Ove (by Fredrik Backman) is a really charming story if you’re into realistic fiction.
2819,hts01x,13,"If Cats were to Disappear From the World by Genki Kawamura 

And

The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa

I'm a big fan of cats lol so sorry about the cat themed recommendations but they arent really focused on cats. Both deal with death if that's something you're looking for.

The Travelling Cat Chronicles is told from a cats perspective but it focuses on the cats owner. I found it to be a really touching book."
2820,hts01x,5,"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michel Chabon. His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman (YA but don’t let that put you off, they’re amazing). If you like historical fiction, the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O’Brian (this could go either way since people tend to either not get it at all or LOOOVE it, but if you’re one of the latter I can promise you an incredible reading experience). For sheer escapism
I also like The Physician by Noah Gordon. Btw I also loved The Fault In Our Stars!"
2821,hts01x,3,"Hello My Name is Henry by Micah Schnabel. My favorite book. It’s about a 20-something cashier stuck in his very small, very poor hometown in the Midwest. It’s devastating in the best way. Take care OP"
2822,hts01x,6,"Honestly, I'd suggest The Secret Seven series, The Famous Five, Harry Potter, Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys.. You can never get tired of them :)"
2823,hts01x,23,"The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho

Life of Pi - Yann Martel

The Little Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 

Can’t even begin to describe how lovely these books are :-)"
2824,hts01x,121,"A good escapism author is Terry Pratchett, witty, clever and hilarious, his discworld books are one of the best I've read"
2825,hts01x,13,I second When Breath Becomes Air. Amazing book.
2826,hts01x,10,Oof 100 years of solitude is a heavy book. Love it.
2827,hts01x,5,"If you’re into funny plays with great wit, Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare is really funny. The movie does a great job at staying close to the play as well if you’d like to watch that too"
2828,hts01x,6,"His Dark Materials trilogy - The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and Amber Spyglass. It's one of my favorite overall stories. 

Also, I did appreciate the Narnia series, although it's meant for younger kids and the language can get a little repetitive, I loved the concept of the first book the Magician's Nephew and then the Prince Caspian story and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader were really cool."
2829,hts01x,6,"It's a bit childish, but I'd love to feel like a kid again in my last days, whenever they come, so I'd suggest The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster!"
2830,hts01x,3,"Try z Terry Pratchett's  Discworld.   On the surface, they are silly.  Underneath, is a wonderful social commentary.  The stories can make you laugh and cry.  Skip the first 2 books.  They are very silly and Pratchett hadn't quite found his voice.  Maybe start with Mort."
2831,hts01x,7,"The Percy Jackson series and most of the subsequent spin-offs and follow up series are just a fun, light-hearted book series that you can enjoy for a while if you've never read them. They're some of my favorite comfort books."
2832,hts01x,17,I can suggest The Secret Garden. I have loved that story and I can say its worth the read. 💙
2833,hts01x,5,"Anything by Brandon Mull. Especially his 5 kingdoms series, and especially the 4th book. 

See if you can get the Libby app - it links to libraries and you can get your books for free that way!"
2834,hts01x,17,Tuesdays With Morrie broke my heart! It’s such a nice read
2835,hts01x,9,"""kind of a slump emotionally"" 

I don't blame you.

I hope you have all the support that you need. Your post will stay with me a long time."
2836,hts01x,17,"How about some humor? David Sedaris is irreverent and hilarious. Anything by him. Also any the wonderful auto- bio books  of Alexandra Fuller.  
Wilding by Isabella Tree really a wonderful uplifting read 
Good luck and gentle hugs on your journey. Hope we meet one day."
2837,hts01x,40,"Looking for something that's immersive and takes you away from reality? There's almost nothing better than the Harry Potter series, starting with *Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone*.

Other books I've basically gotten lost in while reading:

* *The Bean Trees* or *Prodigal Summer* by Barbara Kingsolver (or basically anything she writes)
* *Ahab's Wife* by Sena Jeter Naslund
* *The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society* by Annie Barrows and Mary Ann Shaffer
* *Water for Elephants* by Sara Gruen
* *The Time Traveler's Wife* by Audrey Niffenegger
* *The Mists of Avalon* by Marion Zimmer Bradley
* *Outlander* and the rest of the series by Diana Gabaldon
* *Coraline* by Neil Gaimon
* *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck
* *Practical Magic* by Alice Hoffman
* *All Creatures Great and Small* by James Herriott

If you don't mind an incredibly offbeat sense of humor, consider *Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff*, *Christ’s Childhood Pal,* by Christopher Moore. He also has an accidental vampire series that is totally weird and funny that starts with *Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story*, as well as a bunch of other bizarrely awesome novels.

For non-fiction, *Three Cups of Tea* by Greg Mortensen or *Here If You Need Me: A True Story* by Kate Braestrup.

On a personal note, I wish you had a better prognosis, but most of all, I hope that you continue to ask for what you need as you go through this. I'm sending you the internet equivalent of a hug and my fervent wishes that you find pleasure and peace in the time that you have."
2838,hts01x,5,*Master and the Margarita* Mikhail Bulgakov &amp; *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* Milan Kundera. Always at the top of any of my recommended lists! :) (plus both have interesting historical contexts too!)
2839,hts01x,23,"Came here to say this. Laughter, emotion, fantasy, escape, beauty, heart and the most memorable characters. An unforgettable read. Good luck with your reading OP."
2840,hts01x,12,Saga is absolutely stunning
2841,hts01x,3,I’m so sorry. I hope you are okay. ❤️
2842,hts01x,3,The Gormenghast Trilogy will take you into a fascinating world and there is some incredible writing to enjoy too 😁
2843,hts01x,7,*Furiously Happy* was terrific. Side-splittingly funny and not too philosophical or saintly. Lawson is a bit like your aunt who gets too drunk at parties and shamelessly shouts unspeakable things without a single fuck given.
2844,hts01x,3,What Alice Forgot by Liane Moriarty. She also wrote Big Little Lies. You can’t go wrong with her cause all her books are amazingly written and as equally heartfelt.
2845,hts01x,7,Happy cake day! Hugs
2846,hts01x,3,"The Five People you Meet in Heaven, Mitch Albom. Take care, hug."
2847,hts01x,19,Thirded great book
2848,hts01x,3,"I don’t know if this is too sad/real for you, but considering you said you liked the Fault in Our Stars I thought it might be okay - it’s called Before I Die by Jenny Downham. It’s a beautiful story of a young girl who has a terminal illness. It’s amazing. 

But if that is too close to home or horrible, then I would highly recommend both the Goldfinch or Secret History by Donna Tartt. Pretty weird books, but just incredibly written and you fall very fast into their world. Another one I just finished - quite a short book but also beautiful, called Before the Coffee Gets Cold. Enjoy your reading."
2849,hts01x,3,"Michael Chabon also wrote an amazing (!)crossover alt read called The Yiddish Policemen’s Union. If you’re into music, try his Telegraph Avenue. That segues into David Mitchell’s new release Utopia Avenue. He also wrote Cloud Atlas. I really like the Bone Clocks which I reread while my SO was dying."
2850,hts01x,3,"I’m only mentioning this because you said you loved Fault in our Stars, but Tesdays With Morris is an excellent similar book."
2851,hts01x,3,The hunger games. I just diapered into the world. It’s truly a masterpiece
2852,hts01x,3,"Shogun, James Clavell. Immersive"
2853,hts01x,3,all the best

2855,hts01x,3,"The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard (it’s a nonfiction book about the Scott Antarctic expedition in the early 1900s), And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie, The Amelia Peabody mysteries by Elizabeth Peters, Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett."
2856,hts01x,6,"I know this one is a little different, but the Calvin and Hobbes tenth anniversary edition. The comics can be hilarious, poignant and profound. You can lose yourself in them. Also the writings about the comics by Bill are really insightful."
2857,hts01x,3,"Alsο, mortality by Christofer Hitchens. Love and peace."
2858,hts01x,12,Exactly! And you never forget the little nuggets of wisdom Granny occasionally drops
2859,hts01x,4,Fannie Flagg’s Fried Green Tomatoes is a great read
2860,hts01x,4,"I would recommend these on kindle unlimited and it has audio tracks I really was so immersed in it so you can play it and get lost.

Murmur of the Bees - Sofía Segovia  (It's a Spanish novel that was translated to English. One of the best audio narratives I've listened to)  Link - &gt;  [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42306076-the-murmur-of-bees](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42306076-the-murmur-of-bees) 

The Beekeeper's Promise - Fiona Valpy. This also has a brilliant audio track and it's about finding courage in two different time periods how these two characters are connected although completely different.

You see a slight theme of bees here because yes I do love bees.

I would love to connect and just talk books if you wanted you can dm me and we can connect on Goodreads."
2861,hts01x,8,Have you tried The name of the wind? Man I love that book.
2862,hts01x,5,"They already suggested all the books I could have suggested too. All I'm wishing now is for you to have the rest of your days contented, happy and free of pain if possible. You will live forever in the hearts of everyone who loves you. Count us in."
2863,hts01x,4,"I second Good Omens (just finished it), Hitchhiker's (an old favorite of mine), and anything by Agatha Christie (one of my all-time favorite authors)."
2864,hts01x,4,The Infernal Devices by Cassandra Clare
2865,hts01x,4,Second this
2866,hts01x,4,Thanks!
2867,hts01x,10,"Currently working on this and loving it, hard to put down."
2868,hts01x,6,I don't understand the hype either.
2869,hts01x,5,"Damn there’s a book that I’m positive you’d love, but I don’t think it’s been translated in English. It’s called *Seven Times a Cat* in Italian, and the author is Domenica Luciani."
2870,hts01x,3,I loved One to Watch for a story you can lose yourself in. Also the City of brass trilogy. Anything by Sarah J Maas I lose myself in. Neil Gaiman is also a favorite of mine. Lots of hugs friend.
2871,hts01x,6,"Watership Down. Who knew a book about rabbits could be so immersive. There are sad and scary parts, but a happy ending.

Edit: spelling"
2872,hts01x,9,I didn’t care for it either. And I really expected to love it because Rules of Civility is the book I recommend to everyone.
2873,hts01x,3,"Born a Crime - Trevor Noah (incredibly funny)

Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close - Jonathan Safran 

A Man Called Ove

All the Light we Cannot See

Harry Potter

Life of Pi

The Alchemist"
2874,hts01x,12,"Be warned though OP that this is self help, albeit arguably it’s most transcendent"
2875,hts01x,5,"Second Terry Pratchett. Also The Long Earth series is immersive and full of wonder. I think of it often. Take care, OP."
2876,hts01x,3,Was going to recommend Mitch’s books too
2877,hts01x,4,This is not the time nor the place to peddle superstitions/religious beliefs
2878,hts01x,5,I’d go as far to recommend most if not everything by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He’s one of my favorite authors!
2879,hts01x,3,"Second this! I read it for the first time a long time ago and liked it a lot. I re-read it when my grandpa passed away and it hit different, I like it and appreciate it even more now."
2880,hts01x,8,Fourthed! Some of the best writing I've read in a while.
2881,hts01x,3,I’d also recommend What We Learn From Cats (or Lo Que Aprendemos de los Gatos) by Paloma Diaz Mas tho I’m not sure if this one is in a English either but if you know Spanish I can’t recommend this enough
2882,hts01x,5,This book was life changing. Written by a man who thought he was going to die.
2883,hts01x,7,Thirding or fourthing this. Very very good books.
2884,hts01x,3,Ditto
2885,hts01x,4,"I second Throne of Glass. Also try A Cout of Thorns and Roses from the same author as TOG (SJ Maas). King Killer Chronicles, Inheritance Cycle, Sabriel series, Ink and Bone. Plain Kate. Pirates! by Celia Rees."
2886,hts01x,1559,"Hi. John Green here, the author of The Fault in Our Stars. I'm really grateful you loved the book. Thank you for reading it.

Here are a couple recommendations of books that I find totally immersive and just take me away that you might enjoy:

1. The Adventures of Kavalier and Klay by Michael Chabon. This is a big, engrossing book that is also brilliant (it won the Pulitzer Prize) that will make you laugh and cry.
2. When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. If you're looking to read a reflection on illness and dying, I've heard from people that this book made them feel less alone. It's a beautiful and heartwrenching memoir written by a young doctor toward the end of his life.
3. If you want to just laugh and go on a crazy adventure, I recommend Marie Semple's Where'd Ya Go, Bernadette? It's hilarious and ridiculous but then surprisingly moving at the end.

Thanks again for your kind words about TFiOS."
2887,hts01x,6,"Came here to say this. 💕 Also, pair him up with Neil Gaiman and you get Good Omens, which is one of the warmest books I have read. Take care, sending love and hugs."
2888,hts01x,6,"Ted Dekker's  [circle series ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Series)

James Herriot [All Creatures Great and Small](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32085.All_Creatures_Great_and_Small)"
2889,hts01x,5,This might get lost in the comments by I really hope you see it. The last lecture by randy pausch.
2890,hts01x,39,Where’d You Go Bernadette is one of my favorites ever!! Love that you love it.
2891,hts01x,3,Anything by Sarah Maas. The Thieves series by Lexi Blake is just good escapist fun. No life lessons need be learned.
2892,hts01x,15,There will never not be a time to read the little prince. I literally stocked a few dozen copies to give away in addition to a standard present. I love this book so much
2893,hts01x,3,"I know you said no self help but Alan Watts has a really great outlook on dying you might enjoy in your situation. Try ""the wisdom of insecurity"" ""The Book"" and ""Out of your mind.""

Id recommend the audiobooks personally, his recorded lectures are the best. He's a great speaker and you'd be missing out having his material read to you by someone else.

Most of his lectures have also be posthumously uploaded to youtube, so you can find them without having to pay if you want to just get your feet wet and see if you like it.

My condolences during this tough transition. I hope you find contentment and peace."
2894,hts01x,11,"If you are interested in reading a book by a young man recounting his journey to his own death, “When Breath Becomes Air” is brilliantly written.  I read it during my own cancer treatment and found it very insightful. Much of it has never left me."
2895,hts01x,8,"Second Howl’s Moving Castle — one of the most wholesomely immersive books I’ve read, &amp; loved every second."
2896,hts01x,5,"Okay, hear me out... but maybe Twilight? (I know, I KNOW)

I'm reading it right now and having a ball. I love looking at it with a more mature perspective than I did as a teenager, because I can see that it is both better and worse than I remember. It \*\*definitely\*\* did not deserve the hate it got, but it is hilarious sometimes how silly it can be. But at the same time, you can just shamelessly consume it as entertaining chick lit. It's an easy read, for when your brain isn't feeling up to something complicated. But you can also stop and try to put into words why something was a good or bad writing choice, which adds an extra layer of entertainment."
2897,hts01x,4,"Or similarly *The Bright Hour* by Nina Riggs, it was compelling and beautiful and heartbreaking."
2898,hts01x,3,I hated this book. I was fascinated by the concept and absolutely despised the execution of that concept. But I know tons of other people love it.
2899,hts01x,6,"I haven't read it yet but I've sold soooo many, for birthdays, baptisms, confirmations... I even had a customer once, from Spain, when I worked in Aarhus who wanted to buy it on Danish. That was her souvenir when she travelled: Le Petit Prince in the local language. I really liked that!"
2900,hts01x,3,"Second The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating! As someone who has a (mush less severe but still sometimes debilitating) chronic illness, who also loves all wildlife, it was such a comforting read. 

Also seconding The Color Purple. Incredible and devastating and hopeful all at once."
2901,hts01x,3,"The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley.

If you are open minded about drug use, this is the book for you. Huxley chronicles his friend’s experience using mescaline to understand/accept/interpret his final days, which prompted his own experimentation. 

These substances have been demonized by federal governments, but their healing powers can’t be ignored. 

Sending you love and light."
2902,hts01x,4,"I'm reading The Three Musketeers (Dumas), and I really like it. Another one I would recommend is a short story called The Death of Ivan Ilyich (Tolstoy), which is very moving. Then there's Family Happiness (Tolstoy), which is just as moving, although in a very different way. Also, Goodnight Mister Tom is very good. Those are all of the ones I can think of right now."
2903,hts01x,3,"Fried Green Tomatoes at the whistle stop cafe, when marnie was there, the mothman prophecies, howls moving castle"
2904,hts01x,211,"I knew you were a decent writer John Green; now I know you’re a good man. 

I’ll highjack this to suggest reading poetry as a potential avenue for our OP. 

I love ‘Winter Stars’ by Larry Levis, and it’s available on Amazon. Poetry can hit you so hard and can be enjoyed quickly and linger in your mind and dreams so efficiently. 

Cheers. To the Festival."
2905,hts01x,4,"I haven't, but I'll add it to my reading list. Thanks for the recommendation!"
2906,hts01x,4,"You’ve got a lot of suggestions for books that I have enjoyed OP. My recommendation would be Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr Fox. It’s a children’s book, and it’s a simple read you’ll be able to finish in a few short hours, but I Hope that it may help you feel like a child once again.

I would also like to suggest The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and six more, also by Roald Dahl. They’re a fantastic selection of short stories written by him, more towards adult readers. Frankly, they aren’t greatly philosophical or thought provoking, but just great stories.

That’s all. Thank you for your strength. Happy reading..."
2907,hts01x,3,"It’s a little dark sometimes, but To Kill A Mockingbird is a great book. The themes of living your life with honor have always stuck with me. Another great book allready mentioned here, but I thought I’d mention it too, because the story is so powerful, is Fight Club by Chuck Palhaniuk. A totally original and creative story on finding meaning for the first time in someone’s life. Both movie adaptations of these books are also fantastic. I’m so sorry that you have to know you’re time is so limited, but I’m glad you seem to be making the most of it. Keep on doing that. 

Sending you my  Love."
2908,hts01x,38,"John Green!! I loved reading your books throughout the years, and would also like to say that When Breath Becomes Air is one of my personal favorites. It is a raw, selfless autobiography, and also made me think deeply about the relationships in my life. I highly recommend reading."
2909,hts01x,12,"I've been reading your books as an adult, and I like them. Also love you and your brother's youtube channels. Thanks for being a true mensch, you seem like a cool dude. 

Funnily enough, I didn't know about you or your channels until I was in college as an older student. Lazy history professors love to show your work lol."
2910,hts01x,3,"I second Kavalier and Clay, I read it because John talks about it in some of his videos hahah. It’s a wonderful story and world to lose yourself in. 
All the best."
2911,hts01x,26,"It’s coincidental you commented here because I have been watching Crash Course European History in the evenings as something immersive to take my mind off things (I’m a 911 dispatcher and reality tends to be a regular and vaguely inescapable pendulum of bricks to the face, especially in a pandemic). Thank you for your kindness and for putting good things in the world that help us navigate it."
2912,hts01x,7,I highly recommend the Alchemist as well.
2913,hts01x,3,The Sandman graphic novels by Neil Gaiman are delightful and one of those reads that I find myself thinking about long after I've read them. They feel so different and have this juxtaposition of horror and beauty that just pulls me in
2914,hts01x,12,"TFiOS got me into reading when it first came out. Honestly. Your books aren't just good, they're life changing. 

OP, have you tried any of John Green's other books? I have a pretty good feeling you'll be happy with his others as well. They're great for a few reasons but I love that you don't feel like you need to be a teenager to enjoy these books that happen to feature teenagers. I know you'll find them in YA, but trust me on this one. Try Looking for Alaska next, and then enjoy the show that came out recently based on the book. This book made me feel LOTS OF THINGS. ❤️"
2915,hts01x,180,"Thank you so much, Mr. Green. Your book was the first I read after getting my prognosis and also helped me realize, despite being terminal, I'm worthy of love. I credit it for that realization and because of that book am in a happy and healthy relationship in spite of my health."
2916,hts01x,7,"JOHN MOTHER EFFIN GREEN!!! Just wanted to say that I loved TFiOS, Paper Towns, and Looking for Alaska. I’m looking forward to reading more of your work. :) Super cool to see you on here."
2917,hts01x,5,When Breath Becomes Air is my favorite book! Highly recommend it!
2918,hts01x,8,"I just want to say that I hope you’re doing well, and it’s really awesome to see that John Green saw AND responded to your post!"

&gt;A magnificent epic set against a history of seven thousand years of the struggles of Gods and Kings and men - of strange lands and events - of fate and a prophecy that must be fulfilled! THE BELGARIAD
&gt;
&gt;Long ago, so the Storyteller claimed, the evil God Torak sought dominion and drove men and Gods to war. But Belgarath the Sorcerer led men to reclaim the Orb that protected men of the West. So long as it lay at Riva, the prophecy went, men would be safe.
&gt;
&gt;But that was only a story, and Garion did not believe in magic dooms, even though the dark man without a shadow had haunted him for years. Brought up on a quiet farm by his Aunt Pol, how could he know that the Apostate planned to wake dread Torak, or that he would be led on a quest of unparalleled magic and danger by those he loved - but did not know? For a while his dreams of innocence were safe, untroubled by knowledge of his strange heritage. For a little while... THUS BEGINS BOOK ONE OF THE BELGARIAD'

2926,hu3qv5,3,Crime? Any recommendations on organised crime/mafia in particular would be appreciated -fyi I’ve enjoyed The Godfather a lot (:
2927,hu3qv5,3,"for a single mystery/crime maybe 'confessions - the private school murders.' 

for a more fun/childish organized crime book and also one of my favourites in general ever - 'The Whiz Mob and the Grenadine kid.'

 and for just a straight up organized crime book, hmm maybe 'the outsiders' ?

I'm sorry these seem more geared towards kids a little - I'm still a teenager but trying to get into more adult novels. Let me know if you want any more suggestions!"
2928,hu3qv5,3,"Classic is a wide genre.

Kids classic - 'Harry potter' Or ASOUE. (A series of unfortunate events.) by JK Rowling and Lemony Snicket, respectively. both incredible. 

Old classic - 'Wuthering heights' by Emily Brönte is pretty good if you can figure it out. 

Horror classic - 'Pet semetary' is one book I never ever could finish. It's *really* good.

Sci Fi classic - 'Starclimber' by Kenneth Opal. it's heartwarming and fast paced. 

Let me know if you're looking for something more specific!"
2929,hu3qv5,3,Fantasy (preferably one that's lesser known) :)
2930,hu3qv5,4,"I dont read too much non fiction - I do like biographies.

'When breath becomes air' was wonderful. 

Aswell as the 'Dear Canada' series. those might be more historical fiction (not entirely sure) but theyre really really good regardless.

EDIT: 'The gilded razor' is a wonderful biography aswell. 

Im very sorry I couldn't be  more help."
2931,hu3qv5,3,How about a Murder Mystery crossed with Romance/Erotica?
2932,hu3qv5,3,"Mm I don't read much erotica - but I can give you some. 

'Daughters of Darkness' series by Chrissy Peebles.

Or 'Kidnapped.' By Suzanne Ferrell.

Maybe 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami? 

Less mystery and more Erotica Suspense, but I'm trying my best! I'll update if there's anymore I can think of."
2933,hu3qv5,4,"Is it possible to ask for a sub genre? If so, urban fantasy please :)"
2934,hu3qv5,4,"Not dystopia really, the wider realm of magic blending into the modern/real world

Thank you for your suggestions and for doing this!"
2935,hu3qv5,4,"Ooh! deal.

The girl next door - by Jack Ketchum. I struggled to finish it. it's incredibly well written.

and maybe 'The girl with all the gifts'? it's pretty neat."
2936,hu3qv5,3,The “Rivers of London” series by Ben Aaronovitch is brilliant urban fantasy. So good!
2937,hu3qv5,3,Fun thread OP thanks for doing this.
2938,hu3qv5,3,Running with scissors - August Burroughs!
2939,hu4mjb,6,A Star Called Henry by Roddy Doyle. Brutal and beautiful.

2945,hu4mjb,6,I second this. McKinty is great.
2946,hu4mjb,7,Bog Child by Siobhan Dowd
2947,hu4mjb,4,"• ‘Cal’ by Bernard MacLaverty

• ‘The Twelfth Day of July’ by Joan Lingard (YA, a staple read among teenagers from NI during secondary school, also has sequels)

• ‘The Ghost Factory’ by Jenny McCartney

• ‘Reading in the Dark’ by Seamus Deane

• ‘The Fire Starters’ by Jan Carson (not set during the Troubles but examines the long-term effects of the political turmoil/violence on parents, the younger generations, and is quite adept at describing the particular petty divisions that still exist in NI today)

Also seconding ‘Milkman’ by Anna Burns, try her book ‘No Bones’ too. Also recommending the Detective Sean Duffy series by Adrian McKinty which has already been mentioned here."
2948,hu4mjb,3,"The Freedom of the City by Brian Friel. 

It’s a play, not a novel. It’s awesome, and I wrote my master’s thesis on it!"
2949,hu4mjb,3,Big second. I read this whole series end-to-end last week. It’s great.
2950,hu4mjb,5,"I know this isn’t “suggest me a show” but I couldn’t help mentioning Derry Girls, unless this is what made you ask for these recs."
2951,hu4mjb,3,"If you also like fiction set in the historical build-up to The Troubles, I recommend Leon Uris’ Irish novels: Trinity and Redemption"
2952,hu4mjb,7,"I know you asked for fiction, but I so highly recommend Say Nothing by Patrick Keefe. It's non-fiction, but storytelling and not just facts and analysis. And it is just SO GOOD."
2953,hu4mjb,3,"I was coming here to see if anyone mentioned Friel, too!"
2954,hu4mjb,3,"Seconding Cal, I read that for a Northern Irish Lit &amp; The Troubles course at uni 👍🏻"
2955,hu8aoi,361,"A lot of ghibli movies are based on books, reading the source material may be fun! Howl's moving castle is from a book for example :)"
2956,hu8aoi,123,"I lovee that book, it's my go to when I feel sad because it's almost like a fairytale"
2957,hu8aoi,86,"Not sure if this fits, but 'Good Omens' by Pratchett and Gaiman made me feel exactly as you describe (calm, happy, nostalgic).   
Dandelion Wine, maybe? If you haven't read this one yet."
2958,hu8aoi,8,"Thanks, I'll check them out"
2959,hu8aoi,23,Do you know what books other ghibli movies where based on? You've made me curious :)
2960,hu8aoi,209,"for some reason i have always associated some of Neil Gaiman's books to ghibli movies, its probably because while reading i can easily picture the characters and the setting in the unique art style of studio ghibli.

i suggest **the grave yard** **book,** and although it's not exactly happy, but i think it captures some of the mysterious and adventurous themes that are in some of the ghibli movies, and the variety of interesting charterers help a lot with that!"
2961,hu8aoi,58,The girl who drank the moon
2962,hu8aoi,54,The Secret World of Arietty is based on the Borrowers books.
2963,hu8aoi,53,"I can second the Grave Yard Book, very cute story.

If they may be a bit more serious, I would suggest Spinning Silver and Uprooted. Both are by Naomi Novik, but not connected. They have the same kind of fairytale feel that Ghibli movies have."
2964,hu8aoi,10,"Following for answers &lt;3 I have been injured and can't do my normal hobbies, so I'd like to get back into reading instead of just watching YouTube."
2965,hu8aoi,54,"OK.  I have two suggestions for you, plus a bonus pick:

[The Night Circus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus), by Erin Morgenstern;  and  
[Winter’s Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12967.Winter_s_Tale), by Mark Helprin.

Studio Ghibli has some dark stories too, like Princess Mononoke.  With that in mind you might also like [The House of the Spirits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9328.The_House_of_the_Spirits), by Isabel Allende."
2966,hu8aoi,22,The Amazon series Ronia the Robber’s Daughter was based on the book of the same name by Astrid Lindgren. It is in my top 10 books I read aloud to my kids.
2967,hu8aoi,25,I keep hearing House in the Cerulean Sea. Also try the Cathryne Valente series... the fairyland books.
2968,hu8aoi,9,"Sarah Addison Allen books feel like that for me, especially with the slight magical elements. I would try ""Lost Lake"" for that feeling most I think?"
2969,hu8aoi,9,It's been a long time since I've read these but when I was younger I loved the Enchanted Forest Chronicles (starting with Dealing with Dragons) by Patricia C. Wrede. Nostalgic  fairy tale feels for sure. Now that I've remembered the series I gotta reread myself!
2970,hu8aoi,8,Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a great book!
2971,hu8aoi,6,"These books are definitely targeted towards kids, but  the Penderwicks series by Jeanne Birdsall never fails to make me happy, nostalgic, and peaceful."
2972,hu8aoi,8,"Anything by Charles De Lint. It's not going to have the exact same feel as Studio Ghibli, but I think it's close enough. Definitely a western perspective, though"
2973,hu8aoi,70,"Tales from Earthsea is based on the Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin. I remember being so, so excited when I heard Ghibli were making a film based on the books, but it was such a disappointment unfortunately. 

The film in it's own right had some beautiful cinematography and so on, but it's such an amazing series of books that  the film simply pales in comparison. If you haven't read them, I totally recommend them. Kind of dark fantasy with very believable world building, and very interesting magical systems. The endings are also very satisfying on the whole."
2974,hu8aoi,12,I second this! Whimsical and characters that you want to be best friends with.
2975,hu8aoi,11,"I loved it so much, and it totally gives me Studio Ghibli vibes. I also love studio ghibli"
2976,hu8aoi,27,"Second The Enchanted Forest Chronicles and De Lint. Would add Robin McKinley to the list: Spindle’s End, The Blue Sword, The Hero and the Crown.

Also, there is a sequel to Howl’s Movie Castle. Diana Wynne Jones wrote many other books. I would also suggest the Chrestomanci Quartet.

Others:
-Chronicles of Pyrdain by Lloyd Alexander
-Claidi Quartet by Tanith Lee
-Immortals Quartet by Tamora Pierce"
2977,hu8aoi,3,"Patricia Mckillip.  Try Od Magic or the Alphabet of Thorn.

Spindle's End by Robin McKinley"
2978,hu8aoi,3,"I agree with others recommending the Graveyard book, and Jonathan Stange and Mr Norrel.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd add two. 'Illusions"" by Richard Bach. Its about a biplane flyer in rural america who flies planes for joyriders. One day he lands in a field next to another flier and meets mr Shimoda, a wise man who might just be the messiah.

&amp;#x200B;

Another beautiful and precious book is called 'Einsteins dreams'. It's written by a physicist and has been translated into thirty languages. Einstein falls asleep and dream about worlds where time is different. Each world is a small story, a world where time runs backwards, a world where time is ending, a world where time has stopped etc. The writer is a physicist so each of the worlds is 'correct' according to what we understand about physics and the nature of time. However the book is more poetic than scientific. Its a wild, beautiful, haunting book, which will leave you thinking about one of the phenomenon we all face and sometimes take for granted, the passing of time. To quote Yeats 'The innocent and the beautiful have no enemy... but time'."
2979,hu8aoi,8,"Howls moving castle. It’s originally a book, it’s a series of 3 books and it’s awesome."
2980,hu8aoi,19,"Considering there's a Ghibli film of it, read Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series. They have a wonderful sense of place, mystery, and magic."
2981,hu8aoi,130,"Fun fact, Neil Gaiman wrote the script for the English dub of Princess Mononoke!"
2982,hu8aoi,50,"I second Neil Gaiman, and I'd recommend Stardust! It has all the whimsical fantasy adventuring you could want, as well as a very sweet cast of characters."
2983,hu8aoi,6,T.J. Klune's The House in the Cerulean Sea is my go to at the moment for those kinda feelings! Kinda urban fantasy about an orphanage with lots of great characters!
2984,hu8aoi,4,"I recommend the Unicorn series by Tanith Lee, and the worksof Peter S. Beagle. Tamsin is a fave of mine. Also his short stories. :)"
2985,hu8aoi,46,Kiki’s Delivery Service is also based on a book and the newest updated English translation came out this month!
2986,hu8aoi,7,"Kiki’s Delivery Service has a new English translation that came out this year, if you want to read the original book the movie was inspired by."
2987,hu8aoi,22,Yes neil gaiman is my favorite!!! I give his books as gifts when I dont know what to give people lol. My first book was The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
2988,hu8aoi,15,"Second The Night Circus, excellent pick"
2989,hu8aoi,5,"Un Lun Dun by China Mieville 

Here's a part of the plot summary from Wiki, the umbrellas in particular reminded me of the little first bunnies from Spirited Away.

""The book begins with two twelve-year-old girls, Zanna and Deeba, who have begun to notice several strange things happening around them, all of them centring on Zanna.

After she and her friends are attacked by a dark cloud, Zanna spends the next two nights at Deeba's house. Deeba is awoken in the middle of the night by spies moving a broken umbrella. The girls follow it into the basement of a building, where they are drawn through a gap between the worlds of London and Un Lun Dun (or UnLondon).

UnLondon is a nonsensical mirror version of London, inhabited by various creatures and animated items that have been discarded by the inhabitants on London."""
2990,hu8aoi,3,I was about to suggest McKillip’s Forgotten Beasts of Eld as well.
2991,hu8aoi,5,"Definitely, Un Lun Dun by China Mieville has a similar feel to some of Gaiman's stuff, childish adult fantasy.

I've already recommended it to Op but if you haven't read it already you may like it"
2992,hu8aoi,9,"I strongly agree with anyone that mentioned Neil Gaiman &amp; ESPECIALLY The Girl Who Drank the Moon on Audible, which is a beautiful &amp; phenomenal experience. Trust me."
2993,hu8aoi,5,"Not a book but if anyone wants a fairly quick, free webtoon with Ghibli vibes to read I highly recommend House of Stars [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/house-of-stars/list?title\_no=1620&amp;page=1](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/house-of-stars/list?title_no=1620&amp;page=1)"
2994,hu8aoi,6,The Hobbit for sure
2995,hu8aoi,48,You should visit Bruges.
2996,hu8aoi,8,"I second that and most of his other work, Stardust which was also a movie I had that undefinable magic about it. Neverwhere was killer too. Neil Gaiman is a bit different but still has that magic and charm about his stories. I’m I love that he wrote the English translation of one  of Ghibli’s films!!!"
2997,hu8aoi,59,"Surprised I haven't seen this yet, but Haruki Murakami has lots of stuff exactly like this.  My favorites are A Wild Sheep Chase, Hard Boiled Wonderland at the End of the World, Kafka on the Shore, and Dance Dance Dance.

100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is another favorite of mine."
2998,hu8aoi,4,Third
2999,hu8aoi,11,"I second Robin McKinley, Patricia Wrede, and Diana Wynne Jones.

 I also think of Sherwood Smith in a similar vein, especially A Posse of Princesses. Wildwood Dancing by Juliet Marillier, Entwined by Heather Dixon, Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow by Jessica Day George, The Unicorn Chronicles by Bruce Coville, and on the more adult side, the Elemental Masters series by Mercedes Lackey."
3000,hu8aoi,9,All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot. It's technically non-fiction in that it's the memoirs of a country vet from the 50s but the books are so calming and sweet. I love reading about all the farm animals are quirky country characters. It's very wholesome and warm :)
3001,hu8aoi,14,"Lol all these people recommending Gaiman and not one has mentioned Stardust, which is the most Studio Ghibli of all his books in my opinion. Cue magical lands, a quest, and lots of fantastical creatures"
3002,hu8aoi,3,"Seconded. I haven’t see the Earthsea movie, but reading the first three books definitely gave me the same kind of feeling as any Ghibli movie I’ve seen."
3003,hu8aoi,3,I agree Studio Ghibli films are books but if you still want to get that kind of feeling read Murakami's Kafka on the Shore. Or other books of his. You will get what I'm saying :)
3004,hu8aoi,6,Exactly my point that Murakami has lots of similar settings.
3005,hu8aoi,4,The Night Tiger was sort of dreamy ethereal for me
3006,hu8aoi,3,"Interesting,  I'll check this out"
3007,hu8aoi,11,Neverwhere or Statdust has more of a fairytale vibe to it if you wanna look into Gaiman.
3008,hu8aoi,6,"Ahhh Dandelion Wine, classy, you just inspired me to go back to it.. I’ve missed me some Bradbury."
3009,hu8aoi,11,What book? I love that movie
3010,hu8aoi,9,"I feel like I’m always saying this, but Sabriel by Garth Nix is the PERFECT book for a Ghibli feel. It‘s about a young woman who has to run away from her relatively normal boarding school to rescue her father in the far reaches of a nearby magical kingdom. It even has a talking cat and a whimsical flying machine, as well as a really deep and profound theme that makes the adventure seem like far more than just fun shenanigans. Highly recommended!!"
3011,hu8aoi,5,"I would recommend Dyanne Wynne Jones (as others have) specifically Chresromanci Castle books. Also, Skinny Legs and All by Tom Robbins, A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle, Stargirl Jerry Spinelli, books by Kate DiCamillo and specifically The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane."
3012,hu8aoi,3,"A very sweet, short book that I absolutely love is called The Islander by Cynthia Rylant. It’s one of my top 5 and never fails to make me feel like a Ghibli movie makes me feel. Realism with a touch of magic."
3013,hu8aoi,10,"glad you mentioned murakami, he’d be the most obvious parallel.... especially wild sheep chase!"
3014,hu8aoi,6,"Agree entirely with the Neil Gaiman comments - and for me, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the most Ghibli story I’ve ever read - and I’ve read most of the above. The entire time I was reading it, I just pictured Miyazaki characters. It’s deep and rich and sad and powerful and beautiful."
3015,hu8aoi,4,"Growing up, I always explained my fascination with certain Ghibli and animes as the, 'slice of life' feeling. Now that I am an adult, I realize that the appeal of the slow-placed, not-super-dramatic stories is that they exist ... in the moment / in the power of now / at the slow speed of life."
3016,hu8aoi,9,The original swedish film adaption is AMAZING!
3017,hu8aoi,5,Fourth!! It's honestly so goood
3018,hu8aoi,3,"I feel like books that are more “slice of life” also fit this kind of vibe! Some suggestions: Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto, Strange Weather in Tokyo by Hiromi Kawakami, and The Summer Book by Tove Janssen- all of them have well-done English translations and capture a similarly sweet sense of realism."
3019,hu8aoi,3,Invisible Cities
3020,hu8aoi,5,The night circus evokes a lot of the same magical feelings that I get from Ghibli movies
3021,hu8aoi,3,[A Duet for Swans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23363495-the-home-between-homes) by Ander Louis.
3022,hu8aoi,3,"Came here looking for Italo Calvino. In addition to Invisible Cities, I would also recommend The Baron in The Trees, which is certainly peaceful, calming and nostalgic. Certainly not as fantastical as most Ghibli films, but a great read nonetheless."
3023,hu8aoi,5,Ocean at the End of the Lane gave me ghibli vibes. And night circus
3024,hu8aoi,3,I immediately thought of Stardust
3025,hu8aoi,3,"I really enjoyed Spirits in the Wires. His books focus a lot on faeries (there's a collaboration with Brian Froud in there), but more than that, they focus on the  liminal spaces between our world and a different, spirit world of some sort (can change depending on the book) and the interaction of our world with that other world, and how they affect each other."
3026,hu8aoi,11,I LOVE Stardust. It's definitely a fave of mine.  I second that rec.
3027,hu8aoi,15,Title is same as the movie. It’s called Kiki’s Delivery Service by Eiko Kadono.
3028,hu8aoi,8,"That is the way that I felt after reading “Ella Enchanted.” It is a young adult novel, but it was really sweet, really uplifting, and very thought-provoking. I may actually try and re-read it in the near future, actually."
3029,hu8aoi,10,Came here to say Gaiman - Neverwhere and Ocean at the end of the Lane. Or Murakami - Hard Boiled Wonderland and the edge of the world / Wind up bird chronicles.
3030,hu8aoi,11,It is like a fairy tale.
3031,hu8aoi,11,"I love those two Naomi Novik books. The audio versions are amazing. I love European dark fantasy/fairytale books on audio because the accents make it more immersive. Right now I’m listening to the second book of The Bear and the Nightingale trilogy. The Shadow and Bone trilogy as well as The Blood Rose Rebellion trilogy were also great in that format. A recen book I also recommend but is set in the US is The Ten Thousand Doors of January. The performance is good and the book kind of has a similar feeling in a ways I enjoyed it a lot. I’m starting Caraval soon and feel it may have a similar whimsical setting and The Starless Sea soon as well. A couple more possible ones I could think of are To Kill a Kingdom, Enchantée and An Enchantmet of Ravens."
3032,hu8aoi,7,"Dandelion wine feels like a warm summer evening on a big porch in the south when you were a kid. A kind of meandering, cute, heartwarming story. I loved it, but my wife thought it was too all over the place."
3033,hu8aoi,3,"I would suggest Farmer Boy by Laura Ingalls Wilder! I loved to read it and reread it as a kid because the scenes describing farm life, like milking the cows or baking bread or shearing the sheep were so comforting to me."
3034,hu8aoi,3,I don’t know if they are still in print but “once upon a time in Japan” compiled by Sayumi Kawauchi is a series of short Japanese fairy tails (with pictures) that very much remind me of studio gibli movies.
3035,hu8aoi,9,"I was about to suggest The House in the Cerulean Sea. It has been my favorite book of this year so far, and quite properly captures that same Ghibli essence."
3036,hu8aoi,3,The phantom tollbooth
3037,hu8aoi,16,Murakami makes me feel strangely unsettled after reading one of his books! Maybe it’s just me.
3038,hu8aoi,62,"“Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was r******* Bruges might impress me, but I didn't so it doesn't.”"
3039,hu8aoi,4,The Night Circus definitely gave me the same feelings I get from Ghibli movies. It’s been months since I read it and I still can’t stop thinking about it.
3040,hu8aoi,5,"I would strongly suggest {Every Heart a Doorway by Seanan McGuire}

The whole series has that feeling."

3042,hu8aoi,3,"I second Kitchen! It’s such a comfort story for me, I keep going back."
3043,hu8aoi,3,"If you don't mean the books Ghibli is based on, The City of Dreaming Books by Walter Moers maybe?"
3044,hu8aoi,7,"I just finished The Starless Sea yesterday, and I really enjoyed it.  There was definitely whimsical fantasy, but also a compelling plot and a lovely ending."
3045,hu8aoi,3,The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa
3046,hu8aoi,6,"Or Erin Morgenstern's The Starless Sea, as well."
3047,hu8aoi,3,The first three are my favorites as well!
3048,hu8aoi,22,"Yeah, I wouldn't say Murakami is like Ghibli in the least, one of his favorite things to throw around to give weight to anything is some form of rape, sexual violence or bodily violation. Past sexual trauma is a defining characteristic of his female characters more often than not. I guess his worlds have similarities in that there's always more under the surface, but it's usually not warm and fuzzy. It's just slightly different, weirder, and there are almost always outright harmful elements in those worlds. Not exactly comforting."
3049,hu8aoi,34,No freaking way
3050,hu8aoi,5,Try the Phantom Tollbooth
3051,hu8aoi,11,"That is true!

Though it’s not one of their more popular movies, I’d recommend the book *When Marnie Was There*. It’s a little bittersweet, but has a happy ending."
3052,hu8aoi,3,"Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Salman Rushdie.

And some of the imagery in The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho created very similar feelings to those I have while watching certain Ghibli sequences (like when the fairgrounds first transform into the Spirit Spa in Spirited Away, or the first time the forest spirit transforms in Princess Mononoke)"
3053,hu8aoi,9,"Yes, The Ocean at the End of the Lane was my first, too. I then proceeded to devour everything else he wrote. Loved Neverwhere the most."
3054,hu8aoi,4,If you liked Ella Enchanted you should read The Fairy Godmother by Mercedes Lackey. It has that similar concept of retelling fairy tales and people having to navigate being “trapped” by the traditional stories. She basically makes a magic system out of the manipulation of fairy tale tropes. It’s super clever and fun and is kind of like the adult next step from Ella enchanted.
3055,hu8aoi,3,Love this one as well. Characters are phenomenal and the urban fantasy take feels like a fresh form but brings about very essence and invokes the vibrational serenity and emotional state the poster was requesting. I think I’m some way each of us are yearning for this in one way or another. Thank you all for such wonderful recommendations. I myself am excited to begin the journey and to involve my 8 year old as much as I can in the age appropriate literature. 🙏😊
3056,hu8aoi,9,"OP asked for something that made them feel happy, calm, and fulfilled; is Murakami really exactly like that?"
3057,hu8aoi,3,"Little Big by, John Crowley. Just picture the goings on with that Ghibli color and dynamism in mind. The story is straight out of a place of wonder and imagination. Watch a little bit of a ghibli before reading, so as to calibrate your brain for the style of design that you desire. Your imagination will need to do some of the lifting, in whatever case, i believe."
3058,hu8aoi,4,Jonathan Spyri's Heidi
3059,hu8aoi,5,"First time I’ve seen the Claidi quartet mentioned! Second these books. They are the closest thing to a Ghibli movie I’ve ever read.

Dreamy landscapes, strange yet poignant politics, main lead is a girl full of heart who goes where the journey takes her."
3060,hu8aoi,3,I don't know how many of them have been translated into English but any book by Astrid Lindgren gives me exactly this feeling and reminds me of Ghibli movies. Pippi and Emil books are probably her most known but they are actually my least favorite. I re-read Ronia the robber's daughter and Saltkråkan every year
3061,hu8aoi,3,I wouldn’t say murakami would makes you feel warm and happy but he’s definitely got that whimsical feeling. I would highly recommend Kafka on the shore
3062,hu8aoi,3,"Nausicaa is actually based on a Manga written and drawn by Miyazaki himself, i was lucky enough to read it multiple time before discovering the movie, and it was so good that i actually felt the movie was lackluster, the movie was written to be self sufficient so they omitted many many things, amazing things, from the book, and it’s still an amazing movie, but the manga is so much better, if only for all the details and world building
I know it’s not a book but it would really be a huge mistake not to read it anyway"
3063,hu8aoi,5,"I was about to ask about this, because it's been impossible to find the english translation for a long time. I'm so excited to be finding out it's getting re-released!"
3064,hu8aoi,3,I would recommend a book called If Cats Disappeared from the World by Genki Kawamura. I read this book a few months ago and couldn’t quite put my finger on what it made me feel afterwards but I think a Ghibli movie is a great comparison. It’s a super quick read and it’s lighthearted yet sentimental and heartwarming yet heartbreaking
3065,hu8aoi,3,Ghibli makes me feel like those old timey Disney movies and their source material is usually stuff like Brothers Grimm so that collection would probably be my go to suggestion
3066,hu8aoi,5,There's a book??
3067,hu8aoi,6,I actually think the movie stardust is better than the book stardust.
3068,hu8aoi,3,"I wouldn’t bother with Caraval personally. The books you’ve listed that I recognize have fleshed out fantastical worlds that make you long for an adventure, and Caraval tries and fails so hard to achieve the same effect. The worldbuilding is nonexistent apart from it literally telling you that it’s supposed to be amazing and mystical. Especially going from The Bear and the Nightingale, which completely transports you to that world that’s both grounded in reality and full of whimsical folktale magic."
3069,hu8aoi,5,NeverWhere is my favourite as well. Don’t see that opinion very often!
3070,hu8aoi,4,"**So these are books Ghibli did not capture for me. The books are on a totally level from the movie.**

 Loved Ghibli **BUT** Ghibli did not capture the beauty of these books fully.

I read the Ghibli synopsis and dare not watch fully the anime lol. It felt off.




**I. When Marnie was There**

I read when young. I kept thinking to myself, 'this is so Ghibli style'. And lol boy did Ghibli finally made it. I was so Happy!

I knew as a child that crap this is the only book I felt in my whole life this screams for Ghibli. 

Well when the Ghibli anime came out. They totally changed parts of what I loved. 

It did not encapsulate what the book truly is.

I really hope people will read the book. Please give this a try 100%! Harper Collins published it last time. Children's classic; 

**II. The Borrowers; and**

 **III.  Howl's Moving Castle**

The movie is alright. The book however is a totally different absorbing level. 

Dianne Wynne Jones is a legend. Rip. Loved all her books.





**Overall :-**  My personal fav books from above are When Marnie was There, followed by Howl's Moving Castle. 

Sorry if my essay is messy. I'm on mobile. Hard to space ish."
3071,hu8aoi,6,"A very good book. The movie does not capture the book's atmosphere. 

The typical book is better than movie. 

I love Ghibli movies. This is the only Ghibli anime I can't really watch though when this book is in it's own level. Loved the book from young.

I really do rec this though. 

Harper Collins published this last time.☆

Well to OP. If they see this. I rec Harper Collins' modern children classics. I believed it was called. This was in early 2000s. They had lovely lists. But I can't find a link or image of these books to link."

3074,hu8aoi,4,"Read tales from earthsea! The movie is not that good, but the source material is great!"
3075,hu8aoi,9,God i love that movie so much.
3076,hu8aoi,6,When Marnie Was There is another book that became a ghibli film!
3077,hu8aoi,14,"To be more accurate, he ""cleaned up"" the translation, made it more accessible to the English-speaking audience."
3078,hu8aoi,3,I am desperately trying to find another book like The House in the Cerulean Sea bc I’m reading it right now and don’t want it to end!!
3079,hu8aoi,6,I saw it on cable like 10 years ago randomly. My teenaged ass was so bored and just picked a random movie and god I'm glad I did. It changed my view on things seeing as I was basically a country gremlin from timbuktu.
3080,hu8aoi,3,"Well, he is credited with ""writing"" the script for the English dub. It is a bit of a grey area though, given that he would have been working from a translation.

3087,hub72r,3,Came to recommend same!
3088,hujp2w,3,How about storm of steel? It’s the ww1 memoirs of Ernst junger. While probably not exactly what you are envisioning . It has the dangerous lands and a warrior.
3089,hujp2w,37,"Man, go read The Gunslinger by Stephen King"
3090,hujp2w,6,The Chronicals of the Unbeliever series has a bit of this. Stephan R. Donaldson.
3091,hujp2w,3,"Alright yeah, as you said maybe not *exactly* what I was looking for, but I will definitely check it out, thank you!"
3092,hujp2w,5,"Alright, your bluntness (and your amount of upvotes compared to my post's, mostly the bluntness though) has convinced me, this will probably be the next book I read hahah, thank you very much!"
3093,hujp2w,7,"Ah, sai, you will see how the man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed"
3094,hujp2w,3,"I really can't say because I read it in spanish, but there two versions of the Gunslinger in spanish ""El pistolero"" and ""La hierba del diablo"" which are the same books but with different title. I of course would recommend u to buy the one with The Gunslinger title because for me it's the updated version.

I'm truly glad that u are considering of reading the book. If u do so, please let me know what u think of it."
3095,hujp2w,7,You might like The Warded Man by Peter Brett.
3096,hujp2w,3,The Ronin by William Dale Jennings
3097,hujp2w,3,Fate of the Fallen by Kel Kade might be a good fit!
3098,hujp2w,3,"Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb, to some extent. Main character isn't always alone, but if you're looking to research how others have written assassin tales you shouldn't skip it. Then read the rest of the Realm of the Elderlings books because they're awesome."
3099,hujp2w,3,"Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton, it’s what The 13th Warrior is based on. Not Crichton’s best work and maybe not exactly what you’re looking for, but your question made me think of it"
3100,hujp2w,3,"""The Book of the New Sun""  by Gene Wolfe.In the first parts of the series,our protagonist is not alone(he is a member of a guild),but then he gets exiled and goes on a long journey."
3101,hujp2w,3,The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe is this all over. Also perhaps the best series written since the 80s
3102,hujp2w,3,"Yeah someone else also suggested this, out of all the suggestions that might be my favorite, the fact that you also suggested it and your high words of it had only made me more intrigued, I have to read it soon, thank you very much!"
3103,hujp2w,3,Awesome. Very glad. You will not regret it.
3104,hukhnq,4,"Some of my favorites:

- *The Emperor of All Maladies* by Siddhartha Mukherjee (a biography of cancer)

- *Parasite Rex* by Carl Zimmer (parasites, biology)

- *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert (ecology)

- *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker

- *Seven Brief Lessons on Physics* by Carlo Rovelli"
3105,humicw,5,The Glass Hotel by Emily St John Mandel (which came out earlier this year)
3106,humicw,3,"There's *Into The Wild* if you're able to connect properly. Otherwise try *The Alcehmist* by Paolo Coelho. It's almost a cliché to mention it, but it is that good. Albeit in a completely different social stream to *On The Road*."
3107,huqhay,11,"Margaret Atwood, George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury are good writers to start with after that list. I'd also recommend Clockwork Orange."
3108,huqhay,3,"The Iliad. 
Don’t settle."
3109,huqhay,4,"I'll second all those for sure! And it's so good to see another fan of *A Clockwork Orange*. 

OP:

If you liked *Slaughterhouse 5* and *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, you'll have to check out *Catch-22* by Joseph Heller (and slowly work your way into his other works if you want to be a writer).

Peter Carey's short stories in *The Fat Man in History* just overflow with imagination.

Try some Jean-Paul Sartre and more Kurt Vonnegut for further existentialism.

But if you want to be a writer and want to know where to go next? There's only one answer. Start writing."
3110,huqhay,4,"I would recommend The Trial by Franz Kafka.

Right now I'm reading The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky and some of the characters definitely exhibit existential conflict. So you may like that as well."
3111,huqhay,3,"Definitely read Catch-22 and the Secret History, two of the best books I've ever read and judging from your list they'd be right up your street. When I was in my teens I loved the Perks of Being a Wallflower (I still do) so I'd recommend that as well"
3112,huqhay,3,"John Steinbeck, Hemingway but only for whom the bell tolls. If you want to write also read some trash that is popular. Good luck"
3113,huqhay,3,I highly recommend Voltaire’s Candide and The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. They both have such a mesmerizing style to them that really hits the philosophical point home without feeling stuffy or overbearing.
3114,huui4r,4,"There’s a series I just read that might fit the bill; the innkeeper chronicles. The main character is able to bend physics to a point within a certain realm of influence and there’s a very strict set of rules about who can know. Aliens are involved. ETA: this is very light reading. Kind of silly, but fun and more interesting than I anticipated 

There’s also a fanfic (I loathe fanfic for the most part, but this one is supposed to be phenomenal) called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality that I haven’t yet read but comes HIGHLY recommended from a number of sources and ‘adapts Harry Potter by attempting to explain wizardry through the scientific method.’

If you like epic fantasy the sword of truth series has more rules than any fiction book I’ve ever encountered. You need copious notes to track the ‘Wizards rules’ and various prophesies. It’s also got the best example of true neutral I’ve come across."
3115,huui4r,3,"Try Anne McCaffrey's Dragonflight and see if it sparks your interest. It's ESP and complex alien biology, not magic, but it's rationally consistent and thoroughly explored. If you like it, there's a whole series called the Dragonriders of Pern."
3116,huui4r,7,"The DC Peter Grant series is a lot like this. Main char finds out about magic, starts to learn it, and explores it's rules/limits. First book is called Rivers of London (or Midnight Riot in the states I think)"
3117,huwewn,20,Packing for Mars by Mary Roach is super accessible
3118,huwewn,10,Try **Packing for Mars** by Mary Roach.
3119,huwewn,3,"Factfulness by Hans Rosling could perhaps be nice.
There are other books but I don't remember them right now in the middle of the night."
3120,huwewn,3,"Any of Sam Keans books, except maybe the Violinists Thumb."
3121,huwewn,70,The Martian
3122,huwewn,33,Astrophysics for People in a Hurry book by Neil deGrasse Tyson
3123,huwewn,4,Isaac Asimov.
3124,huwewn,29,"A short history of nearly everything by Bill Bryson is a highly readable, funny, approachable book about history of science and our world and universe. It’s fantastic!"
3125,huwewn,5,"Came to say this. I’m a little more adept at physics, but I still love and read this book."
3126,huwewn,5,Cosmos by Carl Sagan
3127,huwewn,6,And if you listen to the audiobook version (like I did on my commute) it’s actually read by Neil which is awesome. Great book.
3128,huwewn,3,I may get a lot of hate for this.. But is it better than the movie? The movie was pretty boring. Love the concept but the scenes were so drawn out
3129,huwewn,3,A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. It was written in a casual language and at the same time highly fascinating. Finished it when I was 12.
3130,huwewn,17,"i just finished this one 2 days ago, so its fresh. there is some technical stuff, but its all explained and the narrator is very funny"
3131,huwewn,7,"Are you looking for something educational and informative? Or sci-fi novels?

If it's the first, I'd recommend: Packing for Mars by Mary Roach or Astrophysics for people in a hurry by Neil deGrass Tyson.

If it's the second, I'd recommend: Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, Red Rising by Pierce Brown or The three body problem by Liu Cixin"
3132,huwewn,3,"Does he give a good performance? In my experience, audiobooks read by their own authors are terrible compared to professional voice actors doing it. It’s probably different for Tyson though since he has such an amazing voice.


https://youtu.be/9D05ej8u-gU

Also, I can’t talk about Tyson and not share this video. Makes me tear up every time"
3133,huwewn,5,I love his voice. I’m really picky about audio book actors and will return a book in the first five minutes if I can’t get past the voice. He’s not an expert but I loved it.
3134,huwewn,3,"Chris Hadfield’s “An astronauts guide to life on Earth”.

While it’s got some self-help/life lessons vibes, I found the scientific information extremely interesting."
3135,huwewn,3,Hitchhikers Guide and Red Rising are among my favorites now.
3136,huwewn,4,"I might just be extra dumb, but I personally had to stop reading it. I felt like I was just skimming a big chunk of the book because of the math and chemistry, etc. Maybe I’ll try again."
3137,huwewn,4,Seconded! I came here to recommend the exact same book!
3138,huwewn,6,"i think part of it is that you dont have to get it. yeah, there were certainly parts that i just skimmed, but it always ended with a dumbed down ""im such a nerd this is the jist of it"" explanation. 

like a page and a half of the man trying to figure out how many potatos he needs through calculations. and in the end hes just like i need a ton. like 5x as many as i currently planned, so here we go! put dirt on the bunk beds, and cover every table, floor, etc. 

like actually remembering what a mol is from chemistry isnt important to the vibe and enjoyability of the story."
3139,huwyvc,9,"It's hard to think of anything like that. **Riptide** by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child is about an island off the coast of Maine where a pirate buried his treasure and protected it with frankly ridiculous booby traps. If you're familiar with Oak Island, this is clearly based on that but there's actually something down there. It's a thriller with the people who are going after the treasure being just as dangerous as the traps themselves. Pretty good read."
3140,huwyvc,3,"These are definitely YA but what about Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series? There's definitely a treasurer hunt. There is also crime, but not in the ""solve the crime"" way. More committing them to solve the puzzle.  

While they are YA fiction, I really enjoyed them."
3141,huwyvc,10,"Mr Penumbra's 24hr Bookstore by Robin Sloan isn't really a scavenger hunt, but it's about a load of riddles and clues around a secret society and I think would fit the bill."
3142,huwyvc,3,"Idk if it’s a mystery as much as they are adventure novels but I really like Clive Cussler books. Especially “Atlantis Found” there was some objects found in a cave and the main character, Dirk Pitt, has to figure out what the object is from and how it plays into certain current situations"
3143,huyhlv,4,The Humans by Matt Haig.
3144,huyhlv,10,"Haven’t read the Bradbury one but I read the other two and while I absolutely loved both, they are super upsetting! What makes you classify them as optimistic?"
3145,huyhlv,10,Lillith's Brood by Octavia Butler
3146,huyhlv,17,"You might enjoy some Cory Doctorow. A lot of his books are about disasters that manage to result in utopias rather than dystopias due to humans not being the feral monsters we’re trained to think they are. The characters go through hell, but they eventually get to a better place than they started. I would say the best example of this is his novel Walkaway."
3147,huyhlv,58,"So...Dune is out, I think. 

Good Omens by Neil Gamin and Terry Pratchett is not sci-fi, it's fantasy. But damn is it good. And uplifting.

Maybe Altered Carbon? It's ...upsetting. But the end can kind of be uplifting? Sort of?



The Martian by Andy Weir! That's the closest I've come to uplifting sci-fi.

And also Leviathan Wakes by James Corey. It's sci-fi and parts of it are uplifting. More uplifting than Dune or Altered Carbon at least.  There are also sad parts and scary parts but..."
3148,huyhlv,387,"Can I be the first to introduce you to my new favorite niche subgenre of speculative fiction: Hopepunk. It's that genre that deals with the struggle against oppression, the strive of humanity to better itself and the fundamental idea that we can make things better.

It was coined, but not invented by Alexandra Rowland, who wrote a Conspiracy of Truths, which is on my list, but I have not yet read. 

It goes back a surprisingly long time; the first books I remember reading that really hit this theme were the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson. They do an excellent job of telling human stories in science fiction settings. 

Terry Pratchett does a pretty good job of it in a fantasy setting. His Tiffany Aching books especially are all about the struggle and power that comes from understanding and embracing yourself. 

A Song for a New Day by Sarah Pinsker does a really good job of putting the 'punk' into hopepunk. It's set in a very prescient near future where disease and violence have lead to a world where social distancing is the norm and mass gatherings don't happen. But the book isn't about that, it's about what we lost when we gave up those things, and how we can regain them.

Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents is pretty dark, but it has a core of hope that keeps it from ever really being grim.

N.K. Jemisin's Broken Earth trilogy does a really good job of the same. It's set in a world where everything has fallen apart, but there's still just enough hope keeping things together that."
3149,huyhlv,7,The culture series is very optimistic!
3150,huyhlv,7,"It is a little bit of a tough request, if only for the fact that science fiction started off as a way to magnify our own flaws as a species and to warn ourselves that those are bad paths to go down, but there are a few that stuck out for me over the years.

Some of the older Star Trek books are pretty good.  I loved Uhura's Song and The Tears of the Singers, although it has been a very long time since I read the latter, the first one the only enemy is a pandemic, and the main character is Uhura.  I really love Uhura's Song and have read it several times since Covid started.  It's funny, and sweet, and has real emotion with a happy ending while still having heart stopping moments and the emotional impact of the disease on the medical staff.  And it has bipedal talking cats with prehensile tails. The show itself was based around the idea of a Utopian society, I always loved it more than Star Wars for that reason alone.  

David Weber writes some great stuff, and his Honor Harrington has a female main character and her Queen is black, the whole royal family is.  It has it's depressing moments, but what good story doesn't, and it has a lot of good moments too, with people working hard to fix things.

Anne McCaffery's PERN series is great.  A lot of good female characters and main characters but it is a blend of scifi and fantasy depending on where you are in the series.  It also starts off chronologically with colonists fleeing a war torn human empire, but the rest of the series has almost nothing at all to do with anything off their own planet, and it has telepathic dragons.  She also wrote the Crystal Singer series, which is a great trilogy that showcases an interesting planet in an interesting and very full colonized galaxy.  Definitely a positive future on the whole."
3151,huyhlv,26,"Lilith’s Brood, by Octavia Butler. It’s actually a trilogy, but they’re excellent, female and POC protagonists, and is actually pretty hopeful in the end.

Broken earth trilogy, by NK Jemisin is also fantastic. POC female protagonist, fascinating world building, dark but not hopeless!"
3152,huyhlv,14,"Ok, this might be a little different, but I'd like to suggest one of my favorite accessible science/media websites: Singularity Hub. It has all sorts of articles about cool sci-fi concepts but ones that are being developed right now/on their way. I find it very optimistic especially since many of the articles describe ways to tackle current problems. Sorry it's not a book, but the website literally helped transform me from a pessimist to an optimist when it comes to the future"

In the large scheme of things yes, the Netflix series followed the plot of the book.I have to say that I enjoyed the first book in the series more than the first season of the Netflix show, and I honestly enjoy the Netflix series. I watched it first and went back to find the books. They are different enough that you definitely get more out of the book."

3157,huyhlv,23,"I missed your PS. Get thee to Ancillary Justice by Anne Lecke.  Gender is presented as mostly female, as in the use of female pronouns are prevalent.

Will really make you appreciate the beauty of the universe and the pursuit of understanding things  and all the things good hopeful sci-fin should inspire in you.

The same authors other book A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet is a great found family novel of a crew on a ship loaded with neat sci-fi concepts about humans exploring the galaxy and forming cross species understanding. The perfect does of hopeful for these times."

Coupled with the second book he builds a world with a brighter, believable, and more optimistic future for humanity than anything else I’ve ever read. It’s not without problems (What book is?) but the strengths far outweigh them. The audiobook is also quite well narrated."
3171,huyhlv,4,"Robert A. Heinlein. Stranger in a Strange Land. Or, for something utterly bonkers, Red Planet.

I really enjoyed Neal Stephenson’s Seveneves, but I’m not sure if that could be considered “uplifting”.

Sort of sci fi (it’s set in space, but deals with necromancy): Gideon the Ninth.

Jo Walton. Among Others. (Again, kind of a mix of sci fi and fantasy, with a bit of childhood wistfulness thrown in.)

Saga by Brian K. Vaughan: both uplifting and not. The world is screwed, but there’s hope for individuals. Also, if you haven’t read it by now, you should."

3173,huyhlv,6,Why is Dune out?  I found it very uplifting.
3174,huyhlv,4,"I recommend An Absolutely Remarkable Thing and its sequel (which just came out a few weeks ago) A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor by Hank Green. The story, particularly the sequel, is in many ways very relatable given the current situation of the world. Sci Fi, takes place in modern time, somewhat diverse cast."
3175,huyhlv,3,"An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Green, and it’s sequel, A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor"
3176,huyhlv,3,"I’ve just started listening on audiobook to Larry Niven’s Ringworld. It’s got similar stuff to Becky Chamber’s series, but what I like even more about it is that Niven published this in 1970. It’s OLD SCHOOL space sci fi and it’s been really entertaining. The narrator is really funny, too.

I’m only about 14% into the first book and I’d just started it this morning. Been listening nonstop all day today while my baby sleeps on me. If you’re a fan of space stories with a bases around a “motley crew” (Firefly, Star Trek), you’ll love this old school sci-fi series."
3177,huyhlv,33,"The Culture novels by Iain M. Banks.

There's plenty of your typical drama and action as is fitting for most any decent sci-fi novel, but the whole premise of the civilisation is that they ""made it"". 

They made AI, which then proceeded to better itself to the point that no human could possibly hope to understand its workings. AI now controls literally everything, but has taken out upon itself to act as a sort of custodian for the universe, helping out less advanced species, including humans. Most books are set post-scarcity, and The Culture have no need for money. Interestingly enough, though these books have been being written for over 30 years now, there's a curious analogue with today's world - clout. The only thing that most people really care about is their social standing, as there is no wealth when you can literally order up a floating mountain with a house on it if you feel like. People are much more concerned with not doing or saying things that would cause others to lose respect for them. People can change sex at will, though it takes a year or so, so most successful couples will have 1 child each, taking turns as the mother and father etc.

Ships are also run by AI, though they each have quirks of character that make them better or worse suited to certain jobs (exploration, hauling, policing, special missions etc). There are also interactions with other species and civilisations, possibly either less or more advanced, and usually without the same desire to have a net positive effect on the universe.

The first book I read, and the one I personally recommend to anyone new to the series is called ""The Player Of Games"", and is quite an easy book to get into compared with some of the others, as Banks has quite a dry, analytical writing style that some don't get on with. It also primarily takes place in another civilisation that has more parallels with our own, so you get a good introduction to The Culture from all the comparisons that get made between him and the citizens of the world he's visiting."
3178,huyhlv,3,"I don’t know if it technically counts as sci if, but An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green is pretty optimistic. The sequel just came out, but I haven’t read it yet."
3179,huyhlv,3,"Apologies, not a book, but start listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Start with the episode 'My Mom'. If a heart wrenching conversation between a son and mother conversing about her terminal cancer and how it brought her closer to love, appreciating life, and finding peace with death doesn't give you hope in life I'm not sure what will. Every episode is all over the place with the guests Duncan talks to but each time I listen I feel happier and fuller after. Ultimately, I hope you find the thing(s) that make you feel full and find hope."
3180,huyhlv,5,"Was going to suggest this author. I love the Wayfarer trilogy (Long way to a small angry planet, a close and uncommon orbit and record of a space born few)"
3181,huyhlv,4,This is one of my top books of the year. It is fabulous and definitely fills the hopeful request.
3182,huyhlv,3,"Came here for this one.

Stranger in a strange land is top 3 best books I've ever read. Moving unlike few others. Can not recommend enough."
3183,huyhlv,5,three body problem— fantastic trilogy i found in a book store in burlington. expanded my consciousness greatly.
3184,huyhlv,8,"Not a book, but maybe watch Adventure Time. It scratches a few itches."
3185,huyhlv,9,"Although on paper you wouldn't think *Station Eleven* sounded optimistic, I think ultimately it is a very positive book about the indomitable human spirit. And a great read!"
3186,huyhlv,8,"Altered Carbon really bummed me out. So bleak. I like bleak, but that one, that one was bad."
3187,huyhlv,5,"Ready Player One ~ Ernest Cline

This book is a very simple read but fun and engaging. The story also helped me adjust my own perspective on life in general and how I gauge my health and happiness."
3188,huyhlv,3,I love Cory Doctorow’s work!
3189,huyhlv,6,"I feel Leviathan wakes can go either way, there are some parts of it pretty grim but some parts pretty uplifting, i feel it is a kind of realistic/normal sci fi.

Another suggestion in the same vein is Bobiverse and Murderbot. Really nice stories not so feel good but not so grim."
3190,huyhlv,3,"Murderbot!  It checks all your boxes.  It’s super funny and has great POC and female characters. There’s currently 4 novellas and 1 novel, with more novellas and another novel on the way.  First novella is **All Systems Red**.

Part of the setting is under a kind of depressing corporatized space gov’t but the way the main characters deal with it is really uplifting and inspiring.  I’ve read it about 3 times this year already, it’s one of the only things that has really cheered me up and distracted me from the crazy shit going on (aside from finally getting into Clone Wars/Rebels and the wait for Mando 2)."
3191,huyhlv,16,"Thanksfor thr new genre, will totally check it out.

I love Octavia Butler's Parables books but i don't think they are uplifting at all, I can see they have an uplifting foundation but i feel they hit pretty hard on the problems of society that it isn't so uplifting. 

Edit: grammar."
3192,huyhlv,5,Was also going to recommend Becky Chambers. Sounds like something the OP is looking for. Brilliant books!
3193,huyhlv,3,"Going by plot alone, it's hard to find something super uplifting because, y'know, conflict and stuff, but I think The Expanse series (which begins with Leviathan Wakes) has what OP is looking for. It posits a world of the future where humanity has branched out and (most of the) struggles of today are mere footnotes and does it in a mostly believable way."
3194,huyhlv,4,I’d put Cory Doctorow’s Walkaway in this category too. I can’t stop thinking of that book.
3195,huyhlv,3,The Moomins maybe
3196,huyhlv,4,"Seconding the Project Hieroglyph anthology, it's a perfect fit. From the ""About"" section on the [website](https://hieroglyph.asu.edu/about/):

&gt; What science fiction stories—and the symbols that they engender—can do better than almost anything else is to provide not just an idea for some specific technical innovation, but also to supply a coherent picture of that innovation being integrated into a society, into an economy, and into people’s lives. Often, this is the missing element that scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and entrepreneurs need in order to actually take the first real steps towards realizing some novel idea.
&gt; While the mission of Project Hieroglyph begins with creative inspiration, our hope is that many of us will be genuinely inspired towards realization."
3197,huyhlv,6,"Came here to recommend this too, it's my go to series when I need something positive. It's really well written, a gripping story, and just really refreshing for being so different:

* It takes place in a large, galaxy spanning, and militaristic empire. But it also deals with the amount of diversity within a society that large, and takes place at a time of transition.
* The society is an interesting mix of very progressive ideas (there's no recognized genders for example so any styles of clothing or jobs or behavior are common for anyone, everyone is called ""she"" in translation, but it's really filling in for gender neutral pronouns), plus lots of little hang ups and interesting cultural norms. For example things like gloves and specific kinds of jewelry are very important in specific ways
* It's a trilogy, and each book tells a different kind of story. Mostly the same characters, but very different kinds of character arcs
* Some of the characters are ships or AIs, and that's done in a very interesting way. Plus there's sometimes aliens, and they're not written as being like humans but a little different. Instead they're completely different to the point that we can barely understand the way each other thinks, and that's actually a very fun twist

Overall I think it really ticks all of OPs requirements, and I love recommending the series to anyone just because it's so good and so different than most sci-fi.

There's two other series that also I like to read when I need something positive:

* The Culture series (you can read it in any order, but starting with *The Player of Games* is a common recommendation). It also has interesting characters, including lots of drones/ships/AI, in a very progressive and advanced society
* *Diary of a Murderbot* a series of novellas that are quick and very fun and generally hopeful and uplifting."
3198,huyhlv,3,"Have you ever read Vorkosigan books by Luis McMaster Bujold? They are fabulous and women are kick ass, as are some of the men too. I love them so much!  


Jim Butcher's Furies of Caldernon has great characters too. His stories give me hope.

Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik has some excellent storytelling and people in it."
3199,huyhlv,3,"I second Lilith’s Brood, OP! Especially the second and third books for what you’re looking for, but the whole plot of the series is *literally* about reviving hope for humanity after a catastrophic and apocalyptic world war. My favorite series!!"
3200,huyhlv,7,"Hope was too strong a word for what they left me with after the brutality in there, but it was in that vein, and it was positive.

She was a hell of a writer."
3201,huyhlv,3,"I mean, I love Octavia Butler, and the Lilith's Brood trilogy was great, but I would not consider them uplifting in any sense. They're pretty much as bleak as you can get."
3202,huyhlv,3,"They aren't particularly new, but the most hopefully science fiction I can think of is The Callahan Chronicles. The first book is a collection of short stories originally written in the 70s and 80s, and they are the most wholesome and hopeful stories I've ever read. They are technically now set in the past, so many of the stories don't totally fit you looking for the future of humanity, but they all give you hope for humanity.

The second suggestion I have is actually set in the far future, so it's more what you are looking for. I highly recommend the Vorkosigan Saga. They deal with plenty of bad things humans do, but the theme of the series is taking things as they are and working incredibly hard to make them better. The idea is that even if you can't do things the way everyone else does, that's fine, you can still find a way to follow your dreams. It's the only book series I know where the big action hero is under five feet tall and has incredibly brittle bones. They also do some interesting stuff with gender, but it's not the focus of most of the books."
3203,huyhlv,3,You clearly need to read the Callahan Chronicles. They are the most uplifting science fiction I have ever read. Arguably the most the most uplifting book I have ever read. They are basically all about empathy and caring for the people who come into your life.
3204,huyhlv,6,"I started reading Parable of the Sower just as Trump was gaining steam in the Republican primaries, and I had to put it down. The parallels were just too strong and have gotten worse if anything."
3205,huyhlv,3,I would also recommend his Void trilogy
3206,huyhlv,3,"Oh my god, I kept feeling like I was losing my mind while reading that one, it was so bizarre. It was so unlike the rest of Cory's stuff I'd read (well, apart from the fixation on a technological project that benefited a lot of people that was just sort of shoe-horned into the story) :D"
3207,huyhlv,3,"Weird, I totally thought OP had mentioned Becky Chambers and The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet specifically as an example of something she'd already enjoyed."
3208,hv22v8,3,"Roald Dahl has some macabre stories, but even though they’re really good they aren’t horror. Stalker by Lars Kepler gave me chills by how creepy it is, but again not horror.

3209,hv22v8,3,Sounds intriguing and just what looking for

3212,hv22v8,3,"The Fall of the House of Usher (though if you're a fan of  Edgar Allen Poe, you probably have read it)"
3213,hv3tu7,10,"Ok so first of all philosophy authors generally suck at being clear with what they’re talking abt. The first author I ever read was Kant and that was a BAD IDEA. I didn’t understand shit. 

I recommend starting with Rachel Jaeggi’s alienation because it’s fairly easy to understand in terms of philosophy and it’ll actually help you understand Kant later anyway (and if you’re a going to be a philosophy person knowing Kant is important). Baudrillard is also fairly easy to understand. I personally haven’t read him outside of school but one of my friends read his book in high school and his philosophy is actually quite simple compared to other post modern authors.

Also, if you want to get into philosophy, I suggest listening to the “philosophize this!” podcast because it’ll summarize various philosophies for you and then you can go in and start reading them. I would consider this an essential step for authors like Kant and Judith Butler, both of whom are notorious for being confusing. The podcast also has extra readings and content available on their website for free! There’s also the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy, which I know helped me a lot."
3214,hv3tu7,5,Meditations by Marcus Aurelius A Roman Emperor Himself.
3215,hv3tu7,3,"If you're interested in Stoicism specifically (it's a philosophy that teaches how externals are independent of you and teaches you to focus only on your inner self) the series by Anderson Silver is a great and short synopsis of this 2000 year old Greek and Roman philosophy that is finding a resurgence in recent times. 

Your User's Manual: This will completely change the way you see the world and live your life. Your priorities will change and you will have a better focus on what you truly want to do. The subtitle is A Guide for Purpose and an Anxiety Free Life in the 21st Century. Knowing what you want to do would help you be more focused, motivated and productive.

Your Duality Within: This is part anthropology and part philosophy. It first explains why we have emotions and think one way but wish we were acting another way. Then it helps you change and better control yourself and your emotional mind. Easier to manage your thoughts when you understand why they are the way they are and how they work."
3216,hv3tu7,3,"I recommend Sophia's World by Jostein Gaarder.
Got me started back in the 90s."

Sophie's World
by Jostein Gaarder 

It’s a fiction book but it is a fantastic way into philosophy that takes you from Greek philosophy to today. That introduces you to philosophical questions, such as ‘why are we here?’, ‘how to live a moral life?’ Etc and tells you how different philosophers have addressed these questions through time. 

I recommend it as a great philosophy book as well as a great book in general. 

Here is the blurb from the book. 

“One day fourteen-year-old Sophie Amundsen comes home from school to find in her mailbox two notes, with one question on each: ""Who are you?"" and ""Where does the world come from?"" From that irresistible beginning, Sophie becomes obsessed with questions that take her far beyond what she knows of her Norwegian village. Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning—but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.”"
3219,hv3tu7,3,I came here to suggest Sophie's World as well; it really gave me a love for philosophy that I totally didn't have before.
3220,hv3tu7,3,"I'd read some Albert Camus. The Stranger, Myth of Sisyphus, The Fall, etc."
3221,hv3tu7,3,"Plato's Republic is great

All of these should be free in the public domain."
3222,hv6rw1,3,"If you don’t mind reading self-help, I would highly recommend The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem by Nathaniel Branden. Very practical and useful."
3223,hv6rw1,7,"When I started a job that let me listen to audiobooks while I worked, I fell into a habit of reading constantly. Looking back, it still surprises me how getting through a book or two a week really changed me as person. I recommend finding the format (audiobook during a commute, e-reader before bed, Tuesday afternoons) that works for you, and stick with it. 

Early on, I would read self help books because they are easy reads, very interesting and simple. They help establish the habit of reading regularly. When I think of books that really changed me, though, it’s books that give me new perspective. I like books written by people who grew up in very different circumstances than me, and books by experts sharing details about their field of interest. 

I don’t recommend trying to force yourself to listen to books you find boring, but you might be surprised what kind of books can capture your attention. There’s nothing wrong with reading any particular genre, so I wouldn’t get hung up on the quality of the books you’re reading, only the quantity. As long as you’re thinking and digesting the thing you’re currently reading and excited about the next thing on your list, you’ll be growing from the experience."
3224,hv6rw1,3,"Maybe *Franny and Zooey* by JD Salinger? It's all about the disillusionment of the youngest member of the Glass family, who is rising into adulthood."
3225,hv6rw1,4,"Why Fish Don’t Exist by Miller.

I would just say read as much as you can. It’s a lesson in empathy and experience. Maybe read some autobiographies of people you admire? I really like Educated by Westover and Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom"
3226,hv6rw1,3,"I agree! I think just reading will probably get OP the results she wants.

I read a LOT growing up and I was always viewed as a ‘mature kid’ not because I was particularly maturer but I think it’s because I read a lot, which broadened my horizons and made me seem less sheltered than most of the people in my community. I think reading fiction helps us develop empathy and exposes us to ideas we never knew and to help change our perspective on things we might have misjudged. 

My suggestion to OP is to visit a bookstore, do some research and compile a list of books that seem interesting. I agree, self help is a good place to start particularly for someone who intends to change something about their life, as self help books get to the point. I absolutely agree with ‘developing a habit’ of reading! 

Start with a few books that seem interesting to you and go from there! I would recommend starting a Goodreads account to help keep track and find books you might like."
3227,hv6rw1,3,"Books like Fahrenheit 451 or My Sister's Keeper. 

They have strong, adult characters that have to deal with very emotionally and practically complex situations. The situations require maturity, advanced problem-solving, and building strong relationships with others. They require thinking in an emotionally mature way and putting yourself in someone else's shoes to try to understand what they're going through.

(Some parts of My Sister's Keeper are narrated by a young girl, but the other parts are narrated by adults.)"

3236,hv7f0l,4,"They are light-hearted and quick reads, but her Royal Spyness series by Rhys Bowen follows a royal cousin who solves mysteries in a world her upbringing did not prepare her for.  She is clever but naïve and she really develops and grows with her experiences.  Rhys Bowen’s Molly Murphy series is similar, following a clever, but oppressed immigrant into America and showing how she navigates the world around her and makes a life for herself.  They are less silly than the Royal Spyness novels."
3237,hv7f0l,3,"I love this question, and I am always looking for brilliant women who write about other brilliant women! I try to make a point of reading mostly women. Here are a few that I don't see recommended often. If you only read one, I suggest making it *The Unnecessary Woman*, because it is hands down one of the most poignant and insightful books I have ever read. 

* *The Lager Queen of Minnesota* by J. Ryan Stradal
* *Kitchens of the Great Midwest* by J. Ryan Stradal--in my opinion, he does a better job than most male writers at writing vivid, imaginative female characters!
* *Lila* by Marilynne Robinson (one of America's greatest living authors!)
* *Winter's Bone* by Daniel Woodrell (creepy, creepy, creepy)
* *Lilian Boxfish Takes a Walk* by Katherine Rooney
* *We Have Always Lived in the Castle* by Shirley Jackson (you may know this author from *The Lottery*, and if you do, you probably have an idea of what to expect from this super weird book).
* *The Unnecessary Woman* by Rabih Alameddine (if you only read one book on this list, make it this one! One of the best female characters I have ever written and one of the books I love the most)."
3238,hv7f0l,5,"Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake by Atwood fit this well.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryx_and_Crake


Dostoyevsky has really rich characters as well. The Idiot and Brothers Karamozov feature complicated women throughout (The Idiot probably more so). 

Greek tragedies are another great source for witty, intelligent, complicated female characters.

Antigone is a classic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles_play)



so is Medea

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea_(play)

but really any play by either playwright should be full of fun stuff."
3239,hv7f0l,3,"&gt;Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake by Atwood fit this well.

I'll second these and add *The Testaments*, also by Atwood and a sequel of sorts to *The Handmaid's Tale*.

Actually, the OP's post is wonderfully refreshing too! Thanks!"
3240,hv7f0l,12,"I'm seconding the Becky Chambers suggestion. The Wayfairer's books are really a happy place for me, they're beautifully written, kind and imaginative. 

I thought Arkaday Martine's A Memory of Empire might work for you. It's a space opera that's almost all courtly drama and politicking, with well written female characters (and a gay sub plot if that matters to you.)

I was trying to think about what Sarah Gailey book to suggest, but I can't choose- everything they write is fantastic, and they do a great job of having a diverse and interesting cast of characters. I really liked Upright Women Wanted, and Magic for Liars was also fantastic.

Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix Harrow is also fantastic. It's a portal fantasy set in Victorian England, only instead of centering a wealthy English kid, it deals with a POC, and how having access to a multitude of other worlds means very different things for a person like that.

Also, if you haven't read N.K. Jemisin's The Cities we Became yet, you really should. I deeply love the Broken Earth trilogy, but being in the main character's head for that long can be rightly exhausting, and The Cities series has a slightly lighter tone and more POV characters."
3241,hv7f0l,11,"I love all the authors you mentioned and want to second the Madeline Miller recommendation! I also love Emily St. John Mandel, although you may not find quite the same depth in all the characters she writes. The Sevenwaters Trilogy by Juliet Marillier is another favorite!"
3242,hv7f0l,5,"Thank you, friend!"
3243,hv7f0l,3,I loved Eve in JD Robb’s In Death series. I’ve always had a problem with flat heroines. Eve is anything but
3244,hv7f0l,3,"Virginia Woolf is in my opinion one of the best of the best. Check out ""To The Lighthouse."" The main character's  interiority is strikingly brilliant both in content and expression."
3245,hv7f0l,4,{{Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine}}

&gt;Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here
&gt;
&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine
&gt;
&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. 
&gt;
&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.
&gt;
&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .

3247,hv7f0l,8,Lila Bard in the Shades of Magic series by V.E. Schwab is wonderful!
3248,hv7f0l,4,I just finished 'The Priory of the Orange Tree' and there's some cool (but not-perfect) women in there! By Samantha Shannon.
3249,hv7f0l,3,I absolutely adore VE Schwab. Vicious and Vengeance by her are also really good with compelling female characters
3250,hv7f0l,5,"I really liked this book. And I don’t really like perfect women characters (I want them to be flawed). Female leads, and a female villain."
3251,hv7f0l,3,"Have you read Arundhati Roy? Maybe not a specific female character per se, but the prose is beautiful. 

I will also add Angela Carter and Sylvia Plath. The first fits both the description and expands your vocabulary, the second is maybe lacking wits, but she knew how to use the English language. Same goes for Virginia Woolf."
3252,hv7f0l,17,"Uprooted by Naomi Novik is pretty great, as well as the Seven Realms Series by Cinda Williams Chima. Both are Fantasy with a strong female protagonist. The Seven Realms Series has several male main charakters as well, though."
3253,hv7f0l,4,"White Teeth, by Zadie Smith

Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie"
3254,hv7f0l,3,Highly recommend The Alice Network.
3255,hv7f0l,3,"If you're a Star Wars fan, there are so many great books that fit here from the new book canon. All of the books with main female characters are written by women, I believe."
3256,hv7f0l,3,"Agreed.

Actually most of Atwood's work is about sharp, strong women."
3257,hv7f0l,3,"Writers and Lovers by Lily King, anything by Jenny Offill, Girl Woman Other, Olive Kitteridge and the sequel, Fates and Furies (wait for the second half for great female character development, trust me!)"
3258,hv7f0l,3,"Endorse the suggestion of The Beekeeper's Apprentice and add the whole Mary Russell series.  My pandemic reading has included rereading the entire series, finishing with the just published book from March.  It's light enough not to be challenging in the sense that you have to work at it, yet the plots are fairly complex, as are the characters, and I still have to look up the occasional word.  Descriptions of settings are rich but don't go on and on and on. I like that one does not find out all about Mary in the very first book, but rather bits and pieces of her personality, values, and history are revealed over the course of the series - same as with someone who is a friend, that you get to know them better over time."
3259,hv7f0l,3,"The Thursday Next books by Jasper Fforde. 

Fans of Douglas Adams and P. G. Wodehouse will love visiting Jasper Fforde's Great Britain, circa 1985, when time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously: it’s a bibliophile’s dream. England is a virtual police state where an aunt can get lost (literally) in a Wordsworth poem and forging Byronic verse is a punishable offense. All this is business as usual for Thursday Next, renowned Special Operative in literary detection. But when someone begins kidnapping characters from works of literature and plucks Jane Eyre from the pages of Brontë's novel, Thursday is faced with the challenge of her career."
3260,hv7f0l,3,"Amazing female characters:

“The Signature of All Things” and “City of Girls” by Elizabeth Gilbert (if you were turned off by “Eat, Pray, Love,” don’t worry; me too. I couldn’t even finish that book! Luckily a friend got me into some other Gilbert stuff and she is truly a fantastic, charming, intriguing writer. Her non fiction book “Committed” is also great.) 


“Bel Canto,” “The Magician’s Assistant,” and “State of Wonder” by Ann Pachett. (Women in VERY different environments with very different skill sets. Pachett is such a great story-teller.)

“Nothing to See Here” by Kevin Wilson (such a hilarious, absurd, dark, witty book!) 

“My Year of Rest and Relaxation” by Ottessa Moshfegh (because you don’t have to be likable to be well-written)

“Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine” - Gail Honeyman (fascinating character study meets page-turner mystery). 

Enjoy!"
3261,hv7f0l,3,"I absolutely agree about depth of characters, but I really liked “The Glass Hotel,” St John Mandel’s newest."
3262,hv7f0l,3,"autumn green from “autoboyography” by christina lauren was pretty much my first thought reading this, even though she’s mostly a side character. her relationship with the mc, to me, is the reason why i think you’d may like her. she stands out on her own and the author does a really good job of building her character while also emphasizing the pure heart and love of her and the mc’s friendship. so maybe that’s something? 

i do agree with one of the other comments that “circe” by madeline miller is definitely a high recommendation; bonus points that it’s in said “intelligent and witty” female character’s pov so there’s that!"
3263,hv7f0l,3,"Assassin's Apprentice and City of Brass are the first books in two fantasy series written by women who have wonderfully rich character development (of both female and male characters). I will say that for Assassin's Apprentice, the perspective of the first 3 books is written from a young boy/man's point of view, but the females are still wonderfully written and there are female PoV's from the 4th book onward."
3264,hv7f0l,3,"Girl, you are speaking my love language. I love reading about kickass women and the women who read and write them. A lot of these authors are current or former academics and lawyers (which I feel lends some extra authenticity to their books), but all these authors are amazing at research/worldbuilding. Book hangovers are real. 

If you like...

Competent, contemporary women (what I call competence porn): 
Laura Griffin - Tracers series (if CSI were books), Rachel Grant (archaeologist) - Evidence series, DD Ayers, Piper J. Drake, Julie James, Penny Reid

Historical: 
Eloisa James, Lisa Kleypas, Mary Balogh, Sarah MacLean

Paranormal: 
Ilona Andrews, Deborah Harkness, Nalini Singh, Kresley Cole, Bec McMaster, Rebecca Zanetti, Renee Ahdieh (her most well known series is a play on 1000 nights), KF Breene - Warrior Chronicles

Agatha Christie/historical mystery:
Barbara Vine (one-offs, detective inspector series as Ruth Rendell). These authors flip between present and past mystery: Simone St. James, Kate Morton 

There’s more where this came from.

3266,hv7f0l,3,"Bonus: Ann Pachett, with a business partner, opened a bookstore in Nashville in 2011, because the bookstores here had closed.  She said, “When our bookstores closed, I waited a respectable period of time, certain that someone more qualified or interested would show some initiative, but it didn’t happen. I opened a bookstore because I didn’t want to live in a city without one.”  It's Parnassus Books.  If you'd like to support an independent  bookstore, you can order from them at 
parnassusbooks.net
Look up Parnassus Books on Instagram to see Ms Pachett in near daily short videos about books.  
I have no connection to this bookstore other than loving it as a customer.  I live nearish to Nashville and have been into the store several times.  It's lovely. Everyone who works there is lovely.  The bookstore dog is lovely."

For more ""whoa! Didn't see that coming!"" I'd recommend pretty much anything by Jodi Picoult. My favorites have been Sing You Home and My Sister's Keeper (and I'd caution you to stay away from Small Great Things)."

&gt;Meet the Cooke family. Our narrator is Rosemary Cooke. As a child, she never stopped talking; now that she's started college, she has wrapped herself in silence: the silence of intentional forgetting, of protective cover. Rosemary is now an only child, but she used to have a sister the same age as her, and an older brother. Both are now gone—vanished from her life. Her once lively mother is a shell of her former self, her clever and imperious father now a distant, brooding man. And there was something unique about Rosemary's sister, Fern.
&gt;You'll have to find out for yourself what it is that makes her unhappy family unlike any other.

3291,hvacaa,5,{{The Wasp Factory}}
3292,hvacaa,9,"The queens thief series by Megan Whalen Turner. The kind of books where you won’t see anything coming but when you read it the second time you realize she has been perfectly crafting every little thing. Also amazing characters that I love 
(It goes: The Thief, The Queen of Attolia, The King of Attolia, A Conspiracy of Kings, Thick as Thieves, and the final book will be called Return of the Thief)"
3293,hvacaa,10,Fantastic book imo. I loved it &lt;3
3294,hvacaa,16,"I really enjoyed Small Great Things, but hated A Spark of Light. The Storyteller was my favourite of hers though."
3295,hvacaa,15,"Fingersmith by Sarah Waters. 1800’s ish (I think?) lesbian drama about a woman who goes to work as a maid for this super wealthy guy and his niece. The maid is on a mission to swindle this family out of everything with the help of a crooked “friend” named Gentleman. I really thought I had this book figured out, I was like oh ha ha you think she ends up with the guy but whoa ho ho lesbians. I was right, but I was also so so wrong to think it was the only twist. This book started slow, but then it went pedal to the metal, 0 to 60 in .5 seconds. Couldn’t put it down after this twist.

If you don’t want to read the whole thing, the Korean movie “The Handmaiden” as well as the BBC adaptation “Fingersmith” are both super well done and handle this twist so perfectly."
3296,hvacaa,21,"If you like science fiction, Cixin Liu's Three Body Problem trilogy has some amazing twists. Or more even than a twist, the plot just opening up in big and surprising ways."

3298,hvacaa,3,"I think so, never seen the movie actually, but it has good actors"
3299,hvacaa,12,"Small Great Things was okay in the sense that it was well-written, but it just seemed to be very racially insensitive. I mean, she had slurs through the book. And a white lawyer taking on a race-motivated case and saying that bring up race was going to make them lose. And just so much more. I could list it all out but I don't know that anyone's interested haha. I don't think Jodi Picoult had ill intentions writing it, but I don't think it came across in a productive way. 

I'm going to agree with you on A Spark of Light though; the reverse chronology was not the best."
3300,hvacaa,8,The Last Mrs Parrish! So twisty!
3301,hvacaa,6,"It does!! If I remember correctly, the movie plot stayed pretty close to the book's plot (except in a few places; which in movies I they pretty much have to do that to be able to convert a good book's flow into a good movie's flow and still keep it really cohesive).

But I went and stayed with my grandmother for a few days a few years ago and I saw it on her ""To Watch"" list (which I thought was pretty funny considering my grandmother is over eighty years old; she's also a fervent reader like I am and has more books than she can count, just like me, but she hadn't read it), so I mentioned to her that I'd read it and remembered it being really good. So we started watching it together at about 2 am, haha. She loved it, and asked to borrow the book as soon as the credits rolled."

3311,hvacaa,5,The Mistborn Series by Brandon Sanderson!
3312,hvacaa,12,"I always did this too when I read paper books. I really ruined *1984* in high school. 

It's just a nice way to orient yourself to the book--look at the title, publishing page, table of contents, flip through for the general font and chapter style, number of chapters, number of pages, and last page. It's actually taught to kids learning to read for early reading books as a way to increase literacy, and it makes sense that people don't stop doing it as they advance in reading ability."
3313,hvacaa,11,The Red Rising by Pierce Brown
3314,hvacaa,27,Basically anything by Lisa Jewell - her books are a combination of psychological thrillers and whodunits that keep you guessing till the very end! Would definitely recommend The Family Upstairs.

3317,hvacaa,35,"I would suggest not reading Murder on the Orient Express first if you have never read one of Agatha Christie’s novels before. 

It’s better to get accustomed to the way that she writes plotlines and twists (like with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Death on the Nile, or The Mysterious Affair at Styles) and *then* move on to Orient. I can’t explain why without spoiling too much, but I think it’s much more shocking that way. Trust me!"

3319,hvacaa,3,Don't you think that asking for plot twist books ruins the whole plot twist thing?
3320,hvacaa,29,Is it the same as movie or little bit different?
3321,hvacaa,8,"Seconding The Silent Patient, but I guessed the ending of Sharp Objects just from the blurb on the back.  I feel like Gone Girl was a one-hit wonder.

Granted, I also think Jodi Piccoult writes vapid deus-ex-machina garbage and everyone else here loves her, so I guess take my opinion with a grain of salt.

Edit: coming in to actually recommend a book that I was coincidentally already reading when someone lent me The Silent Patient.  The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary by Simon Winchester.  I thought it was pretty dry and struggled through it, but I learned a lot more about the asylum in The Silent Patient.  In The Professor and the Madman, there's a moment towards the end that isn't a plot twist, but it's way out of left field and I certainly didn't see it coming.  I know it's nonfiction AND it sounds boring as hell, but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.  I didn't want to read it either, but I was desperately bored.  I think reading them concurrently made an already great read  (Silent Patient) even better.

Honestly I need to re-read The Silent Patient.  It really is a fantastic book."
3322,hvacaa,6,"Agreed. I read Murder on the Orient Express first because it was required reading in junior high, and I will forever feel robbed because it didn't have the same punch for me that other people have described."

3327,hvacaa,8,The ending of I’m Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid pretty much demands that you re-read the whole book
3328,hvacaa,83,"I haven’t read the book in a few years and I’ve only seen the movie once but I think the movie follows the books pretty well. I think there’s just something about the book and it being in writing where I was just like “oh my god holy shit”. Like when the second half of the book starts, it does a complete 180 on her part and you find out a bunch of shit and what she all did. From what I remember there was a gradual shift in the movie where things came out while in the book you had a legit “flip of the switch” and it was something you never saw coming"

3342,hvacaa,33,"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd rattled me. You instinctively know who it is, but Agatha Christie manages to make me feel stupid for even thinking about suspecting said culprit, so I put them aside until it all just exploded in the last few chapters. My favourite book by Christie. And Then There Were None is also good, but it didn't leave such an impression on me like Ackroyd."
3343,hvacaa,10,"Yeah the film was based on the book. The book is written as letters from the mother, I think the ways it’s written is way more impactful as the story is drawn out-well worth a read."

3347,hvacaa,8,"David Fincher did an amazing adaptation of the book and personally I found the film to the better. 

With the book you can get to know more regarding why the characters are that way and the reasons that motivate them to do those actions. You can get a better character sketch in the book but at times the book was a slog to read while the film adaptation was riveting."
3348,hvacaa,3,"To go off of Dark Matter, I’d recommend The Gone World. Knocked my goddamn socks off."
3349,hvacaa,9,"Atonement, by Ian McEwan"
3350,hvacaa,3,"“Behind her eyes” literally one of the most interesting novels iv read this year ... and yes with a slap on the face of a plot twist

 (btw don’t look anythinggg up about this book before you read it) 

+ audiobook is on youtbe and is excellent"
3351,hvacaa,20,I just wanna set here and brag about me predicting that one 👀
3352,hvacaa,4,Loved that one!
3353,hvacaa,5,Could you describe it? No spoilers please.
3354,hvacaa,8,I just read The Turn of the Key by Ruth Ware and I did not see that ending coming. The MC was so annoying but the ending left me speechless.
3355,hvacaa,3,“The wife between us” I still can’t recover from that twist
3356,hvacaa,4,Yes yes yes.. this is actually kinda my favorite suspenseful thriller .. the whole time i was so scared of where its going until it went there .. and then slapped me on the face with a twist 😂
3357,hvacaa,43,We don't talk about that
3358,hvacaa,16,"We were liars by e.lockhart, it makes you question the whole book!"
3359,hvacaa,6,"You've never seen the movie? If you don't know this twist, you'd better read the book or watch the movie ASAP.  I can't think of a greater plot twist."
3360,hvacaa,3,The Sanderlanche is real. Warbreaker and Starsight are my favorites for those.
3361,hvacaa,5,The Silent Patient
3362,hvacaa,6,"Wow, me too. I’ve never read of anyone/ heard anyone talking about how they like to read the last sentence before. :’)"
3363,hvacaa,3,SUCH a great book. And genuinely shocking twists. Sarah Waters is incredible
3364,hvacaa,16,"I read it in an airplane and gasped so loudly that the person next to me asked if I was okay. Finished on that same flight because, god, I had to know the end. 10/10"
3365,hvacaa,12,I’ve always been in the read-before-watching camp but for some reason this didn’t happen with Sharp Objects. I’m so glad because that series was just phenomenal for me. I remember feeling so stressed and sympathetic and just everything so many emotions. It left me reeling.
3366,hvacaa,7,"I was like ""Whaaaaaaat?"" the first time I read it"
3367,hvacaa,5,Just a habit I picked up when I was younger!
3368,hvacaa,14,I’m sorry but Lois Lowrys The Giver psychologically terrorized me at age 10!
3369,hvacaa,20,And really anything by Lianne Moriarty. But especially this one :)
3370,hvacaa,3,I agree about Jodi Picoult.  I also recommend Small Great Things and Plain Truth was good as well.
3371,hvacaa,11,Anything by Tana French. But I was most shocked at the end by Into The Woods.
3372,hvacaa,4,Oh yes I Let You Go was a shocker! I See You by Clare Mackintosh was also a stunner
3373,hvacaa,11,I did NOT like the resolution of Orient Express
3374,hvacaa,41,"Ender’s game, the whole book is good and last chapter is like ... whaaast ???"
3375,hvacaa,8,"I actually do remember that from childhood! The part about going through and looking at the title page, and chapters. We did not look at the last page, but we did the rest. That was actually a really pleasant memory to have brought up. 😊 Being read to in Kindergarten and lower grades was THE BEST"
3376,hvacaa,3,"Six of Crows by Leigh Bargadough (spelled that wrong), Children of Blood and Bone by Toni Adeyemi, and Crown of Feathers my Niki Pau Preto"
3377,hvacaa,7,"The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks was pretty twisty, and twisted."
3378,hvacaa,17,"I still remember this decades later!  My stomach just dropped, it was like a horrible sucker punch."
3379,hvacaa,3,"I thought it was pretty neat, dunno if it was intended to be or I'm just stupid but I had no idea who dunnit till the very end"
3380,hvacaa,12,"The book is set in a small village called Kings Abbot. Roger Ackroyd was a man everyone living there knew and loved, however one day, his expression, mood, everything changed. He tells his friend Dr Sheppard about a letter he received which he is too scared to open. (This is not a spoiler btw). A couple hours later, Ackroyd is found murdered in his study. Numerous other people were in same the house at the time, and any one of them could have killed him. Detective Hercule Poirot promises to solve the case with the aid of Dr Sheppard. This book has probably the biggest plot twist of any book I’ve read."
3381,hvacaa,3,"Controversial opinion time

#SPOILERS

Trust Exercise wasn’t clever and it was abysmally written. Why it was nominated for the National Book Award, I do not understand. Thought describing teens having sex in great detail was squicky, and then she hit us with the teen girl enjoying a middle-aged man forcing himself on her. I don’t care what the book says about memory, that’s disgusting."
3382,hvacaa,11,But not Truly Madly Guilty. That book was shit.
3383,hvacaa,6,"Okay, I have three right off the bat. Then I might possibly add an edit after I go back and look through a few other books I think I remember might meet the plot twist category.

I'm going to count back from my top favorite three twisty plot books (and keep in mind I've read *thousands* of books lol.)

3. Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan.
This is one of my absolute favorite books I've ever read. The only reason I put it at 3 instead of 2 is because it might not be some people's cup of tea. In fact, at first, I didn't think it would be mine. It's more than a little odd. But if you just give it a chance, it's full to the brim of twists and turns and secrets and mysteries. And by the end, all you want is there to be some secret place, somewhere, you can keep reading. I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a day and a half.

2 The Orphan Master's Son by Adam Johnson. This is another book that is also extremely good. It won the Pulitzers Prize in 2012. (Referencing the back cover) Pak Jun Do, the ""haunted son of a lost mother - a singer 'stolen' to Pyongyang - and an influential father who runs a work camp for orphans."" He is raised as an orphan on that camp in. Superiors in the North Korean state soon begin to notice Jun Do for his loyalty and keen instincts, and he soon begins to rise up the ranks, doing things he thought were unfathomable just to stay alive and continue climbing the ranks.
However, although this book contains some alternative history/reality (as becomes more obvious in later chapters) The author did a massive amount of research on the DPRK and its defectors. The very first person he interviewed for his book was had been an orphan from the North. He writes about things that do actually happen there (like the mylar balloons: read about that in the Reader's Guide; A Conversation Between Adam Johnson and David Ebershoff. It's amazing.) The author even traveled to Pyongyang, something very few people get to do. But he had minders the whole time. But when he asked questions about why things found in every major city you would travel to were nowhere to be found (there were no disabled people in the capital, no fire stations, and where the mail was delivered since there were no mailboxes?) He was met with a lot of suspicion. Finally, observing that all the women in Pyongyang were the same shade of lipstick was ""the last straw"" for him on this orchestrated tour. He also says that some of the truly shocking and scary things he took note of in Pyongyang that he put straight into the book were things like ""a dump truck filled with ""volunteers"" headed toward the countryside, a family scrambling to steal chestnuts from a public park, shock-work whistles, chrome Kalashnikovs, and a night watchman sitting up all night to guard carp in the fishponds."" It's also illegal for a citizen of the DPRK to interact with a foreigner. Further than the things he learned and saw first hand, the book is fiction though.

And finally,

1.A God in Ruins by Kate Atkinson.
This. Book. Blew. My. Fucking. Mind.
It made me actually start to question the parallels of time and life. A God in Ruins is actually a sequel to her book, Life After Life, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything by reading this first. I start reading this, and start getting into it, really enjoying it, thinking, ""This is a really good book."" Then... I've never had a book have the kind of effect on me that this one did. I don't want to say too much because it the unexpectedness that is the best part."
3384,hvacaa,3,"Kate Morton's books are great for plot twists, but the Distant Hours especially blew me away."
3385,hvacaa,12,Eleanor oliphant is completely fine
3386,hvacaa,7,"Dark Places by Gillian Flynn; I found it a lot more shocking and suspenseful that Gone Girl

Also Shari Lapena’s The Couple Next Door has a new shocking twist every chapter and an ending you’ll never see coming!!!!!"
3387,hvacaa,3,Came here to recommend The Queen's Thief Series. Beautiful worldbuilding and court intrigue/politics.
3388,hvacaa,33,"Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier.  More twists than a bag of snakes."
3389,hvacaa,3,YES!! I was just about to comment this. I was absolutely flabbergasted.
3390,hvacaa,4,Green eggs and ham by dr Seuss
3391,hvacaa,3,"{{The Queen of the Tearling}} it’s a trilogy that’s extremely well planned throughout all 3 books and the world building is slowly executed across all 3 books. I read them as they were published so I have to go back and read them in order again sequentially with no other books (or years) in between but I loved the authors setup and execution of the final plot line!

ETA: author is Erika Johansen and apparently she released a novella that is pre QotT and then there will be a Book 4 coming out in February 2021!!! THANK YOU OPPPPPPPPPP!!!!! You’re awesome and just reintroduced me to a series I loved and now I know there will be moreeeeee!!!!"
3392,hvacaa,12,Me too! I thought I was the only one who disliked this book.  There were no likable characters.  I want to have at least one person to root for.
3393,hvacaa,3,"“The Devotion of Suspect X”  by Keigo Higashino. I got this recommendation from an interview with Goosebumps author RL Stine. He said he loves puzzle books with crazy twist endings, and this definitely fits!"
3394,hvacaa,7,the girl with all the gifts was a pretty big mind f
3395,hvacaa,5,"This was the biggest hit of my book club, and the first time we’d read anything that could remotely be considered a classic. I love the writing and the development of the narrator character, too!"
3396,hvacaa,5,Also cross her heart! Love her books
3397,hvacaa,3,Change of Heart by Picoult is one of the most brilliant books I have read. And Handle With Care breaks my heart every time I think of it.
3398,hvacaa,5,"i second jodi picoult and honestly i read the post and i wanted to put house rules by her but didn't know if it was a big enough plot twist. that book by her is my all time hands down favorite out of all the books ive read by her so far (i own almost all but some ive started and not finished some i haven't read and one is too triggering for me atm to read). I think i like that book so much because i was diagnosed with aspergers before the dsm v was a thing and i have a special interest in true crime/forensics and that book combined my special interest with something very personal and relatable to me, and i loved the twist ending so much because of the fact it disproves an autism sterotype, which i won't get into because i don't want to spoil too much if you're curious and don't mind spoilers (like i am) you can dm me and ill tell you"
3399,hvacaa,5,"I feel like maybe it was too hyped. I thought it was average, but everyone and their mothers was like “OHMYGOD GONE GIRL IS AMAZING!!!1!!!” so maybe that’s the issue. I’m glad there is people who enjoy it, it just really didn’t fit with my tastes lol."
3400,hvacaa,4,"Dark Matter by Blake Crouch, Wayward Pines trilogy by Blake Crouch, The Messenger by Markus Zusak, The 7 and Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Truton, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie, and Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie.

Also, the short story The Egg by Andy Weir."
3401,hvacaa,3,"Ah shoot, Murder on the Orient is my only Christie so far. I kind of guessed the twist too for some reason."
3402,hvacaa,6,The Life of Pi by Yann Martel. When I finished the book I sat for ages and thought about the ending. It has stayed with me.
3403,hvacaa,13,"Ender's Game absolutely blew my mind twice: once re: zero-gravity fighting, and once at the end of the book. I've been searching for books that give me the same feeling ever since."
3404,hvacaa,3,I threw that book across the room when I read the ending (party scene).
3405,hvacaa,5,LOVED House rules. I was thinking the same re plot twist but it's a fantastic book. And very informative too. What I love about her is how much research she puts in to her books. Fabulous writer.
3406,hvacaa,4,The woman in cabin 10 was a great murder mystery with an unexpected twist. Definitely recommend.
3407,hvacaa,4,One of my favorite books of all time is a Picoult book called “The Pact”. It’s amazing. One of the only books I’ve read more than once.
3408,hvacaa,3,"Wait until you get further in the series, there is a lot more throwing of the books."
3409,hvacaa,3,Not only did I not like it but I totally guessed the ending
3410,hvacaa,10,Yeah I was kind of bored in the movie because I'd read the book. The book was jawdropping with twists and makes me feel inadequate as a writer even though I mostly think I'm really creative. That was so many twists I felt it was beyond my abilities. 😞
3411,hvacaa,3,I just finished The Woman In The Window. I did not see any of those twists coming. Gripping.
3412,hvacaa,16,Her other two books are way darker and equally twisty. Sharp Objects was made into a decent HBO.limited series (TW self harm) Dark places was also made into a movie but I didn't watch because I didn't need any more if those images in my head.
3413,hvacaa,6,it haunts me terribly.
3414,hvacaa,3,Dark Places is so good! You don’t see that coming. Also Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn I think it has a good plot twist.
3415,hvacaa,6,Changed it more than once!
3416,hvacaa,7,Basically most Agatha Christie books. Would also recommend the Mystery of the Blue Train and the ABC Murders
3417,hvacaa,3,"Yes! I understand why it's required reading, but our ending assignment was for everybody to write at least a paragraph about the ending. Our teacher wanted to know how we thought/felt about the ending. I was the only person in the class to write what I wrote. 

I absolutely love The Giver. It's a book I recommend to everybody. Definitely a top 10 for me. And it will mess you up."
3418,hvacaa,3,"Watched the movie and really love it, like really enjoy it. 

I have a thing about not being able to read books if it was too similar to the movie (e.g. Silence of the Lambs was almost page for page the movie). Is the book ruined for me? I keep debating if I should pick it up or not."
3419,hvacaa,4,Never did understand the hype surrounding the book. Same with movie too. I have read much better books. Good to know there are plenty like me
3420,hvacaa,4,And Then There Were None is one of my all time favorite books because it’s just such an interesting ride from start to finish. But Roger Ackroyd and Curtain are both really great at making you think it couldn’t possibly be the person you think it is.
3421,hvacaa,3,Because of your reply I’m going to try it again as I am very much into this genre but had a hard time getting into the story.
3422,hvacaa,3,"Sorry, I guess I didn't explain it. You don't read the last page. It's also not taught as, ""This is how you read, and you have to do it this way."" It's literally the very early stages of reading and showing how a book is held, how the pages flip, and that we read left to right. It's just modeling different text features for young kids during read alouds really. You can LOOK at the last page to get a sense of how long the book is, is there a picture, is there an About the Author, etc. A lot of readers just naturally glance at the last few words eventually and keep up that habit."
3423,hvacaa,3,The ending of book 2 is madness!!
3424,hvacaa,4,I do this! Even if I’m at the movie theater.. And then I silently hate myself for the duration of the movie 😅 I read somewhere that this could be a by-product of anxiety (which I have) and it can be seen as an attempt to have some control over the anxiety of not knowing what will happen 🤷🏻‍♀️
3425,hvacaa,3,"There's a virtual reality game called Echo arena, that's pretty much the same thing. Its incredible."
3426,hvc65s,26,"If you want something relevant to the US falling apart in the face of a highly contagious pandemic, I highly suggest Station Eleven."
3427,hvc65s,5,"You might like A Song For a New Day by Sarah Pinsker. It was published (a decade ago) last year, and it deals with a future where disease and violence have lead to a society where social distancing is the norm and mass gatherings aren't really a thing anymore."
3428,hvc65s,12,The Road by Cormac McCarthy.
3429,hvc65s,5,"Neuromancer by William Gibson.

The character Molly Millions in it is pretty amazing."
3430,hvc65s,3,The end part of The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell was utterly depressing to me as it felt very very possible. The rest of the book isn’t like that so the contrast made it even worse. It’s a great book.
3431,hvc65s,5,The Giver
3432,hvc65s,16,Oryx and Crake by Margaret Attwood.
3433,hvc65s,6,Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
3434,hvc65s,8,Yes - this series wins my personal award for most likely dystopian future.
3435,hvc65s,6,"The Windup Girl by Paola Bacigalupi is fantastic dystopic far-future sci-fi. Set in the Kingdom of Bangkok, below a massive sea-wall, featuring the political/intellectual property struggles of the ""calorie companies"" running the world. One of the most compelling and simultaneously unlikeable casts of characters in any book ever."
3436,hvc65s,7,"The Water Knife by Baccigalupi 

Parable of the Sower by Butler"
3437,hvc65s,3,“Feed” by Matthew Tobin Anderson. High tech world where you’re advertised to all the time in your head based on the things you buy and your whole value in society is based on your spending. Oh and also the environment is destroyed. So basically take every problem we have now and make it even more extreme.
3438,hvc65s,6,The Stand - Stephen King
3439,hvc65s,7,"Parable of the Talents, Sower's sequel, even features a right wing demagogue who verbatim promises to make America great again. Published in 1998"
3440,hvc65s,4,The Girl with all the Gifts
3441,hvc65s,3,"World war Z. I hear the audio book is better, but i loved the actual book too. Never read anything like it."
3442,hvc65s,6,"Eos Dawn series, Gen Guberman

Maze Runner

Hunger Games

The 100"
3443,hvc65s,3,"Dune, 1984. Not so much of a futurist thing but The Institute by Stephen King is quite a dark, grey story about child abductions for the sake of science so there’s that?"
3444,hvc65s,3,The Postman - David Brin.
3445,hvc65s,3,I’m currently reading “Parable of the Sower” and it is shockingly relevant to our current times/near future. It’s hard to believe it was written almost 30 years ago.
3446,hvc65s,3,"
I suggested it because OP said “most likely” to be our future, and I think brave new world most closely resembles where capitalism is headed. 

But I’m not sure why you think a forced caste system, subliminal indoctrination, forcing sexuality onto children so they won’t feel love when they’re adults, and the encouragement of drugs to keep people happily complicit isn’t very bad."
3447,hvc65s,4,"Not sure what to tell you.

When I read the book (some fifteen years ago), my sense was ""this isn't too much worse than our present reality."""
3448,hvc65s,3,This is a short story but it seems pretty relevant. Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut.
3449,hvc65s,3,Anything by Chuck Palahniuk. I’m in the middle of reading “Rant” again and I highly suggest it!
3450,hvc65s,4,It’s so good..my favourite novel of all time!
3451,hvc65s,3,The parasite trilogy by Myra Grant. New drug invented that makes people immune to any virus and can eat whatever. Shit hits the fan when something starts taking over. I'm trying not to spoil it but they were really good books set in future San Francisco.
3452,hvc65s,3,"Grab Year of the Flood as well

(Maddadam - good, but nowhere near the other two)"
3453,hvc65s,3,"Earth Abides, The Stand, The Passage Trilogy, Swan Song"
3454,hvc65s,3,Station 11 by Emily St. John Mandel. The Road by Cormac McCarthy too.
3455,hvc65s,3,Yeah I actually could not get into American Psycho!! I might try again sometime but it really was a struggle for me.
3456,hvc65s,3,It's probably all the listing. Like when he goes into elaborate detail about what everyone's wearing from where and the excessive monologues about music are pretty dull to read but they're meant to add to his character. I skim read them anyway cause it was so damn boring. But the rest was good.

Also Jane Austen, of course. And remember that she’s being funny. Start with Pride and Prejudice ."
3461,hvcyzz,3,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance sounds really interesting. I’ll be sure to check out the other ones.l too!

3463,hvcyzz,3,"A few classics that I thoroughly enjoyed are: 

Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë (the Brontë sisters are all extremely talented but I just liked Jane as a heroine)

The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde (it's witty and hilarious!)

In Cold Blood by Truman Capote (it's coldly chilling but interesting nonetheless)

Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier (again, creepy and tense but irresistible and it had an unprecedented ending)

Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen (if you read Pride and Prejudice, this one is almost as good- a romance novel mixed with gothic elements that Austen criticises in a humorous, light hearted way!)"
3464,hvcyzz,4,A Christmas Carol by Dickens is probably grossly overlooked for serious reading because it’s so well-known and commercialized to death...but it is a true classic - well written and thoughtful.
3465,hvcyzz,5,"“Middlemarch” by George Eliot (aka Mary Ann Evans)

“Bleak House” by Charles Dickens. IMO, Dickens finest novel."
3466,hvcyzz,5,I have read Half of a Yellow Sun and I also recommend Americanah by Chimananda Ngozi Adichie.

3469,hvgsbx,14,"Yes, so philosophy isn’t like other subjects where you can just dive in at your point of interest. Philosophy is essentially a conversation, and every philosopher is responding to the ideas and conversations had by everyone that came before them, so you really need to build your knowledge-base from the ground up

Sure, you could technically read Kant on Day 1, but you’re really not going to get much out of it, since the language and ideas he’s employing/addressing have been in development since Plato. This is true for most academic philosophy

Pop-philosophers and lifestyle philosophy are different (e.g. Camus and Aurelius). You don’t need to know about Cartesian skepticism to grasp The Stranger or Meditations. I personally think Camus is overrated in terms of the caliber of his ideas, so if you’re not getting that much out of his texts, you might just not find his perspective compelling

Marcus Aurelius is different. It’s not a book that’s meant to be powered through. It was the personal diary of the most powerful man in the world, his own thoughts on living a virtuous life — never meant to be published. Read it, reread it, pick out random sections, and *meditate* on the ideas he’s putting forth. Try putting some of them into practice, but don’t expect him to spell out any answers for you

I’ve never read Nietzsche so I can’t comment on his writing, but I believe he falls more into the academic category

So, with that said, rather than reading 10 philosophical texts to finally get to one that interests you, I would recommend doing research on the field of thought the text pertains to — what type of philosophy is it, who are the key players, main arguments and criticism to those arguments etc. There’s also a series by Oxford called “A Very Short Introduction” which is a fantastic resource for philosophical introductions"
3470,hvgsbx,3,"Brave New World is definitely one of my faves, and I enjoyed Fight Club a lot.  Right now i'm reading The Myth of Sisyphus and am writing notes in the margins

thanks for all the advice."

3528,hvq423,7,Tales of the Ketty Jay series by Chris Wooding  (#1: Retribution Falls)

3530,hvq423,47,Show: schitts creek
3531,hvq423,12,*The House of God* by Samuel Shem. It's one of many influences on the show.
3532,hvq423,6,"Thankyou. Didn’t know there was a book version, definitely going to read it."
3533,hvq423,6,A bit more serious but North and South might appeal to you? It’s a book but the series adaptation is fantastic.
3534,hvq423,12,"Characters:

*Bridget Jones's Diary*; it's effectively a retelling of *Pride and Prejudice*.

Banter:

I'd check out some noir detective novels by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. A lot of fun.

Films:

*Clueless* as a (once) modernised version of *Emma*. It's lovely.

I'll also throw *It Happened One Night* in there."
3535,hvq423,5,"*Mad Men* was enormously influenced by *Something Happened* by Joseph Heller. It's an incredible novel, but definitely not the most commercial thing you'll ever find. It still blew me away. The ending will stay with you for years."
3536,hvq423,3,basically anything by Jane Austen. Northanger Abbey i found a bit boring but it does have interesting conversations

3703,hvq423,6,Seanan McGuire's InCryptid series. It's about a family of hunters that broke from the secret society that the family belonged to because of the society's genocidal reaction to monsters. Now they live in the US and only hunt those monsters that are causing danger to the human and/or Cryptid Community.

3710,hvq423,4,Ever tried John Grisham?
3711,hvq423,16,"(And Terry Pratchett, Good Omens was co-authored!) 
Gaiman in general would likely be a good match, tho. Neverwhere, Coraline, I can think of a lot of his books that match the feel of Ghibli movies and have some of the humor and humanity of the Good Place."

3717,hvq423,6,Maybe Noir (by Christopher Moore)? Similar detective-y vibe

3729,hvq423,3,"Dark matter is sensational but in a good way. Sure, it’s not the most grounded thriller, but it’s an excellent jumping off point for someone who’s trying to get back into reading. I have a couple of buddies who aren’t strong readers, and I recommended Dark Matter to them. They loved it!

The writing style isn’t as nuanced as some other sci-fis, but it definitely has its merits. The straightforward style is way less intimidating for a weaker reader."

3744,hvq423,6,"The story sounds interesting, but I saw it filed as YA. That's not a deal breaker if it is well written, but at 30 years of age not my go-to genre. I guess I'll still give it a try, though. Thanks."

3749,hvq423,6,"Probably not quite what you're looking for but figured I'd toss it out there: Something by Tucker Max maybe? Not really a band of characters, but that same sort of shithousery they get into in IASIP.

Here's from the introduction of one of his books: ""My name is Tucker Max, and I am an asshole. I get excessively drunk at inappropriate times, disregard social norms, indulge every whim, ignore the consequences of my actions, mock idiots and posers, sleep with more women than is safe or reasonable, and just generally act like a raging dickhead. But, I do contribute to humanity in one very important way: I share my adventures with the world."""

3753,hvq423,5,"As far as adventure then Mistborn is the way to go. Broken Earth is a character(s) study in a fantastic and brutal world. Broken Earth is more adult in that is less adventure and the events are not really the focus. The focus is on how these women interact with the world and how that world treats them.

If you mean world building by ""cultural design"" then they are probably equal. Sanderson is known a ""hard"" magic system and approaches it from more of a scientific method. As I recall Broken Earth was more of a soft approach. If you mean something which is more focused on black culture by ""cultural design"" then Broken Earth is the obvious one since the parallels between the United States history of slavery/racism and that of the Broken Earth are very clear. 

In short: if you want something which is high adventure, romance and a scientific approach to a magic system then Mistborn is your bag. If you want a character(s) study in a fantastic and brutal world with parallels to American Slavery, Jim Crow, and modern American racism then Broken Earth is the direction you want to go. 

You really should read both. Mistborn for escapism, Broken Earth to remember how horrific and terrible humanity is."

A boy finds a dragon egg and forms a bond with the dragon. It has dwarves and elves and magic and dragons and sword fighting and epic battles but also the characters are cool and well developed.

3788,hvq423,4,"If you like *Lost* then *The Stand* by Stephen King is a good one. It's about a pandemic that wipes out most of the population of Earth and then spooky/magical forces trying to take advantage of the situation. It has an almost uncanny amount of similarities, which is not entirely accidental as the creators of *Lost* confirmed they got some inspiration from *The Stand*. Each is based around a large cast of survivors (which in both stories include many similar character types such as a semi-famous rock star, a criminal, a person who has spent time in a mental asylum, a child who seemingly has some kind of psychic powers, human personifications of good and evil, and others), trying to make do with being separated from civilisation and also the supernatural forces they are suddenly up against.

3793,hvq423,5,The Catcher in the Rye reminds me of Ladybird
3794,hvq423,4,"This is a pretty accurate assessment. I would also add as a warning that Broken Earth can be hard-hitting, especially because it parallels so much real-world inequality, that I know it can be a very emotionally intense experience. That's part of why I love it, but I definitely need to be in the right head space for it. Mistborn, on the other hand, can be considered YA. It has some tear-jerking moments, but for the most part it's relatively quite light and does feel fun to read. 

One option might be to read one Mistborn book between each Broken Earth book as a palate cleanser."
3795,hvq423,3,You will definitely love the series then.
3796,hvq423,8,Me too because i'd love book recommendations which were similar
3797,hvq423,11,I feel like this is what makes the book for me. You love to hate them
3798,hvq423,3,"Well that'd be my first recommendation. After that it depends what you liked. For the alternate perspective Animal Farm, Watership Down, or The Plague Dogs. For family stories Water for Elephants, The Memory Keeper's Daughter."
3799,hvq423,5,"I have read the first 22 I think. I have enjoyed them all. For me reading them is similar to slipping on a pair of well worn leather slippers that comfort your feet in the most comforting way. I feel the same way about ""Brooklyn 99."" The humor for me is quite comforting. 

I hope this helps.

For the record the movie based on the first book did not have the same feeling. I felt Debbie Reynolds was one of the few good things in the movie."

3807,hvq423,3,"Broken Earth I have only read the first but it does not have any of the lighthearted approach of ATLA. They both deal inner turmoil, intriguing character development, and save the world vibes- but Broken Earth is a dystopian series that deals a lot with racism &amp; classism and was written for adults. It's really good, but heavy content.

I haven't read Mistborn, but wanted to share my perspective as a big fan of ATLA who has also read The Fifth Season.

I've got several more, including several series and some standalones that probably belong on this list too, but those are my no-doubters."
3862,hvv53r,3,Thanks I’m pretty bizarre myself lol
3863,hvv53r,3,Amazing list!! I had the same experience when I switched to Audible as well. We even have some similarities in our reread pal (LOOOVE the Bobiverse Trilogy).
3864,hvv53r,7,"The little Prince 

And

Animal Farm"
3865,hvv53r,3,"The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith

The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis

Apparently I like books from the 50s with Christmas and roadtrips???"
3866,hvv53r,3,The Perks of Being a Wallflower is definitely my most read book.
3867,hvv53r,6,I always end up rereading enders game every few years.
3868,hvv53r,3,Aristotle and Dante Discover the secrets of the universe - I read it every summer!
3869,hvv53r,5,Pride and prejudice is one of my favorites novels ever.
3870,hvx81s,56,"If you like hauntings: The Shining

If you like epics: The Dark Tower Series

If you like thrillers: Duma Key

If you like apocalypse: The Stand

If you like quick reads: The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon

If you want to read a book and watch a  good movie version: It, Misery, The Dead Zone. 


Enjoy!"
3871,hvx81s,9,"A lot of people will probably suggest something like The Stand or The Shining. And those are good books, but they’re a little thick in the page count. I’d recommend something like Carrie or Misery, for starters. Maybe the Girl who loved Tom Gordon, I’d you’re looking for something a little more current.

Edit: to correct a a books title."
3872,hvx81s,11,"I am one of the very few that don't care for most of his work.  That being said, I do have a few of his that I truly loved.

Rose Madder

Misery

Thinner"
3873,hvx81s,25,Just pick up *Carrie* and start reading.
3874,hvx81s,15,"I's start with his short stories to get a feeling of his range  
\- Different Seasons   
\- The Bazaar of Bad Dreams"
3875,hvx81s,10,I didn't know there's a tv version of The Dead Zone!
3876,hvx81s,13,"Salem’s Lot

Or the Dark Tower Series."
3877,hvx81s,5,"To start reading King’s books, I recommend these:
- Misery
- Carrie
- The Mist
- Joyland
- From a Buick 8
- Night Shift (short stories)
- Nightmares and Dreamscapes (short stories)

It’s better if you go reading from the first novel and, when you read a couple more, start the Dark Tower series, you’ll love the references... hell, you can even find references between his standalone novels, such as locations or characters, it’s a vast universe to explore."
3878,hvx81s,8,"I always suggest starting with his first book, Carrie, and working your way through his bibliography chronologically."
3879,hvx81s,36,"This is a minority opinion, but I'll throw it out there anyway: *Pet Sematary* is my favorite King novel by far. I find it sad, haunting and yet really scary. Nothing I've read of him has come close."
3880,hvx81s,4,Carrie or Misery is a good starting place.
3881,hvx81s,8,Christopher Walken FTW
3882,hvx81s,7,Go all in and start with The Stand!! Especially right now that this pandemic is going on!
3883,hvx81s,4,GERALD'S GAME really messed me up when I was a kid. To this day (I'm 35) I still think about it.
3884,hvx81s,10,It was an ok show. But that movie is terrific.
3885,hvx81s,3,"'salem's lot, the stand, the shining, it, the tommyknockers and needful things are my favorite king novels and are well worth the read."
3886,hvx81s,7,I agree. This was definitely his scariest book! My husband (huge Stephen King fan) and I read this together and he was thoroughly spooked!
3887,hvx81s,4,"I would suggest not to start with the Dark Tower series and start with his other works first. The Shining, It, Salem’s lot would be my choices for horror."
3888,hvx81s,26,11/22/63 is by far my favourite of his books. A man goes back in time to stop the assassination of JFK.
3889,hvx81s,4,"Carrie, always"
3890,hvx81s,5,Salem’s Lot or the Shining.
3891,hvx81s,3,"The Dark Tower series is my favorite epic series out there, but you’ll get more out of it if you’ve read some of his other books first as it ties his Universe together"
3892,hvx81s,3,"Im not a fan of most of his work, ive tried a lot but there’s just something about his writing. However I enjoyed these two 

The girl who loved Tom Gordon 

Carrie"
3893,hvx81s,3,The Body and Salem’s Lot.  But there is something to like in all of his books.  There is no one who develops characters like he can. That’s why it doesn’t matter what he writes because you are always taken in by his characters.  He is the master.
3894,hvx81s,3,"The Gunslinger, godammit."
3895,hvx81s,5,The Stand
3896,hvx81s,8,I started with The Long Walk and loved it
3897,hvx81s,6,Salem's Lot!
3898,hvx81s,3,I agree as well. I’ve read a lot of King’s book and Pet Sematary is one of my favourites. I’d also like to suggest The Green Mile and The Long Walk (written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman).
3899,hvx81s,4,Pet Sematary. Such a scary novel. It’s such a well written book by him and I think is easily up there with Carrie. I don’t know what the general opinion is on this book but if you’re looking for a great scare this is it!
3900,hvx81s,4,I read skeleton crew aged about 10. I still have nightmares about that fucking raft.
3901,hvx81s,4,"Question for you. If it wasn’t written by king, what genre would you place that book in? I have pondered this and I cannot decide. Good book though. The only book that ever got a tune stuck in my head..."
3902,hvx81s,3,Beautiful book. Nothing happens and it’s gripping.
3903,hvx81s,3,But THE STAND is his most epic.  It's most people's favorite so if I were the OP I would save it for last.  I say start with the excellent CHRISTINE or NEEDFUL THINGS.
3904,hvx81s,4,Came here to say this
3905,hvx81s,3,I can’t get thru the gunslinger
3906,hvx81s,3,Seconded.
3907,hvx81s,3,The shining seems like a good to start
3908,hvx81s,4,"It’s slower than the rest, for sure - don’t expect the structure of The Gunslinger throughout the rest of the series. It becomes a much more digestible style as the books go on. While it’s my personal favorite, i understand how tough it can be to get through. I’d say power through as best you can so that you can read the rest - if it helps, find an audiobook version."
3909,hw08fo,3,"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut? 

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S Thompson?"
3910,hw08fo,3,"Bill, the galactic hero."
3911,hw08fo,3,Anything by Tom Sharpe
3912,hw08fo,5,Robert Rankin books. Brentford trilogy is hilarious.
3913,hw08fo,10,"Anything by Jasper Fforde - try The Eyre Affair or The Big Over Easy first

The Tent, The Bucket and Me by Emma Kennedy

PG Wodehouse"
3914,hw08fo,3,"On the ridiculous, British side, you have Keith Laumer with his Retief of the CDT series

On the American side, John Scalzi injects humor into most of his books, and Andy Wier is pretty amusing in *The Martian*"
3915,hw08fo,22,Anything by Christopher Moore.
3916,hw08fo,4,I second Jasper Fforde. He’s right up there with Pratchett and Adams imo.
3917,hw08fo,3,The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse
3918,hw08fo,4,Just about all of Tom Holt’s books
3919,hw08fo,4,"*This Body's Not Big Enough for Both of Us* by Edgar Cantero. The first line of the book got a chuckle out of me and it only got better.

 **Elmore Leonard said it’s bad style to open a novel with the weather. Well, fuck him - it was a blazing red-hot August morning.**"
3920,hw08fo,6,"John and Dave trilogy by David Wong
(John Dies at the End)
Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris.
Both are really good. David Wong is pretty absurdist humor and Joshua Ferris' book is more down to Earth. There's a lot more to it with humor sprinkled throughout, imagine The Office but more serious."
3921,hw08fo,3,‘Happiness’ by Will Ferguson and ‘The Hike’ by Drew Magary both made me laugh out loud
3922,hw08fo,4,When I first read Wodehouse I was a bit annoyed I hadn't done it earlier
3923,hw08fo,6,"If you like nonfiction, I highly recommend Mary Roach! Her books Stiff, Bonk, and Spook are all pop-science and incredibly clever"
3924,hw08fo,9,*A Confederacy of Dunces; The Princess Bride;* Magnus Mills and Patrick deWitt are worth checking out
3925,hw08fo,4,"Came here to suggest Jasper Fforde. He’s so great. 

The Rook by Dan O’Malley is good for a bit of a chuckle as well."
3926,hw08fo,3,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Bobiverse books based on another humorous recommendation, but I didn’t find them to be very funny. They had some moments, but they seemed to be more philosophical than anything"
3927,hw08fo,4,"For some reason, all I can think of are Floridian writers right now haha

Tim Dorsey and Carl Hiaasen both write really funny Florida-themed fiction, and Dave Barry is/(was?) a humor columnist that I really enjoy. Also from Florida."
3928,hw08fo,3,"The Florida humor books of Tim Dorsey and Carl Hiaasen

Lamb, Dirty Job, etc, by Christopher Moore"
3929,hw08fo,12,"David Sedaris generally makes me laugh.  *Me Talk Pretty One Day* is a very funny memoir, but everything I’ve read of his is pretty good."
3930,hw08fo,3,PG Wodehouse and Bill Bryson are my two favorite humorous authors.
3931,hw08fo,4,We had our officiant (my brother in law) hold a bible-looking copy of Lamb on the podium at our wedding
3932,hw08fo,3,"I wish I'd thought to take my copy of Lamb to the Christopher Moore book signings I've been to. Coulda had a signed first edition...

I do have a signed first edition and ARC of Fool, though."
3933,hw7qgk,12,Sunshine by Robin McKinley. A standalone.
3934,hw7qgk,12,"Chicagoland Vampires series by Chloe Neill

Vampire Academy series and the Bloodlines series both by Richelle Mead

Some of the Mercy Thompson books by Patricia Briggs feature vampires 

Same goes for the Kate Daniels series by Ilona Andrews

The Parasol Protectorate series by Gail Carriger"
3935,hw7qgk,4,The Passage Series is great
3936,hw7qgk,7,"If you're into horror, Let the Right One In by John Lindqvist is a wonderful (albeit disturbing) read. Definitely not your conventional vampire story."
3937,hw7qgk,5,I just read The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix - it was creepy and smart and funny. Highly recommend.
3938,hw7qgk,3,Was going to post this.
3939,hw7qgk,9,The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova. It has everything. Vlad the Impaler. Incredible settings. Historic mysteries. A female protagonist with a gun. It’s an absorbing book that could’ve easily been trashy and one of my all time favourites.
3940,hw7qgk,13,Interview With A Vampire by Ann Rice. It’s a first in a series. I haven’t read these personally but they are on my list! Supposed to be really good. Good luck on your book search!
3941,hw7qgk,10,"Bram Stoker's Dracula

-and- Stephen King's modern version, Salem's Lot

Sunshine (Robin McKinley)

Interview With the Vampire (Anne Rice)

Dark Dance (Tanith Lee) - first book in her Blood Opera Sequence

Fevre Dream (George R.R. Martin)

Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite

The Lesser Dead (Christopher Buehlman)

NOS4A2 (Joe Hill)

Some Of Your Blood (Theodore Sturgeon)

The Beautiful (Renee Ahdieh)

The Coldest Girl in Coldtown (Holly Black)"
3942,hw7qgk,6,If you like comedy Christopher Moore's book Bloodsucking Fiends is a funny modern take on the vampire story.
3943,hw7qgk,4,Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles!!! Started reading them when I was a kid and have reread them a couple of times. Here is a [list in chronological order](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampire_Chronicles) for you.
3944,hw7qgk,3,Fevre Dream by George R.R. Martin. It’s about vampires on riverboats in Louisiana. Wild book.
3945,hw7qgk,3,I’ve read all of these except Parasol Protectorate and wholeheartedly agree. Just wanted to add Queen of Kings by Maria Dahvana Headley and House of Night series by P.C. Cast (genuinely one of my favorites)
3946,hw7qgk,3,The Southern Vampire series by Charlaine Harris. They were the basis for the TV show True Blood.
3947,hw8fro,4,Maybe *Dhalgren* by Samuel R. Delany.
3948,hw8fro,8,Anything by Brandon Sanderson. It's not dense but it meets your other requirements
3949,hw8fro,8,"I love where your head is at &lt;3 I wish I could suggest better, but I'm impatient with bad books. I guess *Les Misérables* had this effect on me, but the parts with actual plot are kind of enjoyable. *The Jungle* by Upton Sinclair is one of the worst books I've ever read. I know it's not a popular opinion, but I found *Milkman* by Anna Burns utterly tedious, extremely repetitive, terse, unimaginative -- this is the only book I've ever started skimming through the page just to get it over with faster."
3950,hw8fro,3,"Ducks, Newburyport.

Why???"
3951,hw8fro,3,"*Little, Big* by John Crowley. The prose is beautiful, but that gets old fast and the plot (at least for the first 20% of the book, which is as far as I’ve gotten) is agonizingly slow."
3952,hw8fro,4,Madame Bovary. This book could make you decide that sex is boring.
3953,hw8fro,9,The Bible.
3954,hw8fro,5,The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. I’ll even send you my copy if I haven’t already discarded it. Holy cow. I didn’t make it very far. The man is more proud of his prose than of the story.
3955,hw8fro,3,Yes! Such a disappointment after reading *Of Mice and Men*
3956,hw8fro,7,I love the grapes of wrath.
3957,hw8fro,3,Boring is subjective but Musil’s Man Without Qualities has this density of detail that can overwhelm...
3958,hw8fro,3,"I’d say Ulysses is difficult but not at all dry. Try some Thomas Mann. Buddenbrooks, for example, or The Magic Mountain. Gloomy, long and tedious."
3959,hw8fro,5,"*The Great Gatsby*, hated it when I read it in high school so I picked it back up a few years back.  High school me was right, it's a boring piece of shit with terrible characters."
3960,hw8fro,3,Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell
3961,hw8fro,5,Heart of Darkness.
3962,hw8fro,3,Gadsby - it’s a stunt novel written entirely without the letter E. It’s terrible.
3963,hw8fro,3,I am so glad someone else thought Milkman was tedious. I felt her point could have been proved in quarter of the final length.
3964,hwgtat,17,"I haven’t personally read it, but I would highly recommend Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations. It’s a collection of notes written by Roman Emperor and stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius"
3965,hwgtat,13,I would recommend anything written by Herman Hesse or Friedrich Nietszche
3966,hwgtat,39,Anything by Albert Camus
3967,hwgtat,23,"In my experience, reading philosophy is almost an ""all roads lead to Rome"" kind of thing, so although some places are easier to start in, finding what you prefer and branching out after a while is the most enjoyable thing. 

Here's a small list: 

5 dialogues- Plato

Sickness Until Death-  Søren  Kierkegaard

Either/Or- Søren Kierkegaard

The Idiot, The Brothers Karamozov, Notes From the Underground, and really anything else that Dostoyevsky wrote. 

Book of the Chuang Tzu- Chuang Tzu 

There are thousands of books people could read to get an understanding of philosophy, but my recommendation (that has worked for me so far) is to research a particular philosopher/school of thought and read what interests you first. There's nothing wrong with, say, starting in the Romantic era then jumping to the Enlightenment."
3968,hwgtat,5,"Philosophy is vast so you might want to check what it is that you want specifically. As for a suggestion Think by Simon Blackburn can serve as an introduction to philosophy. Also some philosophical fiction suggestions:  the Stranger by Albert Camus, The Plague by the same author, Sophie's world by Jostein Gaarder(this book is also a great introduction to philosophy)."
3969,hwgtat,8,Would reccomend The Outsider and The Myth if Sisyphus
3970,hwgtat,6,"Depends on the area of philosophy you're looking to get into, but maybe start with the German philosophers--nietzsche, heidegger, etc. and then go from  there. 

Another way to sample areas of philosophy is to read fiction in these areas, e.g. a really good intro to sartre is his play No Exit."
3971,hwgtat,3,siddharta
3972,hwgtat,9,"Hello mate! I’m a philosophy major at university and in my studies my personal favorites go read have been beyond good and evil by Nietzsche, nausea by Sartre, and The Republic, by Plato. These are the works I’ve encountered in my studies that I feel have changed my life. Hope this helps."
3973,hwgtat,3,Thanks. I thought The Republic is a book on politics.
3974,hwgtat,4,"dostoevsky,  tolstoy, camus, David Foster Wallace, and milan kundera are good in terms of fiction. especially notes from underground, infinite jest, brothers karamazov, the idiot, anna karenina, and the unbearable lightness of being (my personal favorite)

either/or by Søren Kierkegaard

Victor Frankl pretty much anything of his on logotherapy 

The will to power by Nietzsche

On the Heights of Despair by Emil Cioran 

Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul sartre 

And obviously the greeks. I personally prefer watching videos for the greeks since the writing isnt always that fun for me. I think fiction in general is great for philosophy tho. as long as im reading good books i can usually gain insight to how i see the world based from the thoughts of an author. Out of all of these I think Milan Kundera would be a great place to start."

3976,hwgtat,6,"It’s a book on politics and other things. It focuses on justice, and what it means to be a just man. It is where we get platos allegory of the cave, which I consider to be one of the most important philosophical works in history."
3977,hwgtat,3,Marcus Aurelius - Meditations
3978,hwgtat,3,Read History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell. It gives you a great grasp of philosophy and it is continual growth through the ages. Then if you want American Philosophy read American Philosophy by John Kaag.
3979,hwgtat,3,"Desartes and Pascal are some of my favorites! Descartes is basically philosophizing via the Matrix if that makes sense. so basically, his starting point is just, ""what if everything around me is not real."" it's super interesting. then Pascal is a reaction against Descartes but also so good."

3981,hwgtat,13,The Plague is very timely right now.
3982,hwgtat,9,"Honestly, I'd suggest starting with Sophie's World, and then moving on from there depending on what you like the best.

But also Satre's 'No Exit' is a classic"
3983,hwgtat,7,"1. Think about which question you are interested in most
2. Type every word of the question into [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/)
3. Pick the books from the sources that sound most fun to you.
4. Read"
3984,hwgtat,3,"this is not Camus, but Nausea by Sartre is also impressive and quite close to Camus' writing and philosophy."
3985,hwgtat,3,"I suggest the republic, it’s gives insights on almost every branch of philosophy. After reading it, you might know what interest you and this can guide further reading: metaphysics, morals, social and political philosophy, existentialism, etc."

3990,hwirba,3,Okay so I have become obsessed with Nora Roberts over lockdown. Her novels aren’t strictly erotica so might not be quite what you’re looking for but they’re crime with very erotic romantic scenes. Strong recommend if you like your porn with a plot!
3991,hwirba,3,Get a Life Chloe Brown. It can’t decide if it’s a romance or erotica. About halfway in it decides erotica is the way to go.
3992,hwirba,3,Anais Nin
3993,hwirba,3,The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang is a traditional romance but its got a lot of steamy scenes. I'd also recommend Megan Hart's books - my favorite is Dirty.

3995,hwn8hj,3,"[**The Great Stink**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335607.The_Great_Stink)

^(By: Clare Clark | 372 pages | Published: 2005 | Popular Shelves: historical-fiction, fiction, mystery, london, historical | )[^(Search ""The Great Stink"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The Great Stink&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Clare Clark’s critically acclaimed The Great Stink “reeks of talent” (The Washington Post Book World) as it vividly brings to life the dark and mysterious underworld of Victorian London. Set in 1855, it tells the story of William May, an engineer who has returned home to London from the horrors of the Crimean War. When he secures a job trans­forming the city’s sewer system, he believes that he will be able to find salvation in the subterranean world beneath the city. But the peace of the tunnels is shattered by a murder, and William is implicated as the killer. Could he truly have committed the crime? How will he bring the truth above-ground? 
&gt;
&gt;With richly atmospheric prose, The Great Stink combines fact and fiction to transport readers into London’s putrid past, and marks the debut of a remarkably talented writer in the tradition of the very best historical novelists.

3997,hwn8hj,3,"I enjoyed Aaronovitch’s River of London series for the little details about the place. 

But for atmospheric London, I’d recommend Sherlock Holmes stories, and I’m enjoying Eleanor Updale’s Montmorency series."
3998,hwn8hj,3,I mean Sherlock Holmes seems like an obvious suggestion but I’ll put it out there. Also Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman is at some points very true to the London atmosphere. Perhaps some stuff by Agatha Christie! I hope some of these catch your fancy even if they don’t end up catching the London spirit you are looking for. Best of luck!

•dead poets society (the film was very true to the original book so if you liked that i’m sure you’ll like the book. very poetic and heart wrenching, plus i can’t read it without thinking of robin williams)"
4017,hwook6,93,"Cannot agree with you more. Its not about how it ends that makes it “destroy”ing.... it will destroy you every page you’re reading it, but in the most beautiful way. I don’t know how she manages to write every line with such depth of emotion. Try Circe by her as well."

4137,hwook6,22,"Agreed with the other posters! Circe is equally beautifully written, and there are certainly some sad and lonely parts, but overall the tone and the ending is more triumphant and about self-acceptance than the heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching, bittersweet fuckery that is the Song of Achilles. Go ahead and read, I’d say! Stick with it!"
4138,hwook6,20,"I read this book when I was like 8 and several times over as I grew up. I think I always knew it wasn't quite right but as I got older and realized what was going on it got sadder and sadder. Definitely not a book that should be accessible to children. But I had terrible parents who paid no attention. 

Another book I read over and over was A Child Called It. That one still gets me upset too."
4139,hwook6,3,What?!
4140,hwook6,12,"It will break you, honestly, and I have a soft spot for animals as it is. The blows just keep coming in the book all the way to the end. Its devastating and real and so incredibly human. This book will destroy your heart and also show you the beauty of man's relationship to animals and nature. Its a great read and it holds up."
4141,hwook6,3,"I mentioned this in a similar post recently, but I start crying just watching the trailer for the movie."
4142,hwook6,7,Read Beloved in a humanities class. The teacher has a mild obsession with the southern gothic. That book made me cry multiple times.

4150,hwook6,3,A little life .... disclaimer I hate this book but it’s incredibly well written and checks all your boxes
4151,hwook6,3,"Even though it's a YA book, I read it as an adult and bawled my eyes out-  The Fault in our Stars."
4152,hwook6,5,My sister's keeper by Jodi picoult
4153,hwook6,3,Lol still makes me teary too saaammmme. Twilight is definitely of it's time but I'll be damned if it doesn't still get me
4154,hwook6,37,This. The only book after that’s come close to breaking me this way is The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai. Honorable mention to Normal People by Sally Rooney. It made me so sad i started a fight w my boyfriend
4155,hwook6,18,Did she give you a DVD of that Futurama episode with Fry's dog for your 16th?
4156,hwook6,10,Yep. This book is raw because it’s 100% true. I’m still haunted every now and then by it.
4157,hwook6,6,"Are you an animal lover? If so, I recommend _We are All Completely Beside Ourselves_ by Karen Joy Fowler. Pen/Faulkner award and short-listed for Man Booker. This book just WRECKED me. ... Also, It's been a while, but if you want a love story, _The God of Small Things_ by Arundhati Roy."
4158,hwook6,6,Only book that has ever made me bawl my freaking eyes out.
4159,hwook6,3,Came here to recommend this. Phenomenal book. Gorgeous writing. It made me FEEL. And it stomped on me.
4160,hwook6,12,Me before you.. sappy predictable beach read but somehow I still ended up sobbing at the end
4161,hwook6,4,I think you mean Art Speigleman’s Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel “Maus”.
4162,hwook6,3,"Oh, god. ... _The Painted Bird_. ... This is a painful but necessary read (and also controversial for various reasons). Will never forget it."
4163,hwook6,8,Come here to recommend this one! Makes me sob every time I read it
4164,hwook6,23,My therapist has forbidden also
4165,hwook6,30,"This one. This is my second favorite book of all time. I recommend it to everyone I know, especially people dealing with loss. Everything about A Monster Calls is beautiful, terrible, devastating, heart wrenching. From the story itself to the haunting artwork in the original illustrated edition. I sat in the fetal position and cried for hours after finishing it the first time. Still cry every time.

Edit: also wanted to mention the Knife of Never Letting Go, by Ness as well. Not as crushing, but still emotional."
4166,hwook6,8,Hella yeah. Faulkner met his match
4167,hwook6,8,"Books by John Steinbeck! **The Pearl**, **Burning Bright** and **Of Mice and Men**

Also **The Green Mile** by Stephen King (not horror!)

And also **The Kite Runner**"
4168,hwook6,23,"Oof. I read it all in one night because I naively kept thinking as I read, “things will get better, right? Things can’t keep getting worse, right?!”"
4169,hwook6,3,A Little Life 😭
4170,hwook6,5,Also came here to recommend this. The writing is so beautiful it hurts
4171,hwook6,19,"Yes, yes yes. This book breaks my heart in so many ways."
4172,hwook6,3,A thousand splendid suns by Khaled Hosseni
4173,hwook6,3,Oh yeah hard agree on this one
4174,hwook6,3,+1 for When a Breath Becomes Air. Beautifully written. Textbook example of poignant.
4175,hwook6,3,"Books that broke my soul into a million pieces but I have no regrets:

- Out of Darkness: Ashley Hope Perez

- We were liars: e. Lockhart

- White Oleander: Janet Fitch

- Love letters to the dead: Ava Dellaira

The summaries that were published for these books withheld the perfect amount of detail and do NOT do the book justice at all. These are perfect examples of “don’t judge a book by its cover (and summaries)”. 📚"
4176,hwook6,5,"I read the Fault In Our Stars on a recommendation even though it’s not my usual type of book. The whole second half I was just ugly crying. I’ve never sobbed so hard in my life as I did reading that book, and I’ve never touched it again."
4177,hwook6,20,I’m sorry but the idea of The Road as a beach read just made me laugh 😂
4178,hwook6,3,A Thousand Splendid Suns and the Kite Runner
4179,hwook6,6,THIS!! THIS IS THE ONE!!
4180,hwook6,8,"A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khalid Hosseini
Author of The Kite Runner. I wanted more pain after reading it and this was the only other book of his out at the time. I would say ATSS is by far the more tragic of the two and has more heart wrenching situations, even ending on a more somber note. This is what leaves you feeling empty and sad."
4181,hwook6,15,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Foer. Don’t even try and see the movie...
4182,hwook6,3,White Oleander
4183,hwook6,5,"Agreed
I love that book"
4184,hwook6,3,A Little Life
4185,hwook6,4,the goldfinch just... my heart
4186,hwook6,6,"Wow, that strikes me as so beautiful. It's awesome how school can create these opportunities for kids to grow together, beyond just academically. I remember teachers reading chapter books to us as a class in elementary school and how cool it was to experience the book together. I also remember how we'd beg her to read just one more chapter."
4187,hwook6,7,"Yep, one of the very few books that’s ever made me cry. So heartbreakingly beautiful and incredibly written."
4188,hwook6,3,"Lamb really caught me off guard reading it. It was a comedy, and obviously I knew how it was going to end, and yet there I was sobbing."
4189,hwook6,3,a little life by hanya yanagihara
4190,hwook6,3,A Little Life
4191,hwook6,4,Shoot. I bought it on purpose but haven’t read it yet. At least I can mentally prepare
4192,hwook6,6,The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende
4193,hwook6,3,All the light we cannot see by Anthony Doerr
4194,hwook6,7,"it really was beautiful! we were in fifth grade so we all tried to act tough while reading through it but the book just took us under and we couldnt help but cry together. definitely felt like a moment i’ll never forget. I’m happy i was reminded of this! and aw! that seems even more sweet, having a teacher read to you. what i remember from school is the teachers asking the students to “popcorn” read: we’d all take turns reading and call a random person to read after us. always fun :) but having your teacher read to you was probably awesome"
4195,hwook6,4,"*Bastard out of Carolina* by Dorothy Allison hits hard. It remains the only novel to so destroy me that I threw it across the room. 

It's a beautifully devastating novel."
4196,hwook6,22,"I cried so hard at the end of Time Traveler's Wife that my father ran in from the room next door to check on me. When he saw I was crying over a book, he just backed out quietly with this totally helpless look on his face."
4197,hwook6,3,"I will always recommend ""Bridge to Terabithia"""
4198,hwook6,12,"I stopped the first time after about 150 pages. I picked it back up two years later (last month) and I destroyed it (only cried once). I can see how people may not get into it right away because nothing really happens of importance for quite a while, so the character development seems over burdensome. Then the book took me on an emotional roller coaster. I loved the protagonist, he was sweet, adorable, but then I hated him because he was stubborn and pissing me off when people were trying to help. Then I loved him again, then I hated his friends, then I loved his friends and hated him. The book is great. I would just suggest not giving it away quite yet. Set it on the bookshelf and give it another shot in a little bit. I'm so glad I ended up reading it.

Edit: Spelling because I'm wine drunk"
4199,hwook6,3,I remember reading bridge to terabithia when I was younger and oh my god was it sad.
4200,hwook6,13,"I'm still mad/sad at Atonement, I think it's just going to stay that way. I definitely threw that book at the end."
4201,hwook6,6,Came here to say this!
4202,hwook6,8,The glass castle by jeannette walls made me ugly cry
4203,hwook6,4,"A Fine Balance. It’s about India in the 70s and 80s and was short listed for the booker prize so I learned some historical/political stuff and was blown away by the prose, all while spiraling into a deep book-depression."
4204,hwook6,3,Flowers for Algernon
4205,hwook6,4,Call me by your name for sure!!
4206,hwook6,4,"Know My Name by Chanel Miller, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, All the Light We Cannot See By Anthony Doerr"
4207,hwook6,3,"Oh my god, this. It's still crushing to think of that book's plot even years after reading it. Amazingly written, an excellent read, but it is emotionally brutal on so many levels."
4208,hwook6,7,Yes! I find myself saying “fkg briony”
4209,hwook6,4,"Call me by your name. I cried like a baby, it's both beautifully written and awfully sad"
4210,hwook6,31,"I read it as a teen and I've not forgotten it. I will absolutely have my children read it. In my opinion, it is not our job to protect our children from sadness, etc, but to teach them how to handle their feelings, and to learn empathy. Books are a fantastic way to explore the minds of other people. I had terrible parents too, and only had a few books. I switched to good parents and that got fixed."
4211,hwook6,5,My favorite author
4212,hwook6,3,"The History of Love by Nicole Krauss. It’s so sweet, but heartbreakingly sad and will stick with you for years. It’s all about connections, love, loss, regret, the history that connects you to you past and what you leave behind when you move forward. The ache of loneliness is palpable in this book. Such a beautiful story told through different narrators and points of view. One of my all-time favorites. 

I *bawl* every time I read The Fault in Our Stars. 

The Road has haunted me with a broken heart for over a decade now. 

Atonement by Ian McEwen is a story where just *one* moment of misunderstanding goes on to ruin so many lives forever. It’s devastating. Because no one will ever be able to go back and undo the hurt that’s been caused. 

Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. Another multigenerational story told through different points of view. Main character is a little kid desperately searching for ways to connect to his dad who died in the 9/11 attack. This book also makes me sob. 

The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood. The hopeful promise of happiness and then the absolute crashing down of it all. The loss, the heartbreak. This book is so hauntingly and beautifully written. It’s an experience all in itself to just dive in and discover how all the pieces fit together. It’s also very sad. 

The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. Kingsolver started out as a biologist before she began writing. Her relationship with and love for the earth is so clear in her writing. And if you’ve noticed the state our earth is currently in...things are looking pretty abysmal in general. That feeling of longing for better and grieving what is is something I’ve always felt underneath her writing in any of her books I’ve read. This book is about a pastor and his family with four daughters (in like the 60s?) who travel to the Congo to basically bring Christianity to the heathens living there. They’re *so* intent on just baptizing everyone and saving their souls that they’re completely blind to everything that’s actually going on around them. All their “good intentions” backfire and there are real consequences for their family and for the community they’re trying to serve that they have to grapple with. A sober and worthwhile read."
4213,hwook6,3,I was going to say this! My absolute favorite book and an impressive movie adaptation.
4214,hwook6,5,"Of Mice and Men.

Johnny Got His Gun.

Never Let Me Go."
4215,hwook6,6,"The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah. It’s historical fiction set in France during WWII, and it’s about two sisters and the roles they play in the war. I cried reading it, cried when I’d look over and see the cover, and even had a nightmare I was there the night I finished it. I woke up having a fit. From what I’ve read it’s historically accurate, and one of the characters is based on a real woman. Fucked me up."
4216,hwook6,8,"Same here, but it did leave me feeling weird"
4217,hwook6,3,"Fun fact! The book (dead poet's society) was actually based on the movie, not the other way around"
4218,hwook6,4,"I recommended The Nightingale before I saw this post. That books haunts me. I cried for about the last 50 pages, and I had a nightmare about Gaetan (not him being evil, sort of an empathy thing). When I talk about it I tear up. I am tearing up right now. I want to recommend it to everyone, but it ripped my heart to pieces"
4219,hwook6,3,Oh yeah. I ugly cried with the book AND the movie
4220,hwook6,3,Plague Dogs
4221,hwook6,3,Tiny Beautiful Things. American Dirt.
4222,hwook6,3,I saw this and I did not know it was a book oh my word
4223,hwook6,3,"The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.

But if you really want long-term destruction, read Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, then is sequel: The Mysterious Island. 

To say the least those last two taught me about getting too attached to a character"
4224,hwook6,3,"I read constantly through most of my life, and I don’t know if I’ve ever felt so personally connected to the characters in the story, and to so many of them. I’m pretty sure I actually went though the stages of grief"
4225,hwook6,11,"I read it, but didnt like it. It was just a bit much and I was honestly pretty annoyed by the characters."
4226,hwook6,3,"A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. The most heartbreaking book I've ever read, yet still my favorite. Definitely will leave your heart in pieces!"
4227,hwook6,4,A Little Life
4228,hwook6,3,"Seconded! Came here to recommend this! Book absolutely thrashed my emotions for weeks.

I suggest reading the book first then watching the movie!"
4229,hwook6,3,"The Book Thief by Markus Zusack, Milkweed by Jerry Spinelli"
4230,hwook6,8,Thanks! The wine told me to just let it go after retyping four times
4231,hwook6,14,Saw thousand splendid suns play- worst decision ever. It was very well produced but ima stick to the happy musicals from now on. Nothing like live domestic abuse to make you uncomfortable af
4232,hwook6,3,"I read both these books as kids with parents who encouraged it! They believed it was healthy to read books that are sad. It helps children develop empathy. Not defending your parents, because you know them better, but it may have made you a better person for reading these types of books!"
4233,hwook6,4,"The movie does the book so much justice, too. I loved the book but it was the movie that made me ugly cry!!!"
4234,hwook6,5,You should read Lucky by Alice Sebold. Its the story of what actually happened to inspire The Lovely Bones.
4235,hwook6,5,A Little Life - Hanya Yanagihara... proceed with caution
4236,hwook6,8,"I mean, isnt that essentially what they asked for? Cause that's what they'll get"
4237,hwook6,3,"I ugly cried, for sure."
4238,hwook6,7,"The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein if dogs do yah in every time 
Also The Green Mile by Stephen King because...just read it. And then cry. And then don’t stop crying."
4239,hwook6,3,A little life by Hanya Yanagihara. Fucked up but beautiful and heartbreaking.
4240,hwook6,6,The ending still breaks my heart and it’s been years since I read it.
4241,hwook6,6,"I was surprised to see this one so far down the thread, but then I realized the reason it’s not higher up is that 30% of the people who read it commit suicide, 30% are institutionalized afterward, 30% survive the experience but vow never to recommend it to another living sole, leaving a reckless 10% who shrug their shoulders, say, “Hey, you asked for it,” and suggest it to people like OP who ask for a book that will “take [their] heart, rip it into a million pieces, stomp on it and leave it in a ditch.”"
4242,hwook6,3,"&gt; One of my favorite books of all time but I don't know if I have the stomach to read it again.

Glad I read it once.  There is no fucking way I will ever read it again."
4243,hwook6,3,"You might want to check out his other two novels. Surprisingly, he only wrote three novels in his lifetime, and although he's still alive, he hasn't published anything in over a decade. I wonder why."
4244,hwook6,3,All of these! The Goldfinch is monumentally poignant.
4245,hwook6,3,"The Plague Dogs. If you love dogs, that book is merciless..."
4246,hwook6,5,You are absolutely right rip up your heart disturbia
4247,hwook6,3,"I would say Just Mercy got me a lot as an American taking a hard look at our ""justice system"""
4248,hwook6,3,God I will never get over that episode.
4249,hwook6,3,I just read a plot summary on wikipedia and it seems unnecessarily sad
4250,hwook6,6,It definitely is. I don’t know why anyone would write a book like that. The main character must be the unluckiest guy ever. I agree with the people who think of it as ‘misery porn’
4251,hwook6,7,"My boyfriend, our roommate, and I all watched the movie together on a whim one night because it was free on-demand. We’d seen trailers and thought it looked fun, but otherwise had no idea what it was about. By the end of it we were all absolutely bawling. Like, shuddering, gasping crying. Our roommate is not a particularly emotional dude, and I don’t think either my boyfriend or I had ever seen him cry before that night, and there we all were sobbing like children. 

Absolutely gorgeous movie, but what a gut-punch..."
4252,hwook6,4,Flowers for Algernon. I wept.
4253,hwook6,3,"same mate, same. his next book - and the mountains echoed made my cry even more."
4254,hwook6,16,"I bought both books and after reading The Kite Runner I could not bring myself to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. It is still sitting in my bookshelf until I gather up the courage to read it. The Kite Runner did me in emotionally and I have not recovered yet, and it’s been years since I read it."
4255,hwook6,3,"The Night trilogy is a set of books I wanted to share with my book loving friends as soon as I finished reading it. And at the same time, I could NOT introduce that pain to someone I cared for. It was a strong, complicated feeling."
4256,hwook6,3,This was an amazing book and can confirm that it will make you weep so deeply and fiercely that it physically hurts.
4257,hwook6,3,Third. Made me cry in high school.
4258,hwook6,3,"
If you read this, read the whole trilogy, Night is the first instalment but there are two more. I’ve read them at least half a dozen times and i have cried every since time."
4259,hwook6,15,This author made me feel like I was in Afghanistan
4260,hwook6,3,"While it seems over the top, in real life it actually isn't that uncommon sadly."
4261,hwook6,3,"Jude the Obscure scarred me as a teenager. I don't think I could ever read it again, especially now I have children."
4262,hwook6,3,"I read it when I was on Lariam (anti malaria tablets) and one of the side effects are very vivid dreams. I've relived the scene at the beginning of the story several times and it did scar me.
It is one of the reasons why I think the movie is so much better than the book, because now if I think about the book, my brain automatically thinks of the movie. The movie is not as graphic as the dreams I've had. So, the movie had a healing effect for me."
4263,hwook6,3,This! Read the book &amp; then do yourself a favor by watching the movie. Wait a bit in between. Have tissues for both hands.
4264,hwook6,6,I think ATSS if even better. You won't be disappointed.
4265,hwook6,3,It's been weeks and that book is still giving me chest pain.
4266,hwook6,3,"Came here to recommend exactly this book. Hosseini writes so vividly, but for some reason ATSS stuck with me more than TKR did."
4267,hwook6,3,"This one didn’t make me cry, mainly because I’m really desensitized to a lot of the stuff in the book as well as I normally don’t cry to books, but the physical pain part I felt, i loved the writing cause I was able to visualize everything, but in being able to visualize everything it just gave me this pain inside, it hurt my heart though if you get what I’m saying"
4268,hwook6,3,"A thousand splendid suns is the only book I couldnt finish because it left me too disturbed. Every time I think about reading it again, I feel sick."
4269,hwook6,3,Circe is definitely more adventure. Song of Achilles has adventure but will RIP out your heart.
4270,hwook6,5,"They Both Die at the End is the name of a different book that he wrote, it’s not a spoiler for the book you’re reading"
4271,hwook6,3,"Circe hits hard, but not as hard as Night. I read both of them in 10-hour sessions, and I can attest that I survived Circe, and that I did not survive Night."
4272,hwook6,3,"It’s no problem man, thank you for this, I understand the problem with kids, I have to deal with 4 kids ranging from 4-8 years old since I’m deemed the babysitter in the family, the movie had horrible cgi but I enjoyed it for the most part, I’ll see if my local library has it and I’ll probably give it a read"
4273,hwook6,3,Have you ever read Shantaram by David Gregory Roberts ?? It takes place in India mostly. It’s one of my favorites
4274,hwook6,3,"It is massive, but it had quite a hold on me. I read it in high school, so I couldn’t devote the whole day to it, but I finished it in about a week and a half. It’s also incredibly heart wrenching"
4275,hwook6,3,"A warning: not only is this book heartbreaking, it also involves bunnies violently killing each other. I feel like it’s important to give you the heads up because I went into my assigned reading of it as a 12 year old expecting a cute bunny book and that was NOT what I got"
4276,hwoxpn,5,Staring at the Sun by Irvin Yalom
4277,hwoxpn,6,The Portable Atheist edited by Christopher Hitchens will at least make you feel not alone.
4278,hwoxpn,4,I’d suggest any of the Death books by Terry Pratchett. They’re quite humours and have a unique look at death.
4279,hwoxpn,5,Being and Nothingness by JP Sartre.
4280,hwoxpn,4,"Lucretius, *On the Nature of Things*."
4281,hwoxpn,3,"Scythe, Neil Shusterman"
4282,hwoxpn,3,The myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus
4283,hwoxpn,4,"Mediations by Marcus Aurelius. Maybe after you've read a couple other books though. He starts out pretty heavy with the whole, ""you will die at any moment"" thing. But, it's an excellent source of inspiration on how to feel good with your temporary existence."
4284,hwoxpn,4,"Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari helped me put my place in the timeline of earth/mankind into perspective. Though it doesn't deal directly with life and death, I think it encapsulates the passage of time quite well.  


Also, Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut

So it goes."
4285,hwzf7o,8,"I would recommend ""Boy's Life"" by Robert McCammon

While I had some trouble getting into it at first, it perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid and seeing wonder everywhere.

Plus bike rides and mysteries abound"
4286,hwzf7o,7,Swallows and amazons by Arthur ransome. It’s a bit old now but it is about kids taking a boat out to an island and having an adventure.
4287,hwzf7o,15,"Aw I was going to say Hatchet. Haven't heard that book mentioned for ages, so good."
4288,hwzf7o,14,Something Wicked This Way Comes/Ray Bradbury
4289,hwzf7o,6,Swallows and Amazons
4290,hwzf7o,13,"*Roxaboxen* by Alice McLerran is a gentler story about a neighborhood of kids who built their own little town out of cardboard boxes. Probably not quite what you're looking for, but it's a sweet story. 

But it sounds like you want something a bit...beefier.

*Bridge to Terabithia* by Katherine Patterson is very good, but also very somber.

*The Boxcar Children* by Gertrude Chandler Warner is also good, if a bit dated.

Then there's *The Sugar Creek Gang,* by Paul Hutchens, for a more religiously themed story."
4291,hwzf7o,13,"yup!! or dandelion wine, the first book of the series. it's about summer and small town nostalgia :)"
4292,hwzf7o,7,"Arthur Ransom's _Swallows and Amazons_ is exactly what you're describing. 

I saw another comment recommending Bridge to Terabithia. That's a book about kids dying. Kinda the polar opposite of what you asked."
4293,hwzf7o,3,"My immediate thought was Bridge to Terabithia, but that’s probably not the best choice, however Hatchet is just the beginning of a 5 book series, the other books are “The River”, “Brian’s Winter”, “Brian’s Return”, and “Brian’s Hunt”, I haven’t read any of those books but I do think they’re good"
4294,hwzf7o,3,"You said Hatchet but have you read the rest of the Hatchet series? I just bought the other books to get the whole story. Rereading Hatchet too!

\-The River

\-Brian's Winter

\-Brian's Hunt

\-Brian's Return"
4295,hwzf7o,6,"Since I haven’t seen it mentioned here, the Penderwicks by Jeanne Birdsall. It’s a middle grade series about four sisters growing up, creating mischief, and having fun. It’s super sweet and when I read it as an adult it took me back to that time in my life."
4296,hwzf7o,3,"Peter Pan really captured this feeling for me. Being young, exploring an unknown world, finding things are a bit darker than you think. It’s really an excellent book."
4297,hwzf7o,3,Are you just talking about Bridge to Terabithia
4298,hwzf7o,5,Came here to say this! One of my all time favorites. The way he brings childhood to life gives me chills
4299,hwzf7o,5,The Cardboard Kingdom
4300,hwzf7o,3,So much so and his use of language is wonderful. I love this book so much.
4301,hwzf7o,8,"It by Stephen King. I know what you're thinking. Most people think this is only a scifi horror story, but the friendship and adventures of the children together really makes me think of it as an almost coming of age story, just with a murderous clown thrown in. 

Also his novella The Body is a great one. Its the basis for the classic friendship/adventure movie Stand by Me."
4302,hwzf7o,3,"Tom Sawyer.
Tom Sawyer?
Tom Sawyer!

And... how about the Famous Five from Enid Blyton? I mean, you're still a kid right?

Stephen King has some great stories about childhood, friends, forests, captures too."

Winslade, Isle Lasch | 165 pages | Published: 1946 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, psychology, philosophy, nonfiction, history | )[^(Search ""Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man's Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.

[**When Breath Becomes Air**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air)

^(By: Paul Kalanithi | ? pages | Published: 2016 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, memoir, nonfiction, biography, book-club | )[^(Search ""When Breath Becomes Air"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=When Breath Becomes Air&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'
&gt;
&gt;At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. 
&gt;
&gt;What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. 
&gt;
&gt;Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.

4307,hx0xj3,83,"If you are interested in a humorous picaresque novel, try **Candide** by Voltaire."
4308,hx0xj3,455,"This is what they say to do when asking an expert for wine advice. Tell them what you hate as a starting point.

Love this post!"
4309,hx0xj3,33,The Prophet - Kahlil Gibran
4310,hx0xj3,26,This one. Arguably the best book of its type
4311,hx0xj3,83,"Didn't hate it exactly, thought it was 'meh'. Just  - not very anything. But I respect those who liked it, and got something from it.

The book that had a profound effect on me when younger was Henry Thoreau's Walden; it's wonderful and stays with you for life."
4312,hx0xj3,6,"I didn't exactly hate the ""alchemist"", though if you're looking for a motivational, self-help book.  
""The Mastery Manual"" by Robin Sharma would be a good choice, I read this book last year and it truly had an impact on me.  
Another book that I enjoyed reading was ""the richest man in Babylon"" by George. S. Clason, it's an awesome book that is both motivational and also provides good financial knowledge :)"
4313,hx0xj3,20,"I hated The Alchemist....But I loved The Witch's Dream, by Florinda Donner"
4314,hx0xj3,11,I thought the alchemist was meh too. Didnt see what the fuss was anout. Try The Tao of Physics. Thats a great book.
4315,hx0xj3,12,"Tao Te Ching. I'm not really sure it would be considered in the same genre, but it is definitely thought-provoking and can be thought of as ancient self-help, I guess. I also thought the Alchemist was terrible, along with Ishmael and the Four Agreements, which I'd say are in the same vein."
4316,hx0xj3,19,"Life of Pi. It was much better writing in my opinion, and Pi was so progressive for his age! He was so open to learning about other cultures and then most of his learnings came from tragedy, and accident. This book holds so much knowledge and enlightenment."
4317,hx0xj3,6,"Have you read ""Veronica decides to die"" by Coelho? I thought it was better written than ""The Alchemist""."
4318,hx0xj3,16,"I haven't read The Alchemist, but one that gets brought up in the same context a lot is ""Ishmael"" by Daniel Quinn, which I enjoyed, even though I usually dislike self help style stuff."
4319,hx0xj3,8,"Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl

The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera 

(IMO, Frankl is a must-read, and The Alchemist is a must-skip)"
4320,hx0xj3,4,"I didn’t care for The Alchemist either.  Something I read recently and really enjoyed was Gilead by Marilynne Robinson.  This is also not a book I would trend towards, but easily in my top 20 reads."

4323,hx0xj3,11,Jitterbug Perfume by Tom Robbins
4324,hx0xj3,8,I always feel like the allegory in this one gets overlooked and I don’t know why!
4325,hx0xj3,13,Read Walden my freshman year of college and though it takes some getting used to it was huge for me
4326,hx0xj3,7,"I agree! I think a lot of people just connect with books that they can personally relate to. I totally understand this, I’ve read plenty of books that I loved because I resonated with the characters personally. 

I have nothing in common with Pi. However the prose in this book, his journey, the connections he makes, and the revelations he discovers just really moved me. I love this book so much. Haha can you tell!?"
4327,hx0xj3,10,This is one of my favorite books!!
4328,hx0xj3,3,I hated The Alchemist too. You should try {The Shack} by William Paul Young as it is on the same theme but is extremely popular. I should tell you though that I hated that one too.
4329,hx0xj3,31,"I think the writing of The Alchemist is beautiful, but self sabotages in that it tries to be something it isn’t (philosophical when it is pseudo-philosophical at best). For a book that marries beautiful writing with something more introspective, I’d recommend The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera."
4330,hx0xj3,41,I can't think of a good suggestion right now but I'm so happy to discover that I'm not alone in hating The Alchemist.
4331,hx0xj3,21,"Yes, I liked the alchemist because it was the first time i read something like that, but siddhartha was excellent and I liked it even better"
4332,hx0xj3,3,"That book was on our reading list for my senior year, it SUCKED"
4333,hx0xj3,48,All of Hesse’s work has that sort of philosophical vibe tbh.
4334,hx0xj3,12,I would say Glass Bead game also by Hess is maybe and even more engrossing and thorough version of this genre but Siddhartha is amazing.
4335,hx0xj3,4,yep same found it very lacklustre as well. i’d recommend man’s search for meaning by viktor frankl. it is slightly different but does come under philosophical and motivational.
4336,hx0xj3,76,"I never understood why The Alchemist is considered self-help.  Yes, it has a life lesson in it, but don't many novels?  As to your question, maybe try The Pearl or Tortilla Flat."
4337,hx0xj3,9,"How dare you 1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1 :0 


It’s alright , try the plague or the stranger by Albert Camus"
4338,hx0xj3,11,"I also felt underwhelmed by it, but a great book that also have a similar fantasy motif and reminded me a bit of The Alchemist is “One Hundred Years Of Solitude” and to this day it’s still one of the best books I’ve read."
4339,hx0xj3,13,"Man's Search for Meaning from the title seems to be over promising. But it definitely holds up, so glad I read that book when I was in college. Changed my perspective on a lot of things."
4340,hx0xj3,4,Voltaire is great. Still funny all these years later.
4341,hx0xj3,8,Yes - I read it at the same age and perhaps that's why it really hooks you -  the nice thing about it is that Thoreau was really interested in what he was doing; the effect on his mind and spirit of  roughing it in the wilderness...he wasn't looking for a three-book deal and a Netflix mini-series.
4342,hx0xj3,4,"I've read Ishmael and the Alchemist and the former was definitely better in my eyes. Ishmael never made a connection with me. Better than both of those though is Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. 

It comes down to your personal philosophies. Looking for a personal connection from books is going to vary widely from person to person."
4343,hx0xj3,5,"I remember feeling like that too when I read it. Like just, underwhelmed. 

I’d suggest ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, by Margaret Atwood. It’s obviously a dystopian novel, so hardly self-help, but it’s one of the most thought-provoking books I’ve read. It’s full of those passages that makes you pause, and that stays with you years after you read it."
4344,hx0xj3,22,Exactly. I like Narcissus and Goldmund quite a bit
4345,hx0xj3,6,Loved this book. Must read for anybody looking for a good philosophical story.
4346,hx0xj3,15,Hilariously I liked The Alchemist and *hated* Siddhartha.
4347,hx0xj3,7,Love love love Narcissus and Goldmund!
4348,hx0xj3,5,What a truly incredible book and person. I especially like that it had such a positive message in contrast to a lot of other Holocaust books (understandably so! But it can be really soul crushing to just read about misery and suffering)
4349,hx0xj3,3,"Same here. It was so hyped by so many people, then I read it and it felt like...meh 

Didn’t really connect with the philosophy of the book"
4350,hx0xj3,4,"I liked the ending. If you read Carlos Castaneda or Shogun, you realize that both the endings are true."
4351,hx0xj3,5,"And Copland’s composition! I find myself singing it often, “who thought that this is the best of all possible worlds?!”"
4352,hx0xj3,7,I've been trying to finish *The Glass Bead Game* for over 5 years.
4353,hx0xj3,8,Omg I'm so glad you said this. I hate that book so much.  Read The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. It's not exactly the same genre. But it's a very thought provoking book which sticks with you for a really long time.
4354,hx0xj3,3,The Shack is dross.
4355,hx0xj3,3,"How about “of mice and men”?
I love the sad and realistic portrayal of dreams in this story."
4356,hx0xj3,6,"Yeah, I find myself struggling to finish their books a lot. I know they’re a great author and that there’s a lot of valuable wisdom to be found but other than Steppenwolf, their works just haven’t been my cup of tea."
4357,hx0xj3,11,"I really loved steppenwolf by Hesse, it was eye opening when i read it, it gives you some kind of insight of the human possibilities, and some energy to rediscover yourself. Really recommand it"
4358,hx0xj3,3,"I’ve been trying to read The Alchemist for years. I keep reading to the same point and just getting bored with it. 

Definitely following here for more recommendations!"
4359,hx0xj3,14,The Little prince - Antoine de Saint exupery
4360,hx0xj3,10,"I think you nailed why I have such mixed feelings on this book. I love the story itself, the journey and the adventure the protagonist goes on. But the lesson (hamfisted as hell as well) is just...meh."
4361,hx0xj3,5,"Try ""Don Quixote"". It's different, kinda philosophical comedy and thought provoking. Not an easy read but I can bet most people can enjoy it."
4362,hx0xj3,3,"I almost burnt The Shack. I have never hated a book so much. I loved The Alchemist when I read it in my late teens. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone older.    
Quite funny what works for people and not others."
4363,hx0xj3,11,"Hmm.. from the top of my head i can vouch for these, but bear in mind that these are only samples of the authors' works, nevertheless i strongly recommend most (if not the whole) of their works:

* Herman Hesse: Siddharta, Der Steppenwolf;
* Albert Camus: The Plague, The Fall, The Stranger, The Happy Death (i love them all);
* Franz Kafka: The Process, The Metamorphosis;
* Jorge Luiz Borges: Labyrinth, The Aleph (another favourite of mine);
* Gabriel Garcia Marquez: One Hundred Years of Solitude, Love in the times of Cholera;
* Haruki Murakami: Kafka On The Shore, Nowegian Wood."
4364,hx0xj3,5,"Well no, OP asked for suggestions from people who hated it lol"
4365,hx0xj3,4,No suggestions but please don't say self help is philosophical. Philosophy is way better.
4366,hx0xj3,3,"YAY ANOTHER PERSON WHO HATED THE ALCHEMIST! To me it felt like something shallow pretending to be deep, and new pretending to be old. It was written in 1988 but tried to look like it was written 2000 years ago. It’s message was dumb and modern and simple, and the random unexplained magic was... random. The thing about the desert girl waiting for him was random women relying on man and waiting and stuff indicative of something old, but it’s just so fake. I like reading old things, such as the 2000 year old Roman Satyricon, which I unlike the Alchemist is actually deep and actually funny. I also liked The Life of Pi, which had an equally great movie. I feel like the book I’m reading right now is also very deep, Reading Lolita in Tehran."
4367,hx0xj3,5,wasn't her a student of Carlos Castaneda?
4368,hx0xj3,5,My coworker suggested Sophie's World! I also liked The Journey of Ibn Fattouma by Naguib Mahfouz (same theme as The Alchemist - discovering yourself etc etc but I thought it did a way better job).
4369,hx0xj3,7,Just here to say that I always thought Coelho was overrated by Brazilians just for being a Brazilian author. Knowing that he's overrated everywhere gives me some inner peace for some reason...
4370,hx0xj3,33,"That's an interesting approach... Btw I hate Chablis, does anyone have a suggestion?"
4371,hx0xj3,5,I was just about to recommend this! Now I don’t agree 100% with everything Quinn said in the book but it was a good jumping off point
4372,hx0xj3,5,I was also questioning what makes it self help.
4373,hx0xj3,49,"Probably because it doesn't actually contain any universal truths, just banalities meant to make you feel good."
4374,hx0xj3,23,"What part of the Chablis do you hate, let’s have some fun!!"
4375,hx0xj3,6,"I hate *The Alchemist* with passion. Try *The Tree of Man* by Patrick White. It's *The Alchemist*'s perfect opposite - beautifully written, quite dense and it will make you think a lot."
4376,hx0xj3,3,"Like all Brazilian soccer/football players! Because they’re from Brasil, they go for insane transfer prices"
4377,hx0xj3,4,"I’m with you.  Underwhelmed.  If you want a better story about a boy crossing the desert in search of enlightenment, I would suggest The Journey of Ibn Fattouma, by Egyptian Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz.  It's definitely not a self-help book, but you might find something unexpected.  Or if you don’t mind having a little religion mixed into your lesson, you might try The Horse and His Boy, by CS Lewis."
4378,hx0xj3,3, Yes.  She disappeared after his death
4379,hx0xj3,13,"i’m super thick, are you being sarcastic or serious?"
4380,hx0xj3,5,When Breath Becomes Air is beautifully written and very impactful. I loved this one.
4381,hx0xj3,3,"Paulo Coelho sucks, try anything from Hermann Hesse. Maybe start with Demian."
4382,hx0xj3,4,Letters to a Young Poet - Rilke
4383,hx0xj3,3,I second “the richest man in Babylon”. Maybe also “The Last Lecture” by Randy Pausch.
4384,hx0xj3,15,"Mostly, I don't like the sharp mineral taste; and it can sometimes get too acidic for my taste too."
4385,hx0xj3,54,"Oo ok cool. So we’re looking for something that has more of a fruit forward structure to it, and is probably a little rounder in the mouth without the acidic backbone to it?? In that case a delicious grape I would recommend is a Chenin Blanc. Let me do some quick searches in my books for a solid region and winery that can hit that note for you!

Edit: depending on what you have available in your area I would say a chenin blanc from either Vouvray or California would be really fun!!"
4386,hx0xj3,16,I'm serious! It's useful.
4387,hx0xj3,20,"I’d go for a German or alsacian Riesling, goes from dry to sweet depending of your taste."
4388,hx0xj3,3,"Candide was actually one of the few classics I had to read at school that I liked with l’étranger by Zola

Edit: Camus...brainfart."
4389,hx0xj3,5,"I was going to suggest East of Eden by the same author. It's life changing and thought provoking in the show-don't-tell way, which I greatly enjoy."
4390,hx0xj3,6,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
4391,hx0xj3,3,"I just finished this book and really didn’t like it. There’s so much parallel between CS Lewis’s land of Colarman and the ignorant, racist things I hear about an area of our world that I simply could not help thinking repeatedly that CS Lewis was incredibly racist. I understand it’s a made up world, but the insane amount of parallels made me disgusted often at the author (and not the characters the author was attempting to make me mad at). I like most of his other books, but this one really makes me mad."
4392,hx0xj3,4,I absolutely hated the alchemist. Wanted to say thanks for posting this!
4393,hx0xj3,3,I hated it so I purposely don’t know anything the same.  Feel good book for the easily pleased
4394,hx0xj3,19,"Hmm. I've come on this sub after so many years, but I'm glad to see this title is still being regurgitated to anyone asking for a recommendation for anything even remotely relatable. 

This book is an archaic product of our tendency as a Western people to exoticize Eastern cultures and customs. A single dose of foreign words and concept salad for the philistine who wants to read something *different.* 


&gt;...in the shade of the sallow wood and the fig tree, Siddhartha, the handsome Brahmin's son, grew up with his friend Govinda. The sun browned his slender shoulders on the river bank, while bathing at the holy ablutions, at the holy sacrifices. Shadows passed across his eyes in the mango grove...

Patronizing, shallow, over simplified. Don't take my word for it, look at the 1-star reviews on Goodreads and see all the Buddhists and Hindus who describe it as condescending and offensive. But it's on like every single list of ""must-read-books by the age of XX"" so it must be amazing, right?

Edit: Downvotes only make me stronger."
4395,hx0xj3,7,+1 on that
4396,hx0xj3,4,My whole school was forced to read it when I was in high school. One of the main points brought up was that it was “fake deep” (pretending to be deep but instead being incredibly shallow).
4397,hx0xj3,6,I will confirm that I hated the Alchemist and loved both of these books. Good suggestions.
4398,hx0xj3,3,"I second _The Last Lecture_ by Randy Pausch! I watched [the recorded talk](https://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/)  before reading it, and I enjoyed having his voice to remember as I read it."
4399,hx0xj3,3,This!
4400,hx0xj3,5,"""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is one of my favorite books of all time. One of the best examples of mystical realism."
4401,hx0xj3,4,"Yes. I seriously cannot understand the love that book receives. At all. Like, most books when I disagree with the general opinion of it, I can see what other people see in it, it's just not for me, but this one was just awful. The only thing I can think is that I wandered too far outside my normal circle of reading with that one and ended up seeing a completely different side of the reading world."
4402,hx0xj3,5,Thanks for your comment. I loved *Siddhartha* but it’s been a long time and I was basically still a kid when I read it. You’ve prompted me to read some other criticisms of it.
4403,hx0xj3,3,I'm currently reading Walden. I seriously love it. It seems to pry out deep insight from seemingly ordinary things. A three page description of an ant war!!!!
4404,hx0xj3,7,"I think the complicated comment was just to have a bit of fun, as they mentioned. It can be fun to dive into something you know a bit about. Especially (I imagine) if it has terminology like ‘rounder in the mouth’ or ‘acidic backbone’ that you otherwise wouldn’t get to use."
4405,hx0xj3,5,"Chenin blanc is a great suggestion! I would also suggest a mild Sauvignon Blanc, like Kim Crawford or Joel Gott. For a more tangy taste, Les Jamelles is well balanced and fresh. It's a little more acid than the ones mentionned above, but not too much (speaking as a person whose stomach is stupid, it's still my go to). It's not worth cooking with, tho. Too subtil. 
Cheers!"
4406,hx0xj3,7,This thread is so wholesome and unexpected
4407,hx0xj3,3,"If u wanna be in r/books r/suggestmeabook r/booksuggestions and r/horrorlit you have to bring up the alchemist as bad and house of leaves as divinely inspired once a week. Dont get me wrong i didn't like the alchemist but i dont hate it enough to bring it up once a week and every other week when someone karma farms ""what book do you NOT suggest"""
4408,hx0xj3,6,"I’m a librarian and I ALWAYS ask kids what the books they hated - knowing what the Don’t like can be more useful in providing accurate suggestions than knowing what they did like. In a way, dislikes are more personal than likes"
4409,hx1jxt,10,"Hi bottled_bug_farts,
I am not sure if you like sci-fi, but consider The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. It checks the boxes you mentioned, is well written, fun, and I felt good after it was finished. I hope you enjoy."
4410,hx1jxt,3,"I read this late last year - and definitely, it was exactly the kind of book I was looking for! It was really fun to read."

Story of a young black slave boy whose life takes a turn for the better - has adventures - some good some less so - falls in love - travels - meets some strange people....it's not 'happy happy' and there are some dark moments \[trigger warning\] on the slave plantation at the beginning, but it's a lovely book and it has ballooning in it too!!"
4414,hx1jxt,3,"The _Murderbot Diaries_ and _Books of the Raksura_ by Martha Wells and the _Enchanted, Inc._ series by Shanna Swendson and are all positive, diverse, and page-turning.

4415,hx1jxt,3,"My all-time favourite is The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galax by Douglas Addams. If you like a whimsical, surrealist kind of story I recommend Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami. Another great one is The Help by Kathryn Socket, hope these help!"

4425,hx3q71,7,The Iron Druid series by Kevin Hearne.
4426,hx3q71,18,"I turn to Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers during stressful times. All the Miss Marple, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Poirot stories are perfect for taking your mind off things without needing heavy emotional engagement. I hope they can help you too."
4427,hx3q71,10,"I have been wanting to read it since a long time. I thought it was a serious book series. But, I will definitely check it out now."

4430,hx3q71,6,"I feel like the Mistborn series that I'm currently reading fits this pretty well. It's a book that gets insane praise here, mostly for it's magic system (it's a fantasy series), personally as well I think it has interesting plot lines, things make sense, there are a lot of politics in book 2 and 3, but not in a boring way, it's well developed into the story. One thing I found to be a negative aspect however is that the character's aren't that interesting, most of them are very static, they are charming I guess but definitely nothing special, for you it seems that this drawback would only be a good thing however so I'd definitely recommend it, I think it's sort of what you're doing looking for"
4431,hx3q71,16,"The Martian is a good story which will hopefully carry you along. Also The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet is a lovely book with a winding story like a lazy river.

I'm sorry for your loss x"
4432,hx3q71,10,"Oh, not at all. There is a decent amount of satire of the real world, and it always felt pretty low stakes and fun, even when bad things might potentially happen.

4435,hx3q71,3,"The second trilogy is definitely a lot more lighthearted; I personally like it better than the first one. Each book feels a little more standalone as well, so you won't be missing out if you don't commit to all three.

However, I will say that the second trilogy is more character focused IMO than the first trilogy, so it may not be what you are looking for at the moment.

Wish you the best, friend!"
4436,hx3q71,11,"The Dresden Files seems like a prefect fit. Its a series about a modern day wizard detective. Its well written, fast paced, and doesn't have too high of stakes."
4437,hx3q71,3,"I just discovered Agatha Christie and she is tons of fun with little emotional effort. When someone dies it’s murder mystery fun as opposed to tragic. Death on the Nile, and Murder on the Orient Express are my faves so far. Also, great for audiobook listening. And because they are oldies but goodies I guarantee your local library has plenty to choose from :)"
4438,hx3q71,5,Sophie Kinsella books or Marian Keyes
4439,hx3q71,3,"The Raw Shark Texts by Steven Hall. It’s a fun, unique, and easy read but it isn’t emotional and it isn’t trying to be profound. 

Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Another fun one with some themes but the plot and cleverness of the story is the main reason you stick around. 

An off the wall pick might be John Dies at the End by David Wong. It’s a weird, crazy read that I found to be a joy to just sit back and go for the ride. 

I hope this helps and I hope you find some solace with reading in these hard times."
4440,hx3q71,7,"I highly recommend anything by Kurt Vonnegut. He wrote absurdist stories about this and that. They're extremely funny, well thought out, but almost expect the reader to remain detached as well."
4441,hx3q71,3,"After my father died and again when my partner died the following year, I read trash fantasy. Fast paced but nothing emotional. I ready the Anita Blake series by Laurel K Hamilton and the Rockton series by Kelley Armstrong"
4442,hx3q71,3,Oh wow. These are exactly what I am looking for. Thank you!
4443,hx3q71,5,The Seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo
4444,hx3q71,4,"I was going to say The Martian and Ready Player One, they're different but I think if you liked one you probably enjoy the other as well."
4445,hx3q71,5,"Have you read jurrassic park? I read that book when I was pretty depressed and could not put it down. I just found out my mom had liver cirrhosis and wouldn't stop drinking and was having trouble focusing on anything for more than 2 seconds.
 It actually got me reading again and was a good distraction.

A lot of the characters don't have very many redeaming qualities either so you don't have to care much about them. It's just a really thrilling edge of your seat book."
4446,hx3q71,5,Try anything by Charlene Harris.
4447,hx3q71,21,"The Stephanie Plum series is a trashy and wonderful beach read about a young woman who takes a job as a bounty hunter to pay the rent, and constantly finds herself entangled with hot guys, hijinks, and exploding cars. I highly recommend it, you can pick up nearly any book and it will give you a quick recap of related events."
4448,hx3q71,3,"There's a lot of commentary in there, but it's mostly just very smart and very funny"
4449,hx3q71,6,Thank you! I am definitely interested in that series now
4450,hx3q71,4,"I have seen the movie, but I think reading the book would be a really good idea.

I hope your mother gets better and you feel good too. Thank you for the rec."
4451,hx3q71,6,"It's tiring after book 30 or whatever they're on now, but they're cute and a good distraction. Honestly her grandmother is the best character."
4452,hx3q71,4,"The book is scarier than the movie. I am easily scared though lol. But on Goodreads there's a lot of funny reviews from people saying they found themselves scared of dinosaurs in the middle of the night as they read the book lol.

I love the movie, and I love the book too. They're different enough that everything will still be a surprise. The book is a lot more cynical because the characters have a lot more faults. They make more selfish decisions. You're moreso along for the ride than rooting for the characters.

Thank you for the kind words."
4453,hx3q71,6,"I absolutely agree. I started reading these after my Mom died when I couldn’t get through Mystic River. After laughing out loud through six or seven of them, I could read Mystic River. The Miss Fortune series is similarly silly in a comforting way. I wish you a few hours of escape in fiction."
4454,hx3q71,6,"[useful guide to Discworld books](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Discworld_Reading_Order_Guide_3.0_%28cropped%29.jpg)

Would recommend Mort as a start, as its quite standalone but far enough in where Pratchett was really getting into Discworld himself. The first couple of books tend to be a bit more difficult (At least I found them so)

Would also recommend the City Watch novels, Men At Arms is my favourite overall depends what sort of book you fancy :)"
4455,hx3q71,7,Ready Player One is a lot of great pop corn.
4456,hx3q71,3,"The Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum series is my brain bleach series. It’s about a New Jersey girl-next-door who has turned into a bond enforcement agent for her slimy cousin, and the crazy people she has to deal with. The books are lighthearted, funny, and quick to read through. Some are a little more romance-based than others, but it’s the only book where I’ve had to put it down because I could not stop laughing."
4457,hx3q71,3,I used to love those books! I have to get back into them again.
4458,hx3q71,3,That’s a good one! I thought I wouldn’t like it and I wound up really enjoying it.
4459,hx3q71,3,"Ben Aaronovitch's Rivers of London books are fun &amp; lightweight and for a longer, crazy adventure try Reamde by Neal Stephenson.

Marisa de los Santos writes some light fiction that might be good as well. Some of them share characters but all could be read as stand-alone. Love Walked In is the first of those."
4460,hx3q71,4,Bold move recommending starting with the Death books to OP
4461,hx3q71,3,I would say Dark Matter by Blake Crouch or 14 by Peter Clines
4462,hx3q71,3,"Ooo you should check out Hear The Wind Sing by Haruki Murakami, I love his work and it’s just a nice little book about a guy and his friend figuring out what they should do. First time recommending a book so sorry if my description was kinda bad :/"
4463,hx4eaj,11,"Try some of his earlier books. Notes From a Small Island and I'm a Stranger Here Myself are pretty light and funny. 

Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams are fantastic for this category too."
4464,hx4eaj,6,Any Bill bryson travel book is just as good. Mary Roach and Mindy kaling are both extremely funny non-fiction writers.
4465,hx4eaj,9,I enjoy David Sedaris. Very funny and each chapter is like a little essay unrelated to the next v easy reading
4466,hx4eaj,5,"Second that she reads more Bill Bryson - there's also The Lost Continent \[America\] Down Under \[Australia\] and Neither Here Nor There \[Europe\]. - also his autobiography,The Life and Time sof the Thunderbolt Kid. All delightful.

As a change, try her on Three Men in A Boat by Jerome K Jerome - written  nearly 160 years ago but still funny; basically, three young men larking about in a boat and having adventures."
4467,hx4eaj,3,I think a lot of Bill Bryson books are good but I wouldn’t recommend The Lost Continent as it’s his first travel book and I had to stop reading as he comes across as bitter and snobbish.
4468,hx4eaj,3,Love Among The Walnuts by Jean Ferris!
4469,hx4eaj,3,"Christopher Moore is a fun one. His books are easy, interesting and hilarious"
4470,hx4eaj,4,"Anything Bill Bryson writes is light and humorous. 

I’m reading *The Mother Tongue* now, a history of the English language. Apparently it’s full of errors and shoddy research, but I don’t care. 

I’m particularly fond of *In a Sunburnt Country* and *A Short History of Nearly Everything*.  

If you’re looking for another author, check out Krakauer if you haven’t. His books aren’t exactly light of humorous, but they are fascinating and great, quick reads. *Into the Wild, Into Thin Air, Where Men Win Glory* and *Under the Banner of Heaven* are all outstanding."
4471,hx4eaj,3,"Jerome K Jerome: 

&gt; My toothbrush is a thing that haunts me when I’m travelling, and makes my life a misery. I dream that I haven’t packed it, and wake up in a cold perspiration, and get out of bed and hunt for it. And, in the morning, I pack it before I have used it, and have to unpack again to get it, and it is always the last thing I turn out of the bag; and then I repack and forget it, and have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment and carry it to the railway station, wrapped up in my pocket-handkerchief.

&gt; We had just commenced the third course—the bread and jam—when a gentleman in shirtsleeves and a short pipe came along, and wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing. We said we hadn’t given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point, but that, if he assured us on his word as a gentleman that we were trespassing, we would, without further hesitation, believe it. He gave us the required assurance, and we thanked him, but he still hung about, and seemed to be dissatisfied, so we asked him if there was anything further that we could do for him; and Harris, who is of a chummy disposition, offered him a bit of bread and jam.

&gt; How good one feels when one is full —how satisfied with ourselves and with the world! People who have tried it, tell me that a clear conscience makes you very happy and contented; but a full stomach does the business quite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily obtained. One feels so forgiving and generous after a substantial and well-digested meal —so noble-minded, so kindly-hearted.

&gt; It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours. I love to keep it by me: the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart. You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon. And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn’t a fingermark on it."
4472,hx4eaj,3,{A Year in Provence} by Peter Mayle is a great escapist memoir about a man who moves to Provence in France with his wife. It’s very cozy and has lots of humorous moments and silly cultural misunderstandings that bring a chuckle!
4473,hxepbq,17,The Alchemist. Originally the driving force for the journey is the approval of a woman but it becomes so much more than that by the end and helped me to find myself when I was struggling.
4474,hxepbq,43,"Try The Ginger Tree by Oswald Wynd. The story of a Scots woman in Japan during the early 20th century. There is a man, who brought her there, but she ends up dumping him and going it alone. It's a quick read."
4475,hxepbq,116,"All the Single Ladies is nonfiction about, well, single women. It has a lot of historical perspective in it too which I found fascinating."
4476,hxepbq,70,"Hey love, I'm hope you're ok, an end of a relationship is always hard but the change will be worth in the long run. A book that I've enjoyed recently is Everything I Know About Love by Dolly Alderton - now I know that sounds like the exact opposite of what you want right now, but stay with me ha. I have recommended it to all my girlfriends and they love ""stories"" aren't just relationships the author has had - it's more about relationships with herself, her work and her circle of friends. The author really inspired me to feel more independent and be your own cheerleader. 

I hope that helps 🙏 x"

4478,hxepbq,92,“ A new earth “ by eckhart tolle. It isn’t a fiction book but it puts into perspective the drama and sadness in our lives. I have been reading this and it is really changing the way I view and react to things in a positive way.

4489,hxepbq,3,"I want to start by saying I had absolutely no idea I read so many books with romantic ties, and I really need to do something to spread that shit out. 

So Atlantia by Allie Condie appears to be the closest I can get that is fiction and not a kid’s book, but I think there are still some (but not many) romantic ties in it. It’s also YA, though, so it’s perfectly fine if you choose not to read it.

I know you’re looking for something to help you heal, but a majority of the books I’ve read that might help are nonfiction and not about that. 

Dewey by Vicki Myron is about a library cat, but she also deals with a lot of issues she goes through, too (and I cannot remember exactly, but this might have included a divorce or the death of her husband). I know that it’s not perfect, but it’s the best I can do.

Squid Empire is very, very far from what you asked, and is by Danna Staaf. Before you roll your eyes and declare me insane (perhaps it’s already too late, in which case, sorry) this book (and Soul of an Octopus by Sy Montgomery) really helps take my mind off of things, and gives me the space I need to clear my head enough to process my emotions.

Sorry I couldn’t be too much help, and if my recommendations are more annoying than anything, but I felt that I had to do something. Anyways, if you read all this, my apologies, and I wish you luck on your book hunt"

4493,hxepbq,13,“Status Anxiety” by Alain de Botton (narrator of “School of Life”) is a great read that speaks about why we feel insecure in various aspects of our lives — Botton has a very humorous style of writing and explaining these topics. I found it to be a great book to read when I was at a crossroads in my life.

4498,hxepbq,25,It’s by Rebecca Traister and is readily available where books are sold. I recommend this one as well.
4499,hxepbq,8,Great book but it does have romance plots.
4500,hxepbq,8,I mean... kinda? But it's mainly about learning to live and enjoy being by yourself. It's about learning how to stand up for yourself and not take the shit the people around you try to pull on you. The romance is very unimportant. It has a few romance plots but they're not the focus of the book.
4501,hxepbq,12,"I agree with you, I just wanted to mention it for OP since &gt;!the ending involves love!&lt; and I thought that could be off putting after a breakup."
4502,hxepbq,5,"Maybe try The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series.

4508,hxepbq,5,"Oh my gosh, fiction-wise, pick up City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert. The main character is a woman who, by choice, never married or had children. She does, however, love sex. And she basically just embraces the idea that she loves being single and choosing who she goes home with without ever committing. It’s a very fresh take on feminism and empowerment of female sexuality, because it’s not actually what the book’s about. It’s just part of her character. It gave me the last boost I needed to start showing my inner femme fatale again after my divorce (I’m 28 — it’s definitely for young 20s/30s adult women)."
4509,hxepbq,3,"This is a non fiction rec, but The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin is amazing. It really helped me when I was in a rough spot.

4510,hxepbq,5,Party of One: The Loner's Manifesto. Its amazing insight into just being by yourself and introverts and more. I highly suggest this.

4513,hxepbq,3,"Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis"
4514,hxepbq,7,"Another book in a similar vein that I always recommend is Pilgrim at Tinker’s Creek by Annie Dillard. She went into the woods for a time to live alone and contemplate nature, art, the meaning of life. It’s a beautiful book."
4515,hxepbq,3,The Unexpected Joy of Being Single
4516,hxepbq,5,Wild by Cheryl Strayed
4517,hxepbq,3,You Are A Badass by Jen Sincero. I’m usually skeptical about “self-help” books but this one was very relatable and I enjoyed reading it.
4518,hxepbq,4,"I disagree. While I love the solitude of the book, I felt most of the way through that all she wanted was a man in her life."
4519,hxepbq,8,"The author focuses specifically on the female experience, but the parts where she talks about the government push for marriage were interesting for everyone.

Walden is the first book that pops into my mind that would appeal to men or a wider gender audience, but I'll give it some thought!"
4520,hxepbq,3,You are the one you’ve been waiting for by Richard Schwartz
4521,hxepbq,3,I think you nailed it! Evaristo is awesome. And GWO is so full of different voices and shows the rich web of living/being part of so many other lives — makes a standard romance narrative seem so narrow and artificial by comparison!

4538,irhp3k,6,"I suppose, but I think most of the books I mentioned him make just as serious as Orwell and Huxley. The Green Mile is one of the sweetest books on race and innocence I’ve ever read. All of the novellas in Different Seasons are pretty powerful too. Perhaps most of his books are entertainment, but to say you cannot find anything of high literary quality by him is dismissive. He has several books where his ideas and writing quality are astounding, and doesn’t limit himself to genre fiction. 

However, in my opinion, even many of his genre fiction books can have salient points on mortality, innocence, coming of age, feminism, greed, poverty, abuse, fear, isolation, race, alcoholism / addiction, power dynamics, and more, but you are likely to disagree with me on that. I recommend you give The Green Mile and Different Seasons a try. You just might like them."

^(By: Ta-Nehisi Coates | 152 pages | Published: 2015 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, nonfiction, memoir, race, audiobook | )[^(Search ""Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.”
&gt; 
&gt;In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?
&gt;  
&gt;Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.

4597,irqav5,5,"Hannah Arendts ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" is a book on the trial of the Nazi that organized the death camp trains. Arendt is a German born jewish philosopher that fled germany during the war. This book challenged a lot of the understanding we had of Nazis following the war. It also shed light on how non threatening a fascist can be. How causally we can commit atrocities. Her analysis of Eichmann almost ruined her career, but now it's an integral part of Holocaust literature.

Lars Svendson ""Understanding animals: philosophy for dog and cat lovers"" is a light read on philosophy. It's an experiment in trying to differentiate humans from other animals. It sparingly uses references to other philosophers, and when he does he explains the concept in plain English. This book brought me into my broader love if philosophy.

These are the two that I recommend to general audiences wanting to expand into academic works. Arendt is a much more serious work but it's not a hard read. I have much lighter reads, but that book was specifically I've changing to me and affected my academic career significantly.

I have a lot of American and medieval history books if you're interested in those, but I couldn't pick a couple to shill for"

It sounds boring and is hugely why I didn’t touch it, but then had to read it for a “microhistory” requirement of a reading challenge and it’s been really interesting so far!! Also, it gives me a lot of tidbits to randomly...sprinkle...into dinner conversations. Win win!"

She was the prime minister of Pakistan, later assassinated, and her story is absolutely incredible. She goes up against the dictator government that has overthrown (and later executes) her father , gets thrown in jail under martial law, lives in exile, and then comes back... and yeah, you should read it. 

There's some interesting history about the U.S. government funding that dictatorship, despite knowing about all kinds of human rights violations....the descriptions of what happens martial law, oh man.  It's incredible what she lived through.

Highly recommend."

Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakaur - interesting look on the history of Mormonism and how Fundamentalists created a schism. also provides insight on how uniquely American the idea of Mormonism is - further creating a conversation of religion in the US

The Feather Thief by Kirk Wallace Johnson really enlightened me on the world of fly fishing haha. Basically uses the heist of birds from a museum in London as a case study into the world of fly fishing and collecting. I honestly had no idea how intense it is. also provides interesting information on early collectors (darwin, etc) and the philosophy/concepts behind it. Very niche, bizarre, and fascinating."

4631,irwkon,39,"I don’t read a great deal, but I would recommend Michael Crichton books, such as Jurassic Park, Prey &amp; Timeline. I found them easy to read &amp; difficult to put down once you get into them. 

Zoo by James Patterson is also good, shame they ruined the TV series. 

A great time travel series of books by Nick Jones are The Unexpected Gift of Joseph Bridgeman (The Downstream Diaries). 

Enjoy!"
4632,irwkon,8,"I am wondering, a lot of people say Animal Farm where I would have expected them to say 1984, how come you pick animal farm instead? And Hitchhiker’s Guide is definitely one I am picking up, everyone has mentioned that one."
4633,irwkon,31,"My advice, if you want it, is to google a basic synopsis with NO SPOILERS on each of these books and then pick the three that sounds most interesting to you. Do you like dinosaurs or political commentaries? Are you in the mood for dark scenes in the bowles of an intergalactic cruiser or do you just want a good laugh and a warm cup of tea? I've read most of these books and they're all good, but this list covers a wide array of topics and a huge range of styles. Ultimately, regardless of what anyone tells you, reading is about enjoying yourself, so don't get frustrated if you don't fall head over heels for the classics and end up reading Harry Potter six times a year instead. Find something that interests you and have fun, and if you can do that then what anyone else has to say about it ultimately doesn't matter.

Happy Reading!"
4634,irwkon,3,"Read I am legend. You saw the movie? Good. You know nothing about the book! Its short but intense.


From your list; 1984 is quite boring but it will be answered a lot because asch paradigm. 

Anyways. From your own list Id say Animal Farm, 11/22/63 and the hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy.

Theyre easy reads and good books, very interesting to read."
4635,irwkon,9,"Cool! I love adding new books to my very small list. Thank you for mentioning time travel, that sounds like a really cool concept for a book."

4637,irwkon,3,Ya lit?
4638,irwkon,12,"I will do just that when I get back home. That sounds like such a smart thing to do. I just thought I’d get other people’s opinions just to create a general guideline. And yes the point of my list was to cover quite a few styles. As I haven’t read anything before, I don’t know what I like and don’t like, so I’m willing to try everything. Thank you for the great advice. Have a great day!"
4639,irwkon,3,How is stephen king not an easy read? One of the reasons hes so popular is because hes not difficult to read at all.
4640,irwkon,451,"I have read a couple of books on this list, and I feel they are a little intense for a beginner. It's better if you start off with simple fictional novels, like Agatha Christie's works (or check Goodreads for suggestions).

Your first book shouldn't be intense or require significant effort from you. If you aren't hooked from page one, you might lose interest and there are high chances reading becomes a chore rather than something you enjoy doing. So it's wise to choose simple novels that you can finish in a sitting or two (depending on how much time you spend), and ride off that feeling of accomplishment. Good luck on your journey!"
4641,irwkon,5,"Seriously, did you sneak in to my house and just list books off my bookshelf?    If you haven't tried Zoo in audiobook I reccomend it. Listened to it on a long car ride with my daughter who was 9 at the time. We both loved it. She is almost 11 now and brings it up repeatedly.  Especially if we see animals doing something odd."
4642,irwkon,132,"Wow! Great advice. I hadn’t even thought about that. I will check goodreads, but do you have any easy beginner books? Just off the top of your head. Thank you!"
4643,irwkon,5,Young Adult Literature. Just novels written with a young adult in mind. A lot of the novels on your list likely don’t have you as the intended audience. That isn’t saying they are bad—far from it—but you may not get as much enjoyment out of them based on the way you describes yourself as a reader.
4644,irwkon,3,"Well honestlym you could watch tbe movie and read the book. Its completely nothing alike.

The book, for example, is about vampires. The doctor, in the book, is VERY LONELY and battles his own suicidal thoughts (joining them) with his logic and fight (curing them) as he wanders the dangerous worlds all on his own. Its mainly focussed on his mind, there isnt so much action in there as he is very careful. 

He only goes out because he has to find supplies to repair damages the vampires caused at night.

They try to break into his house and murder him. But they also try tl lure him out. His former friends and neighbours make him almost unrefusable offers, even sexually. And the doctor has to hold himself back becauss all he wishes for is to not be alone any longer...

Theres a lot happening but I didnt spoil a thing here. Have fun. Its one of my favourites."
4645,irwkon,9,"Animal Farm for sure! If you like that political vibe then yes and it's easy to read. 

I would recommend 1984, but it's a very tough read - the middle chapters are very dense and if you haven't done much reading it will be tough. 

But Animal Farm is a must for me!"
4646,irwkon,14,"Would suggest hitchhikers, howl's moving castle and neuromancer. 

Happy reading!"
4647,irwkon,32,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was what kickstarted my reading hobby.  I listened to the first one as an audiobook, then read the next two."
4648,irwkon,19,"I think the ""classics"" are a bit much for a newbie. Of all those books, the best one is 11/22/63 - Stephen King. Easy to read, great story, Stephen King is an amazing writer that will have you immersed in the story and make you want to keep reading. It's a long book, but it's pretty great. 

I gave up on reading classics. Most were written years ago, and it's hard to relate, or the writing style is different that what you may be used to. I do not enjoy them. And I read a lot. But that's just me."
4649,irwkon,4,Maybe because of the length of most of his books?
4650,irwkon,3,Theyre usually quite long though.
4651,irwkon,11,"I disagree when people saying “classics are not for beginners”, because I find classics easier to read than many other novels (otherwise, they wouldn’t have survived their times!). 

It’s hard to recommend one (in general, not just from your list) because, for example, I HATE Kafka, and loved Orwell. Between those you listed, I’d start with the Hitchhikers Guide. If you can, get only the first book, as it’s portable, the whole series is heavy to carry around (unless you have an e-reader, of course).

I’m suggesting this because it’s a light- but clever- book, it’s funny and fast. 

Hope you can find a book you enjoy and in this way starting your love for reading!"
4652,irwkon,52,"Just to piggyback: For me personally Animal Farm is a much easier read than 1984. 1984 can get pretty heavy in the middle chunk of the book and can be a struggle to get through. And sometimes can be hard to understand. Meanwhile Animal Farm keeps you interested all the way. And it’s shorter :)

Since you said you were a beginner reader I think that’s why you’re getting Animal Farm recommended more. It’s just a waaayyy easier read. 1984 is still a great book you should check out though!"
4653,irwkon,3,Both 1984 and Animal Farm are awesome imo.
4654,irwkon,3,Were there any books you read for school that you enjoyed?
4655,irwkon,14,If you have the Kindle app and an Amazon account you can probably download a sample from most of those books. Then you can see which ones you find most interesting.
4656,irwkon,10,"Second this. Ease of reading is a big factor if you're just getting into reading as a hobby. Challenging books can out you off before you make it a habit.

Animal Farm is a great one because it reads easily but has many, many layers. You can have discussions with people that will change your perspective and make you want to read it two or more times.

For that reason I would also suggest Daphne Du Maurier's *Rebecca* and *The Turn of the Screw* by Henry James, even though they aren't on your list. They are proper **book club** type books that can be easy to read initially - but make you really appreciate them as a piece of art when you have an in-depth discussion with someone about them."
4657,irwkon,7,"I would suggest Hitchhiker's, Animal Farm and any other one of your choice. The first two are easy reads and will set you up to enjoy whatever comes next.

If I could add to your list: The Martian, Norwegian Wood (Haruki Murakami), and the Discworld novels (there's tons of them but they are easy, quick reads, *really* funny and build a huge world that you will grow to love)."
4658,irwkon,128,"Go for fun authors just now - Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Iain Banks, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Dan Brown. Your goal is to widen your range and really get into reading by enjoying it rather than forcing yourself to wade through hefty books. Go for easy reads, then level up to light classics with more complicated language but a great plot ( Treasure Island for instance) then hit the heavy weights. Also, intersperse big books  with small, fun ones so you feel like you want to keep reading. 


I’ve read some ‘serious’ literature this year and I’m mentally exhausted!"
4659,irwkon,4,Definitely read hitchhikers.
4660,irwkon,54,"I would 10000000% suggest the Narnia series for beginners. The first book (The Magicians Nephew) is quickly paced and super fun, it’s an easy read and can be found at practically any used book store for about $2.  I am currently rereading the series as an adult and am enjoying every minute of it even though it’s written for 12 year olds.

Edit: Book name error"
4661,irwkon,3,which can be a bit frustrating for someone who is not used to reading books.
4662,irwkon,5,Where the Red Fern grows.
4663,irwkon,30,"Agree on these choices. Possible substitute with Electric Sheep for F451.

1984 is much longer and more complex than Animal Farm. There are similar themes and concepts but to give perspective, we use AF in 9th grade ELA classes but 1984 in senior AP Literature."
4664,irwkon,8,I Read the boy in the stripes pajamas in school and I absolutely swallowed that book. For the first time in my life I read the entire book in one sitting just because I loved it so much. I don’t think it’s a particularly long book but it was a lot for me.
4665,irwkon,8,"Haven't read Electric Sheep, but from this list I'd suggest Fahrenheit 451.. If the whole theme doesn't make you want to read more books, there's something wrong with you ;)

It's also an easy to read book and not long at all, so that's a good ""first"" book."
4666,irwkon,4,"I second this! 11/22/63 is a good and straightforward book without too many philosophical or complicated elements that would otherwise make reading daunting for a beginner. 

I think once you get the hang of reading, you can dive into Orwell's works but I wouldn't recommend reading them right away. I don't think I'd have enjoyed Orwell when I just started reading. 

I recently read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I did enjoy it so that might be a good pick as well. For me, it was a little difficult to get into it at the start but once you get the hang of the writing style, it gets easier. 

Also, I saw someone else recommend Agatha Christie and I think that's a really good idea. You could pick _And Then There Were None_ or _Murder On the Orient Express_. Both are mind-blowing books imo. 

As mentioned, most of the books on your list are classics and I've not gotten around to reading most of them even though I've been an avid reader for ten years now. I enjoy Mystery/Thriller, Fantasy and Sci Fi but I do occasionally read a classic when I feel like it."
4667,irwkon,3,"Young adult literature. If you’re a new reader I definitely recommend starting here rather than the more classic list you’ve posted.

In YA, you’ll find a massive spectrum of reading abilities and genres. YA is technically ages 11-18 and since YA collections are best suited to follow adolescent development, you’ll find a huge range of topics, interests, etc. 

Most YA lit is fiction but there are a lot of really good nonfiction texts as well. If you do like the more classic texts, read “Night” by Elie Wiesel. I’ve never had a student not like it. He wasn’t a native English speaker so the reading level is easy to understand. 

I just finished “Agnes at the End of the World” by Kelly McWilliams and it was wild, I loved it. The first half takes place in a religious cult. She is the oldest of her siblings and the first few pages talk about how dedicated and faithful she is. But then also about how she meets a nurse at midnight every two weeks to get insulin for her little brother who has type 1 diabetes. As time goes on, she becomes disenchanted with the cult and escapes with said brother only to find the outside world has fallen to a pandemic! It’s SO GOOD. I devoured this book in 2 days. 

When I used teach I focused on a lot of YA lit to help my students get back into reading, to supplement fun with their required reading. For boys I always suggest “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline. The movie is 100% different and it made me so angry. So read the book! My husband doesn’t like to read but I made him once he told me how great the movie was because I had to “correct him.” He agreed with me that the book was better. 

For girls, I suggest a lot of fantasy. Fairy tale remixes are a favorite genre of mine, especially for Alice in Wonderland. “Heartless” by Marissa Meyer, “Splintered” by AG Howard, or “Alice” by Christina Henry. 

Really get in there and research the genres. See what YOU like before asking for recommendations. And just because you can read on a certain level doesn’t mean you have to. I CAN easily read Shakespeare, Milton, and Voltaire. But sometimes I just WANT to read some YA goodness! 

Check out bestselling lists for YA lit or become a peruser of Goodreads. That’s how I build my “to read” list."
4668,irwkon,9,Enders Game is a page turner
4669,irwkon,3,"Yes, I’ve read one, “IT,” and it’s great but my god. 50% of that book could be trashed and it’d still be just as successful. So many tangents, side stories, and just ridiculously long descriptions of things."
4670,irwkon,6,"Animal farm  or howls moving castle. These books would be at the reading level you have suggested, and they are both delightful. If you want whimsy, definitely howls, if you want dystopia then animal farm would be better."
4671,irwkon,5,"Fahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury

Something wicked this way comes - ray bradbury

Howl’s Moving Castle - Diana Wynne Jones"
4672,irwkon,9,"I would suggest thinking about what kinds of movies and tv shows you like, and let that help you choose. For example, I like police procedural shows like NCIS and detective books, but I don’t enjoy any kind of horror or really scary stuff. Also if you don’t like one of the books you choose, try a different author in the same genre because sometimes you might dislike one author’s style but enjoy another’s.  And consider YA books. They’re short and easier to understand but can also be high quality literature."
4673,irwkon,6,John dies at the end by David Wong. Comic horror (but mostly horror). Fastest book I've read. Fast interesting funny scary it has it all!
4674,irwkon,14,"Try “Night,” by Ellie Wiesel, then. My brother always hated reading, but I still remember that this is a book he actually read through and liked. Also, “Shades of Grey” by Ruta Sepetys. (It might be Zepetys.) Both have similar themes of struggling against oppression. Or “The Book Thief” by Markus Zusak, which is a bit more like “Striped Pajamas” plot-wise."
4675,irwkon,29,"Huge Narnia fan here, just want to point out that the book is ""The Magician's Nephew"", not son, and that most people start with ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" as it was the first one written and serves as a better intro to the world. ""The Magician's Nephew"" is more a prequel than a first book, though many do start there.

And carrying on with this train of thought- children's books or YA are the place to start when getting into reading for fun. They tend to have better pacing and while they often don't avoid thought provoking ideas, they don't tend to bog you down with too many at once.

I also recommend audiobooks for a beginner. Most libraries now have an ap (normally Libby or Hoopla) where you can check them out for free."
4676,irwkon,3,"Hitchhikers for sure. If you google the books, they almost always have sample chapters (usually the first two chapters) available.

Nothing wrong with sampling and sticking with the one that grabs your attention.

I most definitely wouldn’t start Snow Crash. Great book. Intimidating for a first read.

If you want something super easy, funny (and kinda pointless) I’d add “The Stench of Honolulu” by Jack Handey.

Great list"
4677,irwkon,4,"ope, in school we read both 1984 and animal farm in 7th and 8th grade"
4678,irwkon,6,This is great advice! I listened to an Agatha Christie audiobook (Phoebe reads a mystery podcast) earlier this year having not read a book since school and I'm on my tenth Christie now. I'd recommend Murder on The Orient Express or Death on The Nile for a first read
4679,irwkon,149,"I think that the Harry Potter books would probably be great for you as well! The first couple are shorter so you can get a feel for it and though the others are larger, you will hopefully be so engulfed in the story that it won’t matter🙂📚✨
My husband also seconds the vote for Narnia!🙂🙂🙂"
4680,irwkon,3,"the twits by roald dahl is a children’s book but I still read it sometimes as it’s funny and easy language

edit: spell corrected name"
4681,irwkon,12,"I've never read 1984, but Animal Farm is very short and very clear, both in plot and themes (though it has a good few layers underneath). A fantastic introduction to the more literary side of fiction (though idk if it technically counts as 'literary fiction' because that's such an ill-defined genre. I'd say it does.), and, if you don't like it, it doesn't take *that* long to get through either."
4682,irwkon,16,"**Howl's Moving Castle** author is lovely modern children's classic for me. She wrote many absorbing, lovely books. And rip. 

You should check out all her books :) nice choiceee"
4683,irwkon,6,"I recommend Howl’s Moving Castle as it is an easy read and very enjoyable. 

It begins quickly and it’s fast paced. It isn’t too long and there are no difficult concepts or heavy subjects that make it difficult to continue reading."
4684,irwkon,4,"Here are the books on the list I find easy, gripping, and very worth reading:

* **Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984)** - George Orwell
* **Animal Farm** - George Orwell
* **Snow crash** - Neil Stephenson
* **Fahrenheit 451** - Ray Bradbury
* The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams
* Howl’s Moving Castle - Diana Wynne Jones

I like them all, but I bolded the ones I most recommend and I put them in order of how useful it will be to be familiar with them; adults will expect you to be familiar with Orwell's fiction, anyway.

I haven't read some of the rest and can't comment except by reputation/author, though I'll be looking up that Huxley book 'cause he was great."
4685,irwkon,8,"I think it depends on the specific book (what a surprise). Animal Farm is an easy read. imo, the book I constantly recommend, The Once and Future King is also a really easy read (although idk how it is without the context of knowing a little bit about how the King Arthur story works - I'd read Le Morte Darthur before it. Incidentally, that's a very difficult read.). Something like *Jane Eyre* or *Sense and Sensibility* is a more difficult read, and Dickens is a whole other thing.

All of those, afaik, qualify as 'classics', though I might be wrong."
4686,irwkon,148,The Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan would be super quick and fun as well!
4687,irwkon,7,"I love the classics but to be fair part of why they “survived the times” is because they were defined as “the classics” by institutions and thus, kept as a part of the main literary cannon that institutions of learning have condoned as ones that SHOULD be taught so most people are exposed to these classics in schools. Often, these books are defined for “beginners” because other people (usually teachers, administrators, districts, etc) have said they should be taught to people at that age/grade level.

To answer the original question: I think a good book for beginners would start with considering one’s topic of interest though."
4688,irwkon,9,"Seconding starting with the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I am an avid reader and couldn’t get through the Magician’s Nephew."
4689,irwkon,5,"Howl's Moving Castle! OMG READ IT, it's so fun. Nothing else to say, you'll end it in one day."
4690,irwkon,57,"Just a thought here too - if you start a book and you don’t like it, there’s no shame in putting it aside and trying another one. It doesn’t mean you’re a “bad reader” or you don’t like to read, it just means that book wasn’t the one at that time. Or maybe it’s a bad book! You can always pick it up again later if you feel like it. 

That said, Harry Potter turned my best friend into a voracious reader in middle school, when she was in remedial reading class. So despite JKR being an asshat, that’s always my go-to suggestion."
4691,irwkon,11,I think this is great advice!
4692,irwkon,5,"Brave New World is a must read. I read it right before the show came out and followed up with the show(which actually wasn’t terrible). Also started with 1984 for my reading journey so that could never hurt. Altered Carbon is on my list because I adore the show so maybe those 3? Keep the list however and just slowly chip away and add to it, don’t set a deadline or a goal, just read to read and enjoy the read.
edit: although 1984 and Brave New World are a little harder to read, I’m not sure about Altered Carbon. If you must, build your way up to them."
4693,irwkon,17,"Of what you've listed, Hitchhiker's Guide, Howl, and Animal Farm are the most accessible, in my opinion. 

Of what you don't have listed, the book series that got me 100% hooked on reading was Narnia. I'd second the recommendation of starting there for several reasons:

They are charmingly written and very accessible.

The characters are easy to care about.

They can be read at different levels: straightforward fantasy adventure, religious allegory (with religious bigotry included), European colonialism, etc.

They are very very influential in fantasy.

Start with *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*, I beg. *The Magician's Nephew* is a prequel and I think it's the weakest of the lot."
4694,irwkon,6,"Hitchhikers guide, howls moving castle, Fahrenheit 451


If I also may suggest a book, look into Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. It has a similar feel to Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and it is a quick and humorous read. It’s what got me into reading again as a young adult."
4695,irwkon,8,"Rebecca is the first book that I ever stayed up all night reading! I didn’t realize it until the sun started to come up and I was like, “Oh, shoot, I’ll just finish this chapter” lol"
4696,irwkon,5,I'm also just getting into reading for pleasure and one book I loved that isn't on your list is Ender's Game.
4697,irwkon,5,"The first third of 1984 is phenomenal and the last third is a clean thematic tie-up, but the middle part is a slog and therefore I cannot recommend it as an introduction to reading-as-a-hobby.

Brave New World may be a good choice as it is somewhat short and you'll be able to see how you feel about analytic reading - relating what you have read back to the real world. However, there are some rather hefty philosophical arguments at the books climax.

I loved animal farm so much. It reads like a dark children's book, and covers such strong and relevant themes that are worth pondering both as a snapshot of history and a window into the modern world.

For a beginner, the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is probably one of the best possible choices. Truly entertaining, the author is celebrated for a reason. 

The rest, I haven't read or am currently reading, so I can't help you further based on personal experience. I've heard mixed reviews of Fahrenheit 451 and Neuromancer is a very specific sub-genre to try to break into, but if cyberpunk interests you go for it.

Have fun!"
4698,irwkon,3,I was going to recommend these three as well. It’s a great line up and you can’t go wrong :) good luck!
4699,irwkon,3,Howl's Moving Castle - Hitchhiker's Guide - Animal Farm
4700,irwkon,7,"Animal Farm is more approachable and entertaining than 1984, in my humble opinion."
4701,irwkon,23,"I agree with the top comment about simpler reads, Harry Potter is always a good go to for those. I also really like rainbow Rowell’s books if you’re into romance. If you want a nonfiction that reads like fiction read born a crime by Trevor Noah (super funny) or I will always write back. Howls moving castle on your list is also one of my favorites but let me warn you the plot is INTRICATE. So maybe save that one for a little bit later."
4702,irwkon,4,Rick Riordan’s books are all an easy read with an exciting plot. Highly recommended!
4703,irwkon,112,Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy I read in high school and it lead to a lifelong love of sci-fi and humour. It’s so great.
4704,irwkon,5,"I have Yet to read the Discworld novels, but I am pretty sure that the first book is a poor representation of the series, and I think that it deserves a warning
Correct me if I'm wrong tho :)"
4705,irwkon,5,"Awesome, then I'd definitely start with similar books. Don't feel pressured to read ""the classics"". Reading is a muscle that develops over time and jumping into something super dense or very deliberate with prose can feel like trying to run a marathon with no training.

Maybe even look into that author's other works if you liked the wrong style. Otherwise, look for similar settings/themes if that's what you connected to. No shame in sticking with what you know as long as you're enjoying it."
4706,irwkon,7,"""just to piggyback"" haha love the pun"
4707,irwkon,3,I second Night and Between Shades of Grey! Both of those I was really in the story- I didn't put those down.
4708,irwkon,6,Seconding Michael Crichton. I read all of his published books (at the time) during high school when I wanted to read for fun outside of assigned reading.
4709,irwkon,7,"I agree with Animal Farm and Farenheight 451. 

Both are eerily appropriate right now too."
4710,irwkon,34,"I second this one! I actually came here to suggest this out of all the listed books, as I kind of agree with u/__TheIceMan__ about many of the books looking pretty intense for a beginner. For me, The Hitchhiker's Guide has always been very easy and fun to get into (even on repeat readings), particularly as I enjoy the absurd and wonderful use of language. It is an absolute joy to read."
4711,irwkon,12,Try Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer.
4712,irwkon,6,Animal Farm is nice and simple but it’s a great book when you understand the background!
4713,irwkon,22,"Stephen King is a great story teller but his novels are usually very long (500+ pages).

It took me 3-4 attempts to start Neuromancer.  It’s a good book but not the easiest to read.

Tip: get a public library card and download the Libby app if you want to read e-books for free."
4714,irwkon,4,"JKR being a bad person doesn't affect the quality of the book,  the writing style in the whole harry potter series is so incaptivating and always keeps you coming back for more. I love the books and only a handful or even less authors are as good as she is at writing in such a way that you can't stop reading. Dan Brown comes close or might be better tho."
4715,irwkon,12,"THIS.  I’m read 40 or 50 books a year.  What I do is download what I’m interested from to my e-reader from the library or as a sample from Amazon, read a bit, and If I don’t like it, return it or delete the sample.  Then I move on to something that grabs me. 

Even if you don’t  have an e-reader, you should be able to get kindle app in phone, and use it to get samples, and see what you like. 

I believe everyone can be a reader, it’s just a matter of finding the books that grab them.

And I think one of the best books on this list is Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury.  His short stories are amazing too, if you want something with less commitment."
4716,irwkon,11,Thirded! Best book. I had it read to me when I was in elementary school and didn’t understand it well but picked it up in middle school and blasted through all of the books.
4717,irwkon,7,The Time Traveler’s Wife is an easy read with a big plot. Some great YA books about time travel are the Wrinkle in Time series. A Swiftly Tilting Planet is my favorite of the five books.
4718,irwkon,6,"The Book Thief was going to be my suggestion too after reading this comment. 

Night is fantastic too, as is The Tattoist of Auschwitz"
4719,irwkon,5,Hilarious book. I read it and immediately bought copies for everyone I know who likes to read
4720,irwkon,25,"Yes! I think that is why a lot of people burn out on reading because of school. It makes people think reading is mentally exhausting and unenjoyable. I believe new readers and schoolchildren should be given a list of ‘appropriate’ books that increase their reading comprehension without bogging them down mentally. 

Attention span is seriously important to consider when picking a book. An example would be the Wheel Of Time series. I loved the idea of the series and was super excited through the first book and then lost steam halfway through the 3rd book. Exhausting. But the prequel novel he did for the series (New Spring) was short so the pace was quicker and more lively."
4721,irwkon,8,"Hitchhiker's Guide would be a great start. I've read most of the books on your list.  Neal Stephenson is heavy going, probably not a good first start."
4722,irwkon,8,"Exactly I know a ton of dyslexics so am a big fan of promoting ANY reading. I only recently discovered vision stress. It affects at least 1 in 10 people. So reading is incredibly tiring for a lot of people.


It’s so, so important to tell young readers that some will find reading super easy and others find it a massive trial. Then there are homes where people just don’t grow up with books at all or aren’t encouraged to read. 


I know a 7-yr-old who read the Hobbit to herself last summer and is desperate to learn Ancient Greek ( unprompted by anyone) because she loves Percy Jackson so much - but she comes from a middle class household and has the support to read. Meanwhile, my kid is dyslexic, has vision stress and loves being outside. 


I’m thrilled I get to introduce the 7-yr-old to all the classics from my childhood and thrilled if my kid willingly reads two whole sentences without stopping. 


People get so het up about ‘proper’ reading - who cares, just pick something you’ll enjoy."
4723,irwkon,3,"I agree with this. A good option is to stay with more contemporary stuff for a while, a lot of those books a older and really from a different time when people thought of things, and wrote about them, very differently.

All that said, I think there are some very accessible ""classics,"" like *The Autobiography of Malcom X* by Alex Haley. Also the Sherlock Holms stories are both immersively accessible and give you a fun picture of a very different time. Although she's not very popular here, I would also recommend Edith Wharton's big classics, *The Age of Innoscence* and ""The House of Mirth. She has a very particular talent of writing complex, idea-heavy stories that are also real page-turners. Just stick to those books, though, the others are really hit and miss."
4724,irwkon,16,I actually think Howl's Moving Castle would be a good starter book. I'd also agree with the Harry Potter recommendations. Tamora Pierce books are amazing as well- the Alanna and Circle of Magic series were some of my favs when I was younger.
4725,irwkon,3,"Honestly, I’d hold off on Hitchhikers. I’m not a great reader but I’ve tried to read this multiple times and could not get into it. When I finally painfully finished it, I was very unsatisfied. The humor was lost on me (apparently the humor is making fun of other writing styles which I don’t have much experience with) and the long/abnormal names were hard for me to follow. Just my 2 cents though. I don’t want you to try reading it and become discouraged."
4726,irwkon,3,"I had a hard time with Narnia, and I was not a begginer when I read them. Some books are extremely slow paced, it took me a while to finish the whole series, and I had to watch the movies in between to give me the motivation to keep reading"
4727,irwkon,8,Holes by Louis sachar.
4728,irwkon,10,"Absolutely! As long as the brain is being stimulated and everyone is happy, let it be. Same thing with people saying media like comic books/manga/graphic novels is not ‘real reading’. Some people just need extra stimulation to stay involved. I went through a graphic novel phase back in uni because I was so stressed that my mind couldn’t focus or picture what was going on. The pictures gave my brain a break while still getting into a story and flexing the proper muscles. Didn’t harm my ability to read and if anything encouraged me to read more."
4729,irwkon,6,"While I agree with this, I would like to state that I do not feel the same way about all the following books in the series. They progressively get more absurd, and while they all have their moments and should be read at some point or another, I would probably also sort them under too intense. Since it has been a while I'm not exactly sure which book had which parts, but I feel like I got the most out of the first two books."
4730,irwkon,6,"Oof, this ressonates with me. I'm in college and after spending the day reading heavy textbooks I usually don't have the brainpower to read a thoughful book with heavy plot, so I'm leaning towards comics or YA/childrens books, and lemme tell ya, they're a godsend because it allows my brain to shut down for a few minutes while also bringing me immense joy with the story"
4731,irwkon,3,This recommendation should always come with the asterisk that Orson Scott Card is a garbage human being and by supporting his works you are supporting his ability to continue to spread his bad ideas that are actively harmful towards people.
4732,irwkon,3,This recommendation should always come with the asterisk that Orson Scott Card is a garbage human being and by supporting his works you are supporting his ability to continue to spread his bad ideas that are actively harmful towards people.
4733,irwkon,3,"completely agree with this selection!

Kindred by Octavia Butler is a great book too, and I recommend Jackie French's books as well."
4734,irwkon,39,I agree with Percy Jackson. It’s the series that really made me love reading as a kid. The writing style is simple to follow. You’ll love Riordan’s humor.
4735,irwkon,5,"Every suggestion I’ve read is worth picking up, but Hitchhikers Guide is phenomenal imho and I think it’s written fairly simply but at the same time it’s hilarious and one of my all time faves"
4736,irwkon,4,Discworld would be good I think
4737,irwkon,3,Can I get some details on this? Loved the Ender series(s) but have no real background on Card as a human.
4738,irwkon,5,"I read 100 books a year on my goodreads challenge (super behind this year tho, might not make it!!!) and I give up on plenty of books. I was always “the hermione” who was constantly reading. There’s a weird stigma around not finishing a book that I think deters people from being “readers.”"
4739,irwkon,3,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/2013/10/enders-game/amp

That's one of the first things that came up on Google. There are lots of other things written about his homophobia and racism."
4740,irwkon,3,"I had to read the Chronicles of Narnia in third grade. I would say for that reason, it’s a good beginner book."
4741,irwkon,3,Fight club...Chuck Palahnuik
4742,irwkon,4,"The Arc of a Scythe series has been a super entertaining &amp; relatively simple read for me, if you’re into science fiction/dystopian/utopian/adventure type of books. I’m bad at describing books clearly but suffice it to say it’s a great series"
4743,irwkon,3,"Hitchhikers guide, Howls moving Castle and Fahrenheit are wonderful and are easy enough reads. Howls is a book I reread every year because of how FUN it is"
4744,irwkon,3,Well fuck me that's disappointing. Thanks a bunch.
4745,irwkon,3,I've read Something Wicked This Way Comes 4 or 5 times. The first exposure was when my 3rd grade teacher read it aloud. This would be a good pick. It's a easy read but not simplistic.
4746,irwkon,4,"Seconding this—all of her books are just fun, start to finish"
4747,irwkon,6,"Adding to this, A Series of Unfortunate Events is fantastic in book form. The Netflix show is good but has a lot of spoilers if you aren’t into those beforehand."
4748,irwkon,18,I second Harry Potter. Then the hunger games.
4749,irwkon,5,Right? After a brick wall of highly technical -know this information or else- text I just wanted pretty pictures and jokes!
4750,irwkon,18,I’m 32 and am reading through HP for the first time now. Started book 1 in April with the quarantine. I’m currently on 7. I had to force myself to take breaks between books become I become obsessed while reading them. It’s the only thing I want to do/read/think about. It’s been an awesome journey though!!
4751,irwkon,3,Zoo is amazing. Patterson can be a little stale - often churning out similar stories - but Zoo is a great stand alone read
4752,irwkon,3,"Yup. I honestly wouldn't recommend alot of the books you have here. Blade runner might be fun, but to read for fun you actually need to have fun reading. Farenheit 451 has an interesting premise, so does 1984, but it gets really nitty gritty and kind of academic at times. Not saying people can't enjoy reading the classics that you hear about like Jane Eyre or whatever, but if you're just starting then read something that you can get turn your brain off for and get lost in. If you're thinking too hard then its not fun. At least until you get more into the hobby"
4753,irwkon,3,I also agree on this! Easy read yet an amazing   story that just pulls you right into the world.
4754,irwkon,4,I loved his books (I still do). Very easy for a beginner and plenty of sass as well.
4755,irxfmw,3,Im also looking for some
4756,irxfmw,4,"This isn’t as specific as you’d like, but I really really enjoy reading anything about the Apollo missions or any of that early space flight. I can’t think of anything particularly introductory, but I bet if you search around more in that more specific context you can find something you’re looking for."
4757,irxfmw,7,"Astrophysics for People in A Hurry - Neil Degrasse Tyson

A great starting point for answering the fundamental questions about the universe. 

A Man on The Moon - Andrew Chaikin 

Discusses in great detail all of the Apollo Missions

The Case for Mars - Richard Wagner and Robert Zubrin 

Discusses the current scientific implementations that could get us to mars today. It gets to be a bit much with the “our plan is THE plan” style of writing but these guys really understand what they’re talking about. 

Also fiction but The Martian - Andy Weir 

For a good story with a lot of actual science."
4758,irxfmw,3,Packing for Mars by Mary Roach is a really good book.
4759,irxfmw,3,Came here to suggest The Martian as well. The author really did his homework to make sure the science was accurate. Impressive stuff.
4760,irxfmw,3,Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin
4761,irxfmw,3,"Rendezvous with Rama, 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C Clarke.

Read these two on last April and I was blown away."
4762,irxfmw,3,LOVE both the Martian and Astrophysics for People in a Hurry! And I think that really any Neil deGrasse Tyson book would fit into this category.
4763,irxfmw,3,"It’s the first novel in a trilogy and it’s an easy read; the only downside is there is some large vocabulary, but I don’t read that often and it was easy for me to understand. The imagery is fantastic in his writing, and his second book is great so far"
4764,iryt5c,8,Small Gods by Terry Pratchett.
4765,iryt5c,12,Check out Gaiman's sandman graphic novels. It is as good as it gets.
4766,iryt5c,6,"Dresden Files by Jim Butcher

Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne"
4767,iryt5c,3,"Definitely recommend Dresden Files. Personally, I didn't get on too well with the Iron Druid Chronicles."
4768,iryt5c,3,"YA, but i enjoyed the series anyway. 
Michael Scott
The Alchemyst: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel"
4769,iryt5c,4,"Also YA, but any of Rick Riordan's books."
4770,iryt5c,5,Ben Aaronovitch's Rivers of London series is definitely worth a try.
4771,iryt5c,4,"Seconded, he also read the first 3 for audible, which is a very good listen if you have 10 hours and want a different kind of sound track."
4772,iryt5c,3,"The Library at Mt. Char is simply an amazing book that incorporates the same type of godlike, genre bending mythology. Can’t recommend enough for American God fans."
4773,iryt5c,4,"I haven't read it myself yet, but Gaiman also wrote *Anansi Boys* which to my understanding takes place in the same universe as American Gods."
4774,iryt5c,3,"I bet you would like ""Neverwhere"" by Gaiman. A whole world of mythology under the streets of London. Another personal Gaiman favourite is ""The lake at the end of the lane""."
4775,iryt5c,3,"Yep, it's focussed on Fat Charlie and Spider Nancy, the twin sons of an incarnation of the Anansi who appears in American Gods."
4776,iryt5c,3,"Fourth-ed(?) Fantastic series, both in story and artwork"
4777,is33s0,3,"I suppose you mean her historical romances, not her detective fiction!

Something close in tone, but rather shorter and fluffier are the Regency  \[and other time periods as well\] Romances of MC Beaton, and I believe she wrote tons of them \[maybe fifty or more!\] At first glance , you might think they are a bit Mills and Boon, but no, they are wickedly funny with a satirical edge that stops them from being too fluffy. I love them, I can read one in an evening and it's the perfect antidote to the Covid world. I have an idea some of them are out of print now - you could get them used on Amazon /kindle or via your library. 

Some of her series are: The Poor Relations series, the Travelling Matchmaker series, the Regency series etc etc.

.\*..be careful not to order her detective stories by mistake - she wrote tons of those too -  ie the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth series"
4778,is33s0,6,"Georgette Heyer's books are so wonderful! I've read over 100 traditional regencies chasing that high, but most just aren't as good. 

Of her imitators, my very favorite is Joan Smith. She writes very funny books that are still satisfying emotionally. My personal favorites are Imprudent Lady, Escapade, Aunt Sophie's Diamonds, Bath Scandal, A Country Wooing, Cousin Cecilia, The Barefoot Baroness, and Winter Wedding.

I also really like Fallen Angel by Charlotte Louise Dolan, Miss Lockharte's Letters by Barbara Metzger, Brighton Road by Susan Carroll, and A Curious Courting by Laura Matthews.

4779,is33s0,3,I think this is a great recommendation! Nine Coaches Waiting for example has a very Heyer-esque love interest.
4780,is33s0,3,"They’re not Regency, but early 1900s, and they have something of the Georgette Heyer tone: try books by Berta Ruck, such as {Miss Million’s Maid} , {{His Official Fiancée}} ."

The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. It is light, short and sweet. 

All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot is so great. I love reading about his adventures being a large animal vet in the 1930s in the Yorkshire Dales. It’s such a pleasant escape. All the village people and farmers are described so well. I read this one every few years."

My Spirit Journey by The Dalai Lama. This is a great autobiography on spiritual transformation and universal questions. 

The Heart of the Buddha’s Teachings by Thich Nhat Hanh. This is a fun read that goes over the core teachings of Buddhism. 


On another note, have you looked into Taoism? The philosophy’s principles are quite similar to that of Buddhism. If you’re ever interested I’d recommend reading the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu. It’s a wonderful book that can be read with both light and deep meanings."

4809,isb0pb,7,"Try some **Charles de Lint**, the Canadian writer who coined the term 'urban fantasy.'  Mind you, although his themes are often dark (as well as many of his characters), he rarely resorts to the bleak, overly vio!ent, blood-spatter-and-body-parts that decorate so much American urban fantasy.

Instead, he weaves Celtic (Fae) myths and First Nations lore - especially that of the tricksters, the shapeshifters - into something quite magical. In his city of Newford, peopled with the young, the creative, the disaffected, the homeless, there are other worlds that exist alongside our own. Living in Newford means that you may encounter a supernatural being, a time loop, or another dimension around the next corner of your basic Monday. 

There's no established reading order, although a good introduction is **Dreams Underfoot**, his first set of Newford stories. But it's not a series as much as it's an alternate universe, so you can start anywhere. As you can see from this list on Goodreads, there are many books, all standalones, allthough you'll often find that some characters overlap. And he's still writing that world! so this list may not include all of Newford.

For explaining bipolar (or again an diagnosis), my favorite work book is called: Wishing Wellness.

&gt;""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. 
&gt; 
&gt;The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. 
&gt; 
&gt;The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. 
&gt; 
&gt;The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.""

*Anno Dracula* by Kim Newman

*Southern Vampire Series* (Sookie Stackhouse) by Charlaine Harris (basis for the show, True Blood. I liked the books better but they are a not quite as “high brow” maybe) 

For a hilarious series, try the Queen of the Undead series by Mary Janice Davidson. Love this one. 

It’s been a while since I have read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K Hamilton. The first few are really good, then they become soft porn around book 7 or so.

If you like vampire erotica, Poppy Z Brite is a good author in those veins lol

&gt;Fledgling, Octavia Butler's new novel after a seven year break, is the story of an apparently young, amnesiac girl whose alarmingly inhuman needs and abilities lead her to a startling conclusion: She is in fact a genetically modified, 53-year-old vampire. Forced to discover what she can about her stolen former life, she must at the same time learn who wanted - and still wants - to destroy her and those she cares for and how she can save herself. Fledgling is a captivating novel that tests the limits of ""otherness"" and questions what it means to be truly human.

Not sure it really fits the fall mood (I just have always started my read throughs in the fall so it correlates for me), but The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan (and the last three books by Brandon Sanderson) is a great series. Really long, though. 15 books (with the prequel). Michael Kramer and Kate Reading to an amazing job with this one.

Otherwise I’ve always enjoyed reading the Harry Potter series starting in the fall. It’s probably just nostalgic for me, but fall always gets me in the mood to revisit those."

4926,iscb8r,6,"I was gonna recommend a book. I even had a full explanation typed up. But that book wouldn’t quite help. Instead, I want to give to pieces of advice that helped me through a disturbingly similar experience to yours.

Talk, often, with people who don’t talk much about God. These are people who don’t think about it often enough for it to bother them. That’s the solution. If you don’t think about the topic, those lessons won’t come to the top of your mind. Get used to not calling them up.

But at the same time, don’t stop thinking about it completely. When you’re on your own, and when you’re feeling like it, and at no other time, think on it all. Think about what makes sense to you, what gives you comfort, how you can feel value without that particular measuring stick. Don’t get mad at the people who do believe- that’s a quick path to easy but unfulfilling answers. 

And if you ever want to know what that book was, let me know. It’s not that important in comparison to the other stuff I’ve said, but I liked it, and I think you would, later."
4927,iscb8r,12,"Age of Reason by Thomas Paine

The Portable Atheist by Christopher Hitchens (it's not as pretentious as it sounds) and if you're not familiar with him, certainly check out his videos and essays.

4928,iscb8r,10,"I don’t have a book title but I can suggest a path to mental salvation.

^(By: Richard Dawkins | 374 pages | Published: 2006 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, religion, science, philosophy, nonfiction | )[^(Search ""The God Delusion"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The God Delusion&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;A preeminent scientist - and the world's most prominent atheist - asserts the irrationality of belief in God, and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11.
&gt;
&gt;With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament, to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.
&gt;
&gt;The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.

4934,iscb8r,7,"Everyday is an Atheist Holiday by Penn Jillette. Really, any of his books. God, No! is another one. He honest in his books and he comes from a good place. He plays an asshole but really he’s a big softy. I got to meet him in real life and I started crying. He gave me a hug and said it was ok. I also recommend listening to his podcast: Penn’s Sunday School. He talks about atheism and goes into the morality. He’s the one who convinced that it’s ok to tell others you are an atheist and that’s there’s no shame in it."
4935,iscb8r,6,"Huh, okay, i literally just wrote this for a different recommendation yesterday:  

Terry Pratchett's novel ""Nation"" is a celebration of atheism and secular humanism.

The  story is about Mau, a boy from a small island in the south pacific in  the 1800s, who survives a tidal wave on the way home from a manhood ritual only to find when he reaches home that his entire village has  been wiped out by the wave. The first survivor he finds is a young British girl, herself the sole survivor of a shipwreck. And as they learn to communicate and understand each other and try to survive alone,  and then as other survivors from other islands start to arrive, Mau finds himself increasingly in conflict with the traditions and beliefs  of his people that, at best, serve little purpose in his survival-driven existence, and, at worst, are superstitious lies that failed the ones he loved when the wave came  and killed them all.

That sounds  grim, i know, but it's actually a light-hearted Robinson Crusoe style castaway comedy adventure with a little bit of society building thrown in. And while Mau's rejection of religion plays a large part, it's much more about what he decides to live his life for instead - himself, and the people around him, and the truth of the world. At its heart it's about how nonbelief can be more than just... not believing in something,  but can be a choice and a calling to strive for the betterment of the  living world of the here and now."
4936,iscb8r,10,"You should read yuval Noah harari's sapiens. It's not about religion, it's about humans. It doesn't say that it's okay to not believe but it gives a very good perspective on religions which might help you realize by yourself that it's okay.

4937,iscb8r,4,"Piggybacking on this comment about Greek Myths. I found Mythos by Stephen Fry excellent for his retelling of the myths. (Pro-tip - the audio book is great).

4938,iscb8r,3,"I encourage you to tread carefully here. When I lost my faith and started looking for answers and reasons why it's ok to not believe in God, I became very spiteful. Going through this may very well define the next few years of your life, as the sundering of a world view has far reaching affects. While the ""new atheists"" as they were known back in the day, or ""the four horsemen,"" do have widely disseminated and enjoyable reads, I think only Daniel Dennet's musings on the subject of God ever really broached much depth. After all, he is a philosopher. Dawkins is a brilliant biologist but perennially scornful. Harris is also brilliant, but often dismissive and demeaning. And good ole Hitch was by trade an opinion writer and polemicist, so he was never one to pull punches. 

Now, all four of them have worthwhile things to say, to be sure, but, at least for me (and many others who went the same route) it was hard to stay abreast of their contempt and not be influenced by it. 

Jordan Peterson has some pretty interesting things to say on the subject of God and religion and it's historical and metaphorical meanings. You might find some solace or refreshing air there."
4939,iscb8r,3,"Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse.
In this book the protagonist is in pursuance of enlightenment and struggles often with disbelief, but in the end every part of his life was a necessary experience.
This book is focused on Buddhism and its idea of belief, but it was nonetheless very helpful to get perspective on ""believing"" in general (I'm Christian myself).
This book is not an argument on why you should belief, neither on why you should be an atheist. Just a example of man's realtionship to spirituality and its struggles."

&gt;Once a year, scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a three-day camping trip; a tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story and a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intruder -- shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry -- stumbles upon their campsite, Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. An inexplicable horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival that will pit the troop against the elements, the infected ... and one another.

&gt;The story of two college friends on a wilderness canoe trip—of a friendship tested by fire, white water, and violence
&gt;
&gt;Wynn and Jack have been best friends since freshman orientation, bonded by their shared love of mountains, books, and fishing. Wynn is a gentle giant, a Vermont kid never happier than when his feet are in the water. Jack is more rugged, raised on a ranch in Colorado where sleeping under the stars and cooking on a fire came as naturally to him as breathing. 
&gt;
&gt;When they decide to canoe the Maskwa River in northern Canada, they anticipate long days of leisurely paddling and picking blueberries, and nights of stargazing and reading paperback Westerns. But a wildfire making its way across the forest adds unexpected urgency to the journey. 
&gt;
&gt;When they hear a man and woman arguing on the fog-shrouded riverbank and decide to warn them about the fire, their search for the pair turns up nothing and no one. But: The next day a man appears on the river, paddling alone. Is this the man they heard? And, if he is, where is the woman?

4952,jumcck,3,"I am super fascinated by a nonfiction book called *Goodbye Things*. It’s written by this guy who is kind of a shut-in, who one day gets inspired by Marie Kondo and decides to take her advice to the extreme and get rid of almost everything he owns—even the stuff that he adores, like his vintage camera collection, the loss of which he mentions repeatedly. The entire book is a rumination on how his decision has changed his life. It’s a very wistful book, but there’s also something appealing and dreamy about the spartan, monastic life he leads.

I really like “hygge” books about living alone and simply. Marjorie Hillis wrote a number of such books for single women; my favorite of hers is a 1937 book called *Orchids on Your Budget* (sometimes reprinted as *Bubbly on Your Budget*). In a similar vein, I love the 1930 book *French Cooking in 10 Minutes* by Edouard de Pomiane, which is probably the book I have gifted most often, and maybe my all-time favorite book.

These are charming, cozy reads, with a very specific undercurrent of melancholy and practical “making do” that might really appeal to you."

The Prince and the Program

(The Mordred Saga #1)

by Aldous Mercer (Goodreads Author)


Mordred Pendragon, the Bastard Prince, has done a Bad Thing—again. Exiled to Canada for seven years, he has to find a job to pay his bills. For reasons he refuses to reveal, Mordred decides “Software Engineer” has a nice ring to it. And though experience with “killing the Once and Future King, my father” and “that time in feudal Japan” makes for a poor résumé, he is hired by a small tech startup in Toronto.

In the midst of dealing with a crippling caffeine addiction and learning C++, Mordred thinks he has finally found someone to anchor him to the world of the living: Alan, the company’s offsite lead developer. Except that Alan might not be a ""living"" entity at all—he may, in fact, be the world's first strong AI. Or a demon that mistook a Windows install for the highway to Hell. Or, just maybe, the ghost of Alan Turing, currently inhabiting a laptop.

Mordred's attempts to figure out his love life are hampered by constant interference from the Inquisitors of the Securitates Arcanarum, corporate espionage, real espionage, a sysadmin bent on enslaving the world, and Marketing's demands that Mordred ship software to the Russian Federation. Then Alan gets himself kidnapped. To save him, Mordred must ally himself with the company’s CEO, who will stop at nothing to rescue her lead developer so he can get back to work. But the Prince doesn’t just want to rescue Alan, he wants a Happily Ever After—and he will travel beyond Death itself to get one.

Too bad Alan is perfectly happy as a computer."

&gt;Every schoolchild learns about the mutually beneficial dance of honeybees and flowers: The bee collects nectar and pollen to make honey and, in the process, spreads the flowers’ genes far and wide. In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind’s most basic yearnings. And just as we’ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?

5004,jutue9,113,"I'd recommend The Mysterious Benedict Society, especially for your preteens! It's not a murder mystery –– the four main characters are child geniuses recruited to go undercover and figure out what's really going on at this sinister boarding school. But it has the same suspense, memorable/eccentric characters with a fun dynamic, humor, and heart as Knives Out. And its full of puzzles you try to solve along with the characters, and the same kinds of mind blowing finally-connecting-the-dots moments you get in a good murder mystery."
5005,jutue9,6,"My local Indy bookstore said the Charlotte Holmes YA series is quite good. It uses some of the plot points from Sherlock Holmes with a modern character.  A couple of female friends liked the Aurora Tea Garden mysteries. They thought the books were better than the Hallmark Series (although it's not bad IMHO). 

Jeffrey Deaver's Bone Collector series seems good. I have read more of his short stories, but they seem to not be terrible on violence. Regarding Christie, the And Then They Were None is a clever often duplicated plot. The Hercule Poirot Short Story Collection is a good collection. The Incredible Theft is a good long short story if your kids wanted a sample."
5006,jutue9,103,"I haven't seen Knives Out, but I did fall in love with Christie's books as a teenager. If there's some wiggle room on Christie, I recommend starting with And Then There Were None - 10 people are invited to a remote island under false pretenses, and they start dying one by one in a manner predicted by the poem hanging in their rooms.

Murder on the Orient Express is the other book I'd recommend starting with, but I think it's a little slower to hook the reader than ATTWN."
5007,jutue9,275,"Maybe Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz? But honestly I think Christie is better than Horowitz. Christie’s “And Then There Were None” is iconic and very easy to read — whereas her “Crooked House” is part of the inspiration for Knives Out.

If you liked the family/inheritance/clue-seeking aspect, maybe {{Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close}}."

&gt;A Cinderella story with deadly stakes and thrilling twists, perfect for fans of One of Us is Lying and Knives Out. 
&gt;
&gt;Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why--or even who Tobias Hawthorne is. To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, where every room bears the old man's touch--and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. 
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions. Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a con-woman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.

5019,jutue9,6,Magpie Murders and Moonflower murders are excellent.
5020,jutue9,35,"I’d second this. It’s not as funny as Knives Out, but it’s the best recently written mystery story I’ve come across and the whole plot dynamic is brilliant."
5021,jutue9,80,"I agree that Horowitz is the closest thing to a modern day Christie, though his stories are just not as good IMHO. I think one of the problems is that Christie used up every simple twist and plot device, so now authors have to come up with incredibly elaborate plots just to seem fresh."
5022,jutue9,10,"Ten Little Indians/And Then There Were None is probably the best book written by Christie, and I think the central ideas of the book  - question of justice, of crimes which are not punishable in the strict sense by the law, very slasher-y series of murders, growing tension and penetrating mistrust - were actually *too ahead* of the time the book was published. It also has two great film adaptations - recent BBC three-part miniseries and 1987 Soviet adaptation Десят негритять.

Another good recommendation is *Eternal Night -* very non-standard Christie book, written from the perspective of a young male who is not a detective, but a central character of the book. It has a semblance of murder mystery, but the dominant tone is one of melancholy and even thriller in later parts.

Two Christie novels I also must absolutely recommend are The Murder on Orient Express - which differs from the typical detective novel formula by having the plot take place in a very specific environment with a colorful cast of characters, and featuring a strong moral dilemma - and Death On Nile, which is a classic Christie novel done by-the-book, but beautifully writen and with a very clever plot."
5023,jutue9,40,"Even Christie ""being old"", I'd recommend her books. Her language is not old at all, and the flow of their books it's thrilling. Sherlock Holmes also its always a good choice. I've read Christie and Doyle with 13/14 years, and loved them (I'm 18 now)."
5024,jutue9,15,"For some YA murder mysteries, I’d recommend:
- Karen M. McManus’ “Two Can Keep a Secret” and “One Of Us Is Lying,” I think she has a few others as well
- Lamar Giles’ “Fake ID” or “Spin”
- Maureen Johnson’s “Truly Devious” trilogy
- April Henry also writes suspense/mystery novels

If they haven’t read “The Westing Game” by Ellen Raskin, definitely that one! It’s such a good mystery, and involves an inheritance as well."
5025,jutue9,11,"And Then There Were None by Christie is the closest comparison in my opinion. The Inheritance Games by Jennifer Lynn Barnes is being compared to Knives Out constantly. Another option is Truly Devious by Maureen Johnson. This has a teenage sleuth that solves a mystery at school. It has kind of the big, spooky house and family scandal vibes that Knives Out had. It’s also a series."
5026,jutue9,16,The Hunting Party and The Guest List both by Lucy Foley are excellent!
5027,jutue9,8,"I used to read every Hercule Poirot book mom had in her library when I was younger. I never thought of Agatha Christie books as old, I guess.  Curtain was bittersweet. Murder on the Orient Express was a revelation for me at that age. That was then tho, things in entertainment are a lot more complex now. Kids are exposed to a very different media now. Following the post! I loved the movie as well and been wondering about this very question!"
5028,jutue9,291,"The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. Very similar feel to knives out. Guy dies, bunch of people are invited to his will reading. Will says one of them is the killer and the person who solves it gets the money. Written for middle grade reader."
5029,jutue9,26,"Bit of a strange question but is ""And Then There Were None"" scary?"
5030,jutue9,6,"Really? I found them hard to follow along with honestly, as much hype as I've heard that I wanted to try them out. But different styles for different folks"
5031,jutue9,13,"YES YES YES! I adored these books when I was around their age. The writing is so witty and clever, the characters are memorable, and it's an all-around wonderful time. Could not recommend enough!"
5032,jutue9,8,"Ten by Gretchen McNeil

An Unwanted Guest by Shari Lapena

The Guest List by Lucy Foley

The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley

They All Fall Down by Rachel Howzell Hall

The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin"
5033,jutue9,5,Seconded!
5034,jutue9,3,The Guest List and The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley
5035,jutue9,7,Which books did you read of Christie’s that you couldn’t follow? Sorry you didn’t like them- maybe try some other ones!
5036,jutue9,3,"I’m not sure this is necessarily better, but as a Christie-phile, I’ve loved John Dickson Carr, too. It’s the same era of language, so might still be hard to hook teenagers on (though I fell in love with Christie in ninth grade!), but I find his stuff to be more cinematic. It’s a bit more exciting and frequently has cliff hangers at the end of chapters. More adventurous and less pensive than Christie is."
5037,jutue9,3,I think it was Six Against the Yard and Murder on the Orient Express. I couldn't get into them 😅 and I'm 27. So must be a preferred writing style
5038,jutue9,41,"Not OP but depends on your scare tolerance! I'd say more creepy than anything else? I have a very low scare tolerance (like I can't do gore or horror at all), and found ATTWN creepy at worst, and kind of thrilling throughout."
5039,jutue9,8,This is a strong recommendation. I agree.
5040,jutue9,24,"DISAGREE. I love mysteries but found this one too self-indulgent and clever for me. No spoilers, but I didn't like the ending. It does have the ""Knives Out"" feel of a family murder, but I didn't find it charming like the movie."
5041,jutue9,18,This is the one. I loved this book.
5042,jutue9,7,"I reckon I'll give it a go then. I do enjoy creepy elements to a story, but too much and I struggle to read on! Especially as I mostly read before bed."
5043,jutue9,55,Absolutely adored this book when I was younger. I can't remember anything about it except that it was awesome.
5044,jutue9,9,"I finished Murder on the Orient Express not too long ago and was shocked to find out that it was written in the 30s. It didn't feel very old at all! Maybe if they have Christie a try they'd like it! Sorry, I know that isn't what you asked for, but just throwing it out there haha"
5045,jutue9,6,Others have said it but I want to emphasize the Westing Game. Written specifically for preteen audiences and has the same sort of parlor mystery feel as Knives Out. Very good book.
5046,jutue9,9,"I read mostly before bed too! Never had any ""sleep with the lights on"" moments, only a couple minutes of ""oo spooky"" before sleeping. Hope you enjoy, that's one of my favourites of hers!"
5047,jutue9,13,"I’m obsessed with any book written by Ruth Ware. She’s a British psycho thrill/ murder mystery writer. The first book of hers I read was In a Dark, Dark Wood. I absolutely flew through it. All of her books have perfect unexpected twists in them. They never fail to keep me on the edge of my seat."
5048,jutue9,7,Absolutely. &gt;!The ending was out of nowhere and felt super odd tonally.!&lt;
5049,jutue9,8,Came here to commemt this
5050,jutue9,16,"Yes! My first thought too. Loved this book as a kid, re-read it sometime in the last few years and it totally holds up."
5051,jutue9,6,This is perfect! This book is so underrated.
5052,jutue9,5,yes!! i read those books when i was a kid and absolutely loved them. mysterious benedict society is so good
5053,jutue9,6,A series of unfortunate events!
5054,jutue9,11,"Oh, one of my absolute favorite books when I was younger.  I read it a few times, just loving to mull over the clues and how it all came together!"
5055,jutue9,5,"I suggest “The Inheritance Games” by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. Not a overly long or challenging read, but just fun like Knives Out. Similar plot, but no murder mystery. It’s a part of the Barnes &amp; Nobles YA book club too!"
5056,jutue9,15,"&gt; Six Against the Yard

I've read a lot of Christie and never heard of this--it seems it's not a Christie book! I'm not sure how Christie's name got attached to it, but it's a collection of stories by other writers [1] in the 30s with a commentary by a Scotland Yard detective on how to solve the cases. 

Murder on the Orient Express is definitely hers, though, and if you couldn't follow it, maybe Christie isn't your cup of arsenic. 

[1] Margery Allingham, Anthony Berkeley, Freeman Willis Croft, Father Knox, Dorothy L. Sayers and Russell Thorndike"
5057,jutue9,3,I just replied the same thing!  Totally agree!
5058,jutue9,3,"Oh okay! The version i had of Six Against The Yard had her name in bold so I assume it was hers. 

But yeah I could give her another shot, maybe Murder on the Orient Express wasn't the book for me. I'm the same way with Stephen King though, some I can't follow while others I love to bits so maybe it'll just take some hits and misses"
5059,jutue9,16,"I cannot recommend enough the Flavia de Luce series by Alan Bradley. The main character is a spunky, headstrong  11 year old who loves chemistry, death, riding her bike, being nosey and solving crimes in 1950s England. Super cozy vibes, great quirky characters and awesome mysteries along with an interesting backstory that even adults will love. 

I recommend you start with the first novel, as they should be read in order for continuity : The sweetness at the bottom of the pie."
5060,jutue9,11,"That's fair: this book isn't charming or warm, but it's clever.&gt;!The element where you learn a little  more about the other characters with every reboot appealed to me. And it reminded me of a Black Mirror episode.!&lt;"
5061,jutue9,3,"I'd say ""Confessions of a Teenage Murder Suspect."" It's got mystery vibes and is marketed for teens so definitely appropriate."
5062,jutue9,6,"If you don't want to try Orient Express again, you might want to try her first one, The Mysterious Affair at Styles or her other classic, And Then There Were None. There are very few of her books that are outright bad (in my opinion The Big Four and Black Coffee are bad, and most people seem to dislike The Clocks), so you can try any others and see what you think. 

Happy reading!"
5063,jutue9,4,I recently read this and it's really good! It's what came into my mind when I saw this request. Good characters and a fun mystery.
5064,jutue9,4,"I loved this too- I felt like it was a mash up of The Westing Game and Rebecca (there are clear homages to Rebecca throughout). So much fun. And i think I mentally cast actors/faces from Knives Out into various adults. 

I want to keep gushing, but it was really satisfying."
5065,jutue9,3,The Word Is Murder by Anthony Horowitz
5066,jutue9,7,Alan Bradly’s Flavia de Luce series is amazing for both young and adult readers.
5067,jutue9,4,"I read this and thought it was ok. I definitely found myself just flipping through pages to find something interesting as I got bored. I finished it, but wasn't a favorite. 

I do recommend The Westing Game though. And the Maureen Johnson series, Truly Devious."
5068,jutue9,3,bookmarted The Mysterious Benedict Society
5069,jutue9,3,The “truly devious” series by Maureen Johnson was amazing! The first book I like couldn’t put it down and had to wait for the second two. But the mystery and the way it unfolds was so so good. Plus it’s stars teenagers around early high school so hopefully your kiddos enjoy it!
5070,jutue9,7,"In a similar vein: does anyone have any suggestions for humorous mysteries, like the movies Murder by Death and Clue?"
5071,jutue9,3,I read The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie at that age and loved it. Great mystery and one of the best written female protagonists ever.
5072,jutue9,3,"I loved Mary Higgins Clark as a teen. Going back and rereading some of her books, they obviously take place in the 90s or early 00s, but the plots still hold up."
5073,jutue9,6,"Love this book growing up.  After watching Knives Out I had to google for a bit to actually find the name of the book, might re-read it for nostalgia."
5074,jutue9,3,"My (30F) favorite Agatha Christie’s which don’t feel too old to me at all but then I’ve always been an Anglophile: Crooked House, Murder on the Links, Cards on the Table, Peril at End House, After the Funeral. I consider Knives Out a diluted Agatha Christie. The recent Murder on the Orient Express movie starring Michelle Pfeiffer was AMAZING, highly recommend."
5075,jutue9,3,"Agree with you. Liked it, didn’t love it. I think my problem was I read it on a kindle and I broke it up into too many small segments of reading. I feel like you need to stay very in tune with this story and be able to flip back and forth easily to pick up on everything."
5076,jutue9,3,"Agree with you, not my favorite ending to a book but I think it was pretty gripping and the most fitting for what the OP asked for"
5077,jutue9,4,"I second the recommendation of Lucy Foley's The Guest List, I specifically thought of Knives Out when I read it, and she's been compared to a modern Agatha Christie in reviews."
5078,jutue9,3,"It's not funny like Knives Out but I enjoyed ""One of Us is Lying."" It's a YA murder mystery that tackles some modern social problems as well."
5079,jutue9,7,In 6th grade I picked it for my English book to read and write a paper on. I never finished it because I got to freaked out. I'm sure that has more to do with my age but I'm 30 now and still to chicken to read it becauss I remember I was scared.
5080,jutue9,3,"I recently enjoyed ""One of Us is Lying"", but I didn't consider it YA at the time.  A lot of dark stuff."
5081,jutue9,3,We have always lived in the castle by Shirley jackson
5082,jutue9,8,Nah not really. Not particularly scary at all—iirc all deaths occur “off screen” fwiw
5083,jutue9,3,Ditto. I read The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as a 14 tear old and was floored. Was hooked on mysteries ever since.
5084,jutue9,7,"Quick note since these are suggestions for kids. I’ve read four or five of Christie’s earlier works and there is definitely some casual racism (in at least one they reference dressing in black face) and there’s also some casual anti-Semitism. I’m not sure if someone who isn’t Jewish would even pick up on the anti-Semitism, but it’s there. Unfortunately, I think the racist and anti-Semitic moments in her books are reflections of the time period in which they were written. 

That being said, her stories are really enjoyable."
5085,jutue9,3,"They would like 39 Clues, for sure. It starts with a grandmother's funeral, where a kind of scavenger hunt across the world begins. There are a ton of old family feuds, near death scenes, and a crap ton of sarcasm."
5086,jutue9,4,"Oh man, reading that title brought on a HUGE rush of nostalgia...

Also made me think of ""the egypt game"" that I read at about the same time.

Totally different type of book, but man were they good."
5087,jutue9,3,"Def not. Suspenseful, but not scary. A world of a difference. But the literary craft allows the reader to enjoy the english, thus reducing stress, and walk side by side with suspense."
5088,jutue9,3,"i am just listening to 'And then they were none' by AC reda by Dan Stevens

Brilliant :)"
5089,jutue9,6,"I mean this book is from 1978 and Agatha Christie was writing until 1976. So might as well read Agatha Christie? If this isn’t dated, neither is she, and Christie is wonderful (and appropriate to beginning readers)."
5090,jutue9,4,Sounds like the perfect excuse for a reread! And it’s so short that it could be read in one sitting!

The Shell Seekers is about a mother with a painting and her family dynamics around what to do with it. Rosamunde Pilcher generally is a good bet for books about women. 

The Widows of Malabar Hill is about a woman lawyer in Bombay in the 20s; she gets involved in a case with a group of women who aren’t allowed to talk to men directly. There’s also a sequel, The Satapur Moonstone. 

America’s First Daughter and My Dear Hamilton are both historical fiction about the Founding Fathers from a woman’s POV and I found them incredibly engaging.

The Good House is about an older woman who is an alcoholic. It isn’t sad- I thought it was laugh out loud funny at points. Highly recommend the audio. 

The Island of Sea Women is about Korean women divers, and is super interesting. Most of Lisa See’s books are about women with multifaceted stories that aren’t just about the men in their life.

Or the baroque cycle by Stephenson.  Or Cryptonomicon by Stephenson. 

I guess anything by Neal would be good, but those in particular are good."
5125,juxho0,5,"So, that genre is usually called 'hard science fiction', if you want to look for more on your own.

I recommend SevenEves by Neal Stephenson."

*2001: A Space Odyssey* by Arthur C. Clarke. The book and the Kubrick film were written in parallel, so the book is an excellent companion to the film. What Kubrick couldn’t or wouldn’t explain, Clarke does.

*The Three-Body Problem* by Cixin Liu. 

*The Andromeda Strain* by Michael Crichton. Adapted to film twice, ignore the more recent adaptation. Few hard science fiction novels are about biology instead of physics, but this one is.

5132,jv4z7a,4,“The Elegance of the Hedgehog” by Muriel Barbery.  It’s about deeper thoughts in everyday experiences. I loved it.
5133,jv4z7a,8,"Gilead by Marilynne Robinson

A beautiful book written in a form of a long letter by an old priest addressed to his young son. It is like a medley of his life experience, advice, and just generally rambling about things he wanted to share with his son when he grows up but wouldn't be able to because of a fatal heart condition.

It is all about appreciating the little things in life. It exactly feels like a wise old grandpa telling you about life."
5134,jv4z7a,3,"He may enjoy Kurt Vonnegut. I would suggest starting with Sirens of Titan or God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, but most of his books have a similar message. While the characters aren't intrinsically happy, the books show how absurd the world can be, and how it is best to just enjoy while you can."
5135,jv4z7a,3,"Might not help find happiness but all of Dostoevsky’s major works are definetly thought provoking and life changing 

I also very much enjoy Henry David Thoreau’s work he has written philosophy and poetry aswell."
5136,jv4z7a,3,"I would suggest [Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52036.Siddhartha). It really shows some aspect of life and a way of thinking that makes you understand the simple joys in the moment , the beauty of touch observing , listening and many more wonders of life in a very unique way."

5147,jv70pk,211,"I'll suggest some extremely readable non-fiction!

Educated by Tara Westover. non fiction, auto biography. Really well written.

The Orchid Thief- Susan Orlean. A fascinating peek in to the live of people that hunt/buy rare orchids. It also became the basis for the movie Adaptation.

David Sedaris- all of his books but especially Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, and When you are Engulfed in Flames. He's charming, strange, and honest."
5148,jv70pk,84,"We by Zamyatin. It was the first dystopia and the inspiration behind 1984. An incredibly well-written, haunting read. There’s a post on r/books that’s popular right now actually where Margaret Atwood talks about it in an article. I would recommend Natasha Randall’s translation. 

Speaking of Margaret Atwood and dystopias I would recommend Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. Brave New World by Huxley is another dystopia to check out (and see whether you believe Huxley never read and ripped off We or not). 

Horror: The Shining, IT, I’m thinking of ending things, Frankenstein, FantasticLand.

Comedy: The “Jeeves” series by P.G. Wodehouse. 

Some classics: Pride and Prejudice, To Kill a Mockingbird, Jane Eyre, Lolita, The Bell Jar, One Hundred Years of Solitude is beautiful and one of the best I’ve read."
5149,jv70pk,7,"Try this it's a book of facts about past US presidents.   I know how boring that sounds,  but it is a humorous book with things they don't teach in school,  like LBJ once urinating on the leg of a secret service agent.   {How to fight presidents} by Daniel O'Brien."

I love love love Dune by: Frank Herbert, but do not read this one unless you get really into sci-fi. Dune is a tough read."

^(By: Madeline Miller | 352 pages | Published: 2011 | Popular Shelves: historical-fiction, fantasy, fiction, mythology, lgbt | )[^(Search ""Song of Achilles"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Song of Achilles&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles. By all rights their paths should never cross, but Achilles takes the shamed prince as his friend, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine their bond blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles' mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess. But then word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped. Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus journeys with Achilles to Troy, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.
&gt;
&gt;Profoundly moving and breathtakingly original, this rendering of the epic Trojan War is a dazzling feat of the imagination, a devastating love story, and an almighty battle between gods and kings, peace and glory, immortal fame and the human heart.

5164,jv70pk,8,Thank you so much! There is such a variety here. I haven't read most of these so I'll be excited to dive into them!
5165,jv70pk,25,"I *never* pick up nonfiction, I don't know why!! Thank you so much!"
5166,jv70pk,22,Love David Sedaris! He used to do a segment or appear on a show on npr occasionally (not sure if he still does it) and I loved listening to him talk. He has the most unique voice and speaking cadence. His writing is fantastic as well.
5167,jv70pk,6,"That title sounds great, and I've heard good things about Jenny Lawson. Thank you!"
5168,jv70pk,3,My Real Children by Jo Walton. I had a book hangover for days after finishing this book.

5170,jv70pk,29,Another crazy memoir is The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls.
5171,jv70pk,7,"You know what, I've been wanting to get into sci-fi for so long and never know where to start. This will be a good jumping off point. Thank you!"
5172,jv70pk,3,2 recs for the same book? Oh yeah totally going to read this one!!
5173,jv70pk,16,"{Song of Achilles} is a greek myth re-telling, it's just....beautiful.

(Circe} ditto\^

(Hamnet} the writing is wonderful and you want to get to the end of it. Definitely not YA or cozy"
5174,jv70pk,3,"Yeah I don't mind gritty at all, or violence. I just sandwich it in between 2 other, more pleasant reads. Thank you!"
5175,jv70pk,5,"I'd recommend anything she's written! She's got three out so far with a fourth coming soon (if not already?) in that universe, plus a novella about space exploration and they're all just so lovely!!"
5176,jv70pk,5,"'Cosmicomics' by Italo Calvino. A book of short stories that'll blow your mind. Whatever you read, keep reading. I like how you want to switch it up. That's a good lesson for all readers."
5177,jv70pk,5,"The Expanse series by James S.A. Corey. Mankind gets space travel, but it' still a he'll of a commute, humans are still tribalistic, as always despite tech advances &amp;, ... well, I don't want to plot spoil. I'm tearing my way thru the series now. Start with the 1st novel {{Leviathan Wakes}} . I'm not much for sci-fi &amp; I couldn't put it down!"

5180,jv70pk,3,Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi. It's the best book I've read all year. Extremely relevant right now.
5181,jv70pk,4,I saw the movie I here the book is good
5182,jv70pk,5,The Iron Druid Chronicles are incredible and have a ton of mythology in them! There are nine books in the series and they're addictively good! It's hard to explain the story without revealing spoilers!
5183,jv70pk,51,Seconding Educated! Seriously such an amazing book.
5184,jv70pk,3,"I just finished reading Lincoln in the Bardo, I read it hand in hand with a study guide from Litcharts, for the chaper by chaper analysis.  It was very very good, and with the study guide, it gave me insights and explanations when I was a little confused by the prose.  

I really enjoyed it, and have fallen in love with study guides at the same time.  I just borrowed Wolf Hall again from the library, which I've already read BUT this time I want to read it along with the study guide to see what I missed the first time."

It’s definitely one of his shorter books, but it was so good. The movie is also fantastic if you ever need a movie suggestion and a good cry!"
5190,jv70pk,20,"The Time Traveler’s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger

His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust series by Philip Pullman

Person Scott Card is problematic in a lot of ways but Ender’s Game and Speaker of the Dead are fantastic

Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorites

I’m not really into Steinbeck but East of Eden is amazing

The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver

Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (Can’t remember the author)"
5191,jv70pk,5,"I've been liking Vonnegut a lot lately! Slaughterhouse Five is excellent, but my favorite of his so far has been The Sirens of Titan if you like sci fi."
5192,jv70pk,6,His Dark Materials takes up an enormous section of my heart &amp; soul so I just know the rest of these are going to be fantastic as well. Thank you!!
5193,jv70pk,5,{middlesex} by Jeffrey Eugenides
5194,jv70pk,27,Educated is phenomenal!! highly recommend!
5195,jv70pk,11,"Hell yeah for non fiction! Educated was fabulous. I just started reading “If Walls Could Talk: An Intimate History of the Home” by Lucy Worsley. I’m only a few chapters in, but it is really interesting so far. Also love anything Bill Bryson or Mary Roach for nonfiction."
5196,jv70pk,5,I second that - I was also gonna suggest Educated by Tara Westover. It’s a memoir and so well written. Could not put it down!
5197,jv70pk,6,"Life of Pi by Yann Martel,
Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden,
Wild by Cheryl Strayed"
5198,jv70pk,7,The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver.
5199,jv70pk,3,WOW this sounds so good!! Thank you!
5200,jv70pk,7,The Road by Cormac McCarthy. Grim as hell but amazingly written
5201,jv70pk,21,And Circe! They were both wonderful!
5202,jv70pk,3,"Someone else recommended the first one, too, so obviously I need to read it ASAP. I'll add all 3 to the list. Thank you!!"
5203,jv70pk,3,"Fantastic book (I enjoyed the whole trilogy but it can be read as a standalone) and it’s just under 300
pages so it goes quickly."
5204,jv70pk,3,"Critical failures by robert bevan. It’s like jumanji where they get stuck inside a board game but it’s dungeons and dragons instead of jumanji. And gratuitous crude humor. 

One of the best yo mama jokes in the first one is when they about to get arrested and the guards ask them if they have anything to explain themselves. It goes something like “well you see when i first arrived at this city we were starving and poor with only 3 copper coins left between us all. And, well, we couldn’t help it but it was a cheap group rate and the soldier’s captain’s mom took care of us all that night but we never got the two bits back in change she promised us”

I don’t see david baldacci get many recommendations. His style is direct and he has quite a few good series. His will robie series is about an assassin for the cia and the first book is reminiscent of leon the professional. Baldacci’s puller and maxwell series is good too. A pair of disgraced secret service agents start up a private investigation service and get dangerous cases. John puller series is a bit like jack reacher where the main character is an army investigator who left the service."
5205,jv70pk,4,{{A Gentleman in Moscow}}
5206,jv70pk,5,Me too! The Book of Dust trilogy is very different so far. The first two books have come out and they’re very good. The care and detail Philip Pullman puts into these stories is just amazing. I’m taking my time reading the second one because it was years between the first two coming out.
5207,jv70pk,4,"Endurance, by Alfred Lansing. It recounts the true, incredible journey of Ernest Shackleton to Antarctica just as WWI breaks out.  Nothing goes as planned. Gripping."
5208,jv70pk,3,"Just started reading a book myself that is so interesting. Titled, Furiously Happy by Jennifer Lawson. Try it; read everything up to page 6....if your not hooked by then probably won't do it for you. But I'm in love! Relatable and puts a funny spin on a unspoken about topic and one that has some bad karma."
5209,jv70pk,21,"It's often recommended on this sub, but I adore 'The Book Thief' - it's World War II fiction about a little girl in a small town in Germany. It's narrated by Death."
5210,jv70pk,5,"My Best Friend’s Exorcism by Grady Hendrix! It’s a horror/drama, definitely not YA genre but the characters are young adults so you would probably enjoy the story a lot! It’s not even really one of my top favorite books, but I still reread it all the time which is unusual for me as I’m not much of a rereader. I’ve read other works by the author too and he’s really good."
5211,jv70pk,4,"{{Daisy Jones and the Six}}

{{Kitchens of the Great Midwest}}"
5212,jv70pk,3,Love seeing multiple recs for the same book. Now I want to read it that much more. Thanks!
5213,jv70pk,4,"An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green, The House in the Cerulean Sea by T.J. Klune, and My Brain on Fire by Susannah Callahan all come to mind. The first is the first book in an engaging sci-fi duology. The second is an adult (light) fantasy story but is very accessible like YA.  The last is a memoir about a woman’s experience with a rare condition. It was engrossing. 

I wanted to suggest Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens but it may be considered mystery. 

If you like audiobooks, Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins is phenomenal on audio. It’s fully cast and felt real. It’s like Behind the Music in the best ways. Adult fiction"
5214,jv70pk,3,LOL time for a do over. I want to go through school again. I missed WAY too much;) hahah
5215,jv70pk,3,Middlesex by Jeffrey Euginides.
5216,jv70pk,5,You and I must read similar things! I LOVE LOVE LOVE both Bryson and Roach :) I'll add this book by Lucy Worsely to my own list. Thank you!
5217,jv70pk,3,"Slaughterhouse-five. It’s been a while since I read it but it’s a dark comedy about WWII but also about time travel and aliens and also about coming to terms with death. It’s funny and beautiful and sweet.

My other favourite book is Howl’s Moving Castle but that might be too YA for what you’re looking for."
5218,jv70pk,3,"Perfume by Patric Suskind
Night's Watch by Sergei Lukyanenko"
5219,jv70pk,3,"I'm currently re-reading the **Gone series**

5224,jv70pk,6,"Circe by Madeline Miller, The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison, and A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine are my three faves I've read in the last year!

If you want to take a slightly smaller step out of your comfort zone, Of Dragons, Feasts and Murders by Aliette de Bodard is a fantastic fantasy novella that contains a mystery, a romance, and some fun political machinations"
5225,jv70pk,3,Did we just be become best friends? These are spot on.
5226,jv70pk,3,"Stranger in a Strange Land has such a special place in my heart. 

I used to work in the oil field out in West Texas, my boss for years would call me into his office for “closed door meetings” where we would talk about our issues with anxiety being so far away from our families (it was shift work, so I’d be out there for a week and go home a week) and we always talked about the books we were reading. At the time The Martian had just come out and I remember telling him how much I was enjoying it. He ended up giving me a copy of Stranger in a Strange Land to keep and I was obsessed with it. He also gave me some meteorite from a nearby crater to go along with the theme. He overdosed a few years back after I quit working there and decided it wasn’t worth the anxiety. I always wished I’d have talked him into going home but I carry that book and those little chunks of meteor everywhere I go in a little back pack when I travel. 

RIP Nick."
5227,jv70pk,3,Yesssss plots and schemes!! And okay I won't look it up at all. It's so fun to just dive in unaware sometimes!! Thanks again XD
5228,jv70pk,3,"I was legitimately jealous when Ed Sheeran named his kid Lyra. I am done having kids (3) and thought.. well played, Sheeran, well played. Also my hubs has to have ablation (of the heart) done and I asked if it had to be approved by the ablation board. Listen I love Golden Compass is what I am saying. ❤️"
5229,jv70pk,9,"Have you read Red Rising? Or Ready Player One?

Those are two of my favorites."
5230,jv70pk,3,"ARE WE THE SAME PERSON??? I have three kids too and am done too. And while I didn’t know that Ed Sheeran named his daughter Lyra...now I am jealous. My husband hasn’t had an ablation, lol, but I love that you asked and I’m guessing you thought it was hilarious and he just looked at you, right???"
5231,jv70pk,5,This series!! Brilliant story telling. It’s not surprising she won Hugo Awards for every book in the series.
5232,jv70pk,5,"Haven't read either, so there's 2 more I'll be adding!"
5233,jv70pk,4,Love it!! Yes no idea but I laughed and that’s what matters 🤡
5234,jv70pk,3,A thousand splendid suns
5235,jv70pk,5,Born A Crime by Trevor Noah
5236,jv70pk,3,"**Coraline** - Neil Gaiman

A wonderful and genuinely creepy children’s story, but one of those that adults can enjoy just as much (if not more). **The Ocean at the End of the Lane** and **The Graveyard Book** are two others by Gaiman that are also excellent and fit, broadly speaking, into the same genre.

**The 7 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle** - Stuart Turton

One of the most intriguing books I’ve read in a long time. I’ve heard it described as a cross between Groundhog Day and an Agatha Christie murder mystery, which isn’t too far off. Absolutely loved the tone, the mystery, the characters, etc.

**Mistborn** - Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson is arguably the biggest name in Fantasy these days, and Mistborn is a fantastic starting point into his works. It’s not perfect, but in my opinion it comes pretty close. It’s really just masterfully done.

**Howl’s Moving Castle** - Dianna Wynne Jones

A beautifully written story that is just a delight to read. It was adapted into a Miyazaki movie, which a lot of people love as well, but personally I’ve always found the book to be stronger.

**Red Rising Trilogy** - Pierce Brown

A sci-fi series with fantasy-like elements in it. By the time I got to the third book, I was absolutely devouring it. Really compelling characters, world-building, and story in general.

**Pet Semetary** - Stephen King

I find King’s books to be a little bloated, and this was no exception, but it’s a haunting horror story. Probably my favorite horror story, actually.

**Locke &amp; Key** - Joe Hill

If you’re *really* trying to get out of your comfort zone, this is a graphic novel series that of absolutely phenomenal. It’s a horror series primarily (written, actually, by Stephen King’s son), and is a little gruesome (especially in the first volume), but is absolutely worth the journey."
5237,jv70pk,3,I usually hate anything that’s *not* non-fiction but I found **Circe** to be outstanding! Song of Achilles was good too but I liked Circe more. Happy reading!!
5238,jv70pk,17,"My story by Elizabeth smart is also an amazing non fiction about a girl who was kidnapped

Night by Eli Wiesel is a great story about a guy who survived the Holocaust"
5239,jv70pk,15,"I love when people recommend A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet on here, it’s so insanely good ! Definitely worth a read"
5240,jv70pk,3,"I came here to second this series. Absolutely loved everything about it and was hooked from beginning to end. More so than the story itself how the author presented it and drop fed certain story points was well done.

I wasn't sure whether to recommend this myself cause I felt it might be YA? Idk cause I got recommend it after finishing red rising but if it is definitely breaks the usual mold with ease and makes it feel fresh."
5241,jv70pk,6,Try Murderbot diaries. It’s a fantastic sci-fi series!
5242,jv70pk,4,"I never do either but there *are* a lot of good ones. I mentioned Bill Bryson in my comment, he is very good. Also Mary Roach and the authors mentioned above.

Allow me to add A Fire Upon the Deep by (iirc) Verner vinge, has some strange things that are really neat, I am constantly calling my dog “scrode rider” and my wife hate it so much."
5243,jv70pk,3,It’s certainly not YA. It’s about a mid 40’s woman and has some pretty heavy sexy scenes.
5244,jv70pk,3,"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath or 
The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway or
The Handmaids Tale and 
Testaments by Margaret Atwood"
5245,jv70pk,12,Honestly I'd suggest Oryx and Crake / the Mad Addam series before Handmaid's Tale. Environmental / Corporate  dystopia that is one of my all-time favorite reads.
5246,jv70pk,3,The shadow of the wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón
5247,jv70pk,3,and the story is great too!
5248,jv70pk,3,what kind of genre is it ? just by the title it sounds interesting !
5249,jv70pk,3,"The remains of the day, by Kazuo Ishiguro. In fact anything by him is amazing."
5250,jv70pk,5,"It’s her memoir! It’s genuinely very funny, I’d recommend it to everyone"
5251,jv70pk,3,"Ooh! Ooh! Try the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. I know it just came out with a movie, and I honestly haven’t seen it yet, but I don’t think there’s a great way to translate the books into film. ANYWAY, this series is great, and you won’t feel too far out of place as the books start with a very YA feel and progressively mature. These books are thrilling and heartbreaking and deeply personal works for the author (you’ll see what I mean). I’m finishing my third read of the whole 7-part series. I would love to see the lessons from these stories in more hands. I know that I’ve grown from reading them."
5252,jv70pk,8,The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson! Epic fantasy at its finest
5253,jv70pk,3,"My favorite book is Dune, and its kinda hard to read but afterwards it kind of leaves a mark on you that most books can’t compare too imo."
5254,jv70pk,3,"Anything by K.A Tucker. Some of my favorites I would reccomend to start with would be burying water, chasing river, becoming rain then surviving ice. It's like a seriese but her way of writing to incorporate each book together is really cool. They're fun and sweet, some romance, and the story lines I've always loved. She has a lot of other books I love but I always come back to these ones."
5255,jv70pk,3,Trust me it’s one of the only non fiction books (other than night) that had me completely hooked from start to finish
5256,jv70pk,3,"It is my forever favourite series, I absolutely love it!"
5257,jv70pk,4,A classic one: John Irving - A prayer for Owen Meany. A wonderful coming of age story in the 50s/60s. One of the best books I‘ve ever read
5258,jv70pk,4,"Anything by Terry Pratchett or Neil Gaiman. Both do fantasy so well and Pratchett is so funny. There are some Pratchett ones that are crime related (Night Watch books), but there are other groupings (witches, wizards, industrialization, Death) so just about any of them are a good choice. Gaiman likes to make his own versions of fairy tales and myths so there's some neat exploration of those types of themes in his works. My personal favorites from them are: American Gods by Neil Gaiman and Reaper Man by Terry Pratchett. They also co-wrote a book, Good Omens that's pretty fun, too."
5259,jv70pk,6,"I always recommend Memoirs of a Geisha.  So addictive from the very beginning, couldn’t put it down. Many times I teared up a little bit!"
5260,jv70pk,5,"OMG ARE YOU ME???

Saving this post because I need these recommendations too!"
5261,jv70pk,4,The autobiography of Malcolm X!!!
5262,jv70pk,3,i am really gonna have to read it !
5263,jv70pk,3,Yes! Educated! I was going to say exactly this. I'm not a big nonfiction fan but loved educated.
5264,jv70pk,3,Never Let Me Go is a personal favourite!!
5265,jv70pk,4,"Dune! A classic and staple in Science Fiction/fantasy. Its honestly a slog for a bout 180 pages, but once you make it past that you will be physically unable to put it down."
5266,jv70pk,3,Try starship troopers. Classic military sci-fi
5267,jv70pk,4,"Interview with the Vampire- Anne Rice
It's a great book and I highly recommend"
5268,jv70pk,3,"I just finished reading A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It was a pleasantly delightful read, and a bit new to me as well."
5269,jv70pk,3,I liked Ender in Exile more than Xenocide and it reads like an alternate ending. I liked the Enders Shadow series more than the rest of Enders series proper. I found bean and the aftermath of earth to be the more interesting story line although I always loved Enders Game.

5282,jv72ho,7,Anything by James Herriot!
5283,jv72ho,8,"I am currently attempting to get into Vet school. My number 1 recommendation is try to get her interested in Chemistry. The biggest place prospective Vet students fail is Chemistry classes (specifically a class called Organic Chemistry). If you can make her genuinely interested in chemistry from a younger age then once she hits the weed-out classes she will be more prepared than 99% of her peers. Veterinary practice is arguably the hardest field of work to get into simply due to the difficulty of getting into Vet school, preparing her for the worst, getting her a feel for chemical reactions and the fundamentals of atomics and making her feel excited about it is the best possible thing you can do for her. Best of luck and god speed"
5284,jv72ho,5,"Me too, I loved those books."
5285,jv72ho,3,"Gerald Durrell - Corfu trilogy. Sort of memoirs, a young boy fascinated by all animals, living in Corfu and enjoying it. These are quite nice and funny books, I remember reading them first around 14 years old too."
5286,jv72ho,4,She’s 14...she’s old enough for adult books.
5287,jv72ho,3,"I came here to say this, can’t recommend it enough generally and with this request? Perfect"
5288,jv72ho,4,"Veterinarian here, all these are great suggestions, but realize we have the highest suicide rate in the country. These suggestions are mostly romanticized versions of the real story, James Herriot included, and while of course I love him the worst thing you can do is continue this unrealistic view of vets without knowing the truth. School is expensive, pay is low, the hours are hard and everybody thinks you have all this money and if you *really* cared about animals you would save their animal for free. They don't realize how many of us are already living in poverty, or having to choose whether to go to vet school and spend the rest of your life paying down student debt, or have a family. It's crushing when an owner tries to make you take the financial or emotional responsibility of a disease they don't want to spend the money to treat or prevent.
I used to say don't be a vet, but now I say, make sure to specialize instead of being a general practitioner. Be a surgeon or cardiologist or whatever. Know how much school is going to cost, and how much you're going to be paid when you graduate, and what kind of lifestyle you will be able to afford (or not.) By all means, get her a great cute book, but also at least some ideas about what realistically it will be. Maybe getting her a job at a clinic is a good idea."
5289,jv8mdu,45,"Mary Roach's book Stiff. She is a science writer and does have humor.

Another might be A Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion."
5290,jv8mdu,22,"I took a class on death and dying in college, and we read Tuesdays with Morrie and The Last Lecture. Most books about death do have some sort of spiritual exploration element, but not necessarily religious. I also highly recommend Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Other Lessons from the Crematory for a more lighthearted, albeit graphic, approach."
5291,jv8mdu,3,Grief is the thing with feathers by Max Porter
5292,jv8mdu,31,"I think Atul Gawande's {{Being Mortal}} would be exactly what you were looking for! This is a great book on aging, illness and mortality from the perspective of a modern physician and medical treatment. It is nice exploration of the last moments of dying patient with poignant personal touch all through out the book."
5293,jv8mdu,5,"[**Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696006-being-mortal)

&gt;In Being Mortal, author Atul Gawande tackles the hardest challenge of his profession: how medicine can not only improve life but also the process of its ending
&gt;
&gt;Medicine has triumphed in modern times, transforming birth, injury, and infectious disease from harrowing to manageable. But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extend suffering.
&gt;
&gt;Gawande, a practicing surgeon, addresses his profession's ultimate limitation, arguing that quality of life is the desired goal for patients and families. Gawande offers examples of freer, more socially fulfilling models for assisting the infirm and dependent elderly, and he explores the varieties of hospice care to demonstrate that a person's last weeks or months may be rich and dignified.

5294,jv8mdu,7,On death and dying by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross
5295,jv8mdu,3,From a sciencey perspective this is the go to - “The Worm at the Core: On the Role of Death in Life”. I personally liked it and it helped shape some of my thinking through things in my own life.
5296,jv8mdu,5,I second Mary Roach's book. So interesting
5297,jv8mdu,9,Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
5298,jv8mdu,5,"Caitlin Doughty also has a YouTube channel where she talks about death. While it's a little bit more light-hearted than what you can find in her books, I still find her videos highly informative and helpful. You should definitely give it a watch if you have the time. It definitely helped me change my views on death. ( And her books are also great. The first one is a must-read!)."
5299,jv8mdu,6,I lost a family member in a car accident recently as well and just wanted to offer condolences.
5300,jv8mdu,8,Consider *Man's Search for Meaning.*
5301,jv8mdu,3,Slightly different to exactly what you said but Caitlin Doughty is a mortician whos written several books on death and dying. I’d recommended these books to anyone anyways but she states how much easier death is to cope with and appreciate when you’re educated about it and i truly agree. The two of her books id recommend to get started with are “Will my cat eat my eyeballs” and “Smoke gets in your eyes”. The first of them two is really lighthearted even with fun drawings.
5302,jv8mdu,3,"Sum: Forty Tales from The Afterife, by David Eagleman.

It's a collection of 40 short stories where the author just imagines what an afterlife could be like. In some there are gods, some creators, some nothing,  some are very sci fi, some are intriguing. The author is a neuroscientist which kind of contributes to the style of the content.
 At its worst this book was very enjoyable -at its best it made me introspective and appreciative of the simple act of being alive. Good luck man. 
(Ps . This book is available to download free as an epub (ebook) from z library. Com if you want- helpful hint)"
5303,jv8mdu,3,Caitlyn Dougherty has some really good books about death. She's a death positive mortician with a YouTube channel. From here to eternity is my favorite.
5304,jv8mdu,15,When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalinithi. The memoir of a genius neurosurgeon who was suddenly diagnosed with terminal cancer and given months to live. It details his struggles in going from being a doctor to being a patient and coming to terms with his own mortality.
5305,jv8mdu,5,"The year of magical thinking by Joan Didion.
Non-fiction about the loss of the author’s beloved husband and daughter within months of each other. It’s beautiful and sobering and, of course, since it’s Didion, really well written."
5306,jv8mdu,5,Smoke gets in your eyes by Caitlyn Doughty. A crematorium worker shares her experiences and how she came to terms with her fear of death. A tastefully funny and eye opening work.
5307,jv8mdu,3,"I return to this book, every time the fear gets the best of me.... 👍"
5308,jv8mdu,7,"*How to Die* by Seneca. It's a collection of letters written by a Stoic to his friends about the deaths of their loved ones, his own death (he was extremely sick), and why we shouldn't be afraid of death or saddened by it."
5309,jv8mdu,3,"Absolutely. Her project, The Order of the Good Death, is all about examining your feelings around death and hopefully coming to an okay place with it."

5311,jv8mdu,3,"I'm so glad you posted about her, I too really like her.  I don't think I'll ever reach her level of calmness, acceptance and matter-of-factness, but when I feel the wolf at the door, now I just watch her channel to remind me that everything is as it should be."
5312,jv8mdu,3,From Here to Eternity by Caitlyn Doughty
5313,jv8mdu,3,I really loved *The Lovely Bones.* It addresses death but it also has a very lovely theme of our loved ones still watching over us. I also loved her creative interpretation of heaven. It is one of my absolute favorite books.
5314,jv8mdu,3,"Well, religion does not equal spirituality. Also, OP wants to come to term with the realities of death, not the metaphysical, religious, or spiritual aspect."
5315,jv8mdu,3,"It was a pretty dark and traumatic read, for me. A beautiful book, but I wish I had never read it. At the very least it should come with a trigger warning of rape (and hints of mutilation, if I remember correctly)."
5316,jvafar,6,"I read Mistborn because it was recommended so much, I liked the first book, got trough the second book somehow, but I didn't pick up the last one.

It gets usually recommended for ""fantasy / magic with a female protagonist"", and the only other book that I can think of is the Rise of Kyoshi by F. C. Yee, but that's a spinoff for a series, and I don't know how people that aren't fans would feel about it."
5317,jvafar,12,"The Girl on the Train. Read it when it first came out and everyone was heralding it like it was the best thing ever. I hated it and was SO underwhelmed by it. Actually stopped reading mystery after this and switched to different genres.

The Goldfinch. I absolutely LOVED Secret History by Donna Tartt and that seems to be her less popular book compared to Goldfinch. DNF it because i disliked it so much."
5318,jvafar,4,"*The Cloud Atlas* (David Mitchell). Amazing prose, but the concept is fatally flawed and collapses under its own weight. I would recommend *Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World* (Haruki Murakami) instead. A dizzying and surreal dual narrative that actually works.

For nonfiction, I think that *A Brief History of Time* (Stephen Hawking) is more confusing than it is illuminating. Instead I would recommend *Seven Brief Lessons on Physics* (Carlo Rovelli)."
5319,jvafar,17,"Ready player one, didn’t finish the book and didn’t like the movie. 

The Mortality Doctrine series is much better. It starts with  [The Eye of Minds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16279856-the-eye-of-minds).

Both feature VR, but in vastly different ways, also unlike RP1 The Mortality Doctrine doesn’t shove nostalgia down your throat."
5320,jvafar,10,"1. The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle: I thought this book was a MESS. The first person narration felt extremely cringey to me, there are what feels like 1,000 timelines to keep track of, and the ending is infuriating in that it doesn’t totally make sense, it creates WAY more questions (and like, not in a fun way), and just wasn’t set up well at all. 

What to read instead: The Guest List by Lucy Foley. Honestly I thought this book was delightful. Employs multiple narratives super well (IMO), and I was personally surprised by the ending and felt like it was set up very well. 

2. The Silent Patient: also hated this one, but primarily it was because I felt like the writing was just...not...good (I’m sorry I know that’s a hot take!)? I felt like it was a good story, but a bad book. 

What to read instead: I read The Whisper Man by Alex North not too long after reading the silent patient and generally liked it a lot more and found it checked a lot of the same boxes for me that The Silent Patient would have if I had liked it more. The Whisper Man was super fast, kept me on my toes for most of the book, and was overall a pretty enjoyable and fun read."
5321,jvafar,3,"Omg, I've been trying to remember what that book was for ages. You're right though it's so much better than Ready Player One."
5322,jvafar,3,"It’s so much better, and because it was planned as a trilogy it’s not rushed and flat like RP1."
5323,jvafar,10,"Stranger in a Strange Land. Hate it! Sexist, homophobic, racist, outdated and just dull. Read the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson instead for a very indepth look at how society, culture, economics, radicalism, politics, etc develop on a terraformed Mars."
5324,jvafar,4,I agree with your take on Seven Deaths...it just didnt work for me.
5325,jvafar,3,ready player one is an ok book. but it's probably a book made for 15 years old dudes and girls. not adults
5326,jvafar,6,"Which is even stranger because it’s chocked full of hamfisted in 80’s nostalgia references, and era that the targeted audience never experienced."
5327,jvafar,3,"yeah. it kinda felt like ""yeah son. the 80s were so cool!"" vibe.
for me it was a basic common YA fantasy book..."
5328,jvafar,7,Red Rising was laugh out loud bad. Better to just read the books it tries to copy: Hunger Games and Ender's Game.
5329,jvafar,3,"**Like Water for Chocolate** by Laura Esquival  - Not only is the romance not believable in any sense, but the magical food emotion element didn't really do anything for me. The M/C didn't do anything intentionally with her cooking ability.

**The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake** by Aimee Bender - This book took Esquival's food empathy concept, destroyed it, rebuilt it up, and executed it 10x better. It explores a lot of the same themes that Esquival was trying to communicate in her book but takes the time to criticize and discuss them. It's not everyone's cup of tea. The ending made perfect sense to me but left a lot of people weirded out."
5330,jvafar,7,"I do not care for A Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood at all. I found the characters to be two-dimensional, the plot was contrived and not convincing and frankly I just was not interested. 

I would recommend Kindred by Octavia Butler instead. Although the story is about racial oppression as opposed to gender oppression, they both deal with forced bondage. And you really empathize with the narrator in Kindred."
5331,jvafar,3,"Unrelated to suggestion thread but you should really finish the series! I agree with you that the second book was a slog, but the third book redeemed it, at least for me."
5332,jvafar,5,"My pet peeve here, but I see The Tattooist of Auschwitz recommenced all the time and just wanna replace it with Elie Wiesel’s Night."
5333,jvafar,4,"The Night Circus had such potential but fell so flat

Dune has so many flaws, I know it’s a classic but it’s hard to read a book with a boring main character, plot-device female characters, and a fat, ugly villian who’s most sinful act is molesting MALE and not FEMALE youths


Instead of Dune, maybe try Old Man’s War by John Scalzi. Instead of Night Circus, watch the movie Moulin Rouge"
5334,jvafar,3,I absolutely agree about Dune. TWO female characters that are the main character’s mother and love interest
5335,jvagjs,8,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon
5336,jvagjs,10,Not an easy suggestion after such a classic. Maybe Slaughterhouse 5 by Vonnegut.
5337,jvagjs,3,"Good on you for picking up the book. 
Be proud of yourself. It’s a credit to your character."
5338,jvagjs,3,Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck.
5339,jvagjs,3,Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro
5340,jvba4i,5,"**A Tale for the Time Being** by Ruth Ozeki is amazing and checks a lot of boxes that you’re looking for.

You might also enjoy **A Gentleman in Moscow** by Amor Towles, which is a little bit different thematically, I found it to be more hopeful than *Pachinko*, but is wonderfully written and has a historically interesting setting."
5341,jvba4i,3,"A Gentleman in Moscow looks really good, thanks!"
5342,jvba4i,6,*Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi might fit what you’re looking for! Story starts with two sisters living in Ghana during the eighteenth century and then each chapter follows their descendants all the way up to modern day. Great read.
5343,jvba4i,5,"Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi is really good and matches the description of multiple generations, being set (mostly) outside of the US, and it takes place over something like 8 generations. Pachinko and East of Eden are my two favorite books as I love multigenerational stories, and Homegoing is incredible and is up there on my list! It’s a short read but isn’t “easy” from an emotional perspective, as the plot revolves around multigenerational trauma and how your ancestor’s experiences shape your own life. Highly recommend it though!!"
5344,jvba4i,3,One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
5345,jvcrv7,3,"Sorry to hear about your diagnosis! This might be an out-there suggestion, but I always like TC Boyle's The Road to Wellville. It was a cozy read to me for some reason, not sure why, maybe cuz of the era in which it takes place or the dialogue of that time in history too."
5346,jvcrv7,3,"I will say this each and every time - any book by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but in particular {Daisy Jones and the Six}. She is a charming writer, and her characters are infinitely likeable. High marks also go to {The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo}"
5347,jvhprg,3,"I'd recommend This Is How You Lose The Time War. It's sci fi fantasy and it's fantastic. The characters are just... wow

If you have a genre you're looking for in particular, lmk :)"
5348,jvhprg,3,"I read that recently! I absolutely loved it! I need to read it again since it's so short and I feel like I didn't pick up on everything the first time through. I really, REALLY wish it was longer. I would have loved to see the characters and world expanded upon, and I feel like a lot of the scenes could have done with more setup and detail. Overall I thought it was fantastic and one of my favorite books

(Also happy b-day :P)"
5349,jvhprg,3,"Ah I'm always amazed when an author can do it all in fewer words haha but hey I'm glad I hit the nail on the head!! In that case, other recommendations:

1. The Bell Jar (very depressing, make sure you're emotionally and mentally prepared, but great character)
2. The Chosen One by Carol Lynch Williams (my favorite book of all time)
3. The Haunting of Hill House (i'd call it literary horror. I'm into it. There's also apparently a show...?...!)"
5350,jvhprg,4,"Oh yeah — Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant has good characters, though they aren’t really *like-able* if that makes sense.


GRRM is amazing at creating character led stories as well."

5359,jvhprg,5,"*The Remains of the Day* by Kazuo Ishiguro is a fantastic example of first person writing done well.  The narrator is an English Butler on the verge of retirement, and his propriety oozes through his thoughts and language as well as his dialogue.  

The story focuses on his narration of the years leading up to World War II.  He's not a fully reliable narrator.  Not because he lies to the reader, but because he doesn't fully realize himself what was happening, and what sort of man he worked for.  At one point he narrates what he thinks of as ""the proudest day of his life"", and meanwhile I'm swearing audibly at him because he just doesn't realize what he's missing and what he's lost.  A major part of his arc is him slowly coming to understand.

Another author from a completely different genre who does first person character writing exceptionally well is N.K. Jemisin.  I recommend both the trilogy beginning with *The Fifth Season* and the one beginning with *The Hundred-Thousand Kingdoms* for this.  One thing I particularly enjoyed in her writing is the way the characters' voices changed as they grew, particularly in the final book of the Inheritance (Hundred-Thousand Kingdoms) trilogy."

After that I got East of Eden and Of Mice and Men. Haven't read them yet but I'm already a Steinbeck fan."

A time machine mechanic deals with his daddy issues and Buddhism is the vehicle for most of the book. It was life shattering and saved me from passive ideation. I had been going through a stent of *nothingness* and this yanked me out of it. 

The Licanius trilogy by James Islington is a beautiful, epic romp of a fantasy story, also involving time travel (prophecy too). 

Deals with good vs evil, fate vs free will, friends becoming enemies, compassion. It is long, but isn’t a slow burn at all. It also has lovely prose, great character development, and a ton of details in a world rich in history."
5388,jvj2zk,7,"Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson is such a powerful eye-opener on the flaws of the justice system, it changed my worldview when it comes to racial and sociopolitical injustices.

&gt;From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.
&gt;
&gt;Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.
&gt;
&gt;Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.
&gt;
&gt;Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.

About 300 pages but super big font and beautiful illustrations scattered throughout. So they’re like long kids books, but for older kids, I guess? Both stories are about journeys that are lighthearted and bring up interesting ideas about life. They’re cute, funny, end with heartwarming ends. But they also don’t shy away from problems and struggles that the main characters have. They’re definitely not the most challenging or intellectual, but they’re beautiful and really bring a smile to my face. I highly recommend them to anyone!

&gt;Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. 
&gt;
&gt;Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.
&gt;
&gt;After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. 
&gt;
&gt;Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. 
&gt;
&gt;But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?

&gt;
&gt;Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his ""meaningless"" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: ""Why was I here?""

5435,jvlf9i,3,"A Man Called Ove by Backman is a lovely read, and it's something I found very heartwarming and charming :) It's a story that feels very human in my opinion.

A more lively and light read I would recommend is Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones. It's aimed towards children, but it's also a very fun read, especially for getting immersed into stories about magic and fantasy. It's one of my favorites and is always able to lift my spirits. 

Being Mortal by Gawande is also a good read, though I'm not too sure if it will exactly fit for your father. It explores the concepts and perspectives of the quality of the lives people lead as they can approach their last days. It's very insightful, and even if you don't think it's something your father would like, I recommend it to you or your relatives.

I'm also going to throw A Winter's Tale by Shakespeare as well. It's one of my favorite plays by him. It's very fun and lighthearted, exploring love and forgiveness (though in Shakespeare's unique storytelling). I found the ending to be very bittersweet."

Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts is an incredible read. It's a fictional work, although the author claims it is based on true events in his life and it has some detractors (it's a Caucasian man describing Indian culture, so some unconscious reliance on stereotype is probably inevitable) but it was somehow life affirming all the same.

I would also recommend looking at Nuala Ó Faoláin's works, which are influenced by her experience growing up in Ireland and her memoirs. I say this particularly as background for a slightly different suggestion. 

Ó Faoláin was a predominant literary and feminist voice here - very well known to my mother's generation - and passed away perhaps a decade ago from cancer. She did a radio interview for RTE Radio One with her friend, broadcaster Marian Finucane, about how she was dying which was incredibly heartbreaking, but so raw and so real, not sugar coated and far from a narrative of a stoic soldier fighting a good fight. My mum and I listened to it together in the kitchen of our old house the afternoon it was broadcast. It is not uplifting as such but it is immensely powerful and opened the country up to conversation about a fear of dying and legitimising feeling however you want to feel. A difficult listen, but one with the ring of truth that you may find to be of help."
5447,jvlf9i,4,"The Name of the Wind (and after that The Wise Man's fear) from Patrick Rothfuss. There is no third part yet, but it really does not matter to me at this (or that of your dad's) point. Beautiful books about a man (Kvothe) who's waiting to die, telling story of his life, silence in three parts. Third part may come in few years but story-not-finished can still be a beautiful story, like an allegory of life."
5448,jvlf9i,9,"Really sorry to hear this! 

I would recommend - **The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch**. The author was a professor of computer science and received a terminal diagnosis from pancreatic cancer. And he wrote this as a motivator for everyone to achieve their childhood dreams, and never go gentle into that good night."
5449,jvlf9i,3,I agree with this. It's a lovely read.
5450,jvlf9i,4,"Second this recommendation. The Last Lecture is a very sweet book, truly pulls at the heart."
5451,jvlf9i,18,"Terry Pratchett is fun, surreal, and has an unique take on death. I’d suggest one of his books, or Good Omens that he wrote with Neil Gaiman"
5452,jvlf9i,10,I will check it out and see if it's something he would be interested in! Thank you for the suggestion and your kind words &lt;3
5453,jvlf9i,22,Thank you so much. This seems like a popular opinion and I will definitely add it to my list &lt;3
5454,jvlf9i,3,Came here to suggest Stuart McLean!
5455,jvlf9i,31,You guys beating cancer...I bloody love to hear it 👍🏾👍🏾
5456,jvlf9i,3,"Why not a blank journal for him to write sumthin for u guys to read to kids in the future. Embarrassing kid stories... Advice, how-to-fix stuff."
5457,jvlf9i,7,"That’s an awful thing to say. Books are also about escape, giving peace and hope. There is always time for that. OP is looking for something to help their father be uplifted, has specifically asked for books. If you don’t have a suggestion, just say you’re sorry and move on, not that it’s a waste of time for him."
5458,jvlf9i,4,Me talk pretty one day had me laughing out loud the entire book. Great recommendation.
5459,jvlf9i,16,That's great to hear. In some ways beating cancer can really help you appreciate the life you have. I hope you are doing better than ever by now
5460,jvlf9i,6,"I will check it out. Thank you for the suggestion, if I get it I will tell him ""shugatips suggested it"" and see if I can get a laugh outta him"
5461,jvlf9i,5,Thank you for your kind wishes &lt;3 he doesnt like attention too much but if I showed him this thread I think itd put a smile on his face
5462,jvlf9i,7,"Terry Pratchett is a wonderfully funny author. One of the recurring characters in his books is Death himself-- but far from being a grim, dark, and lonely figure, Pratchett went out of his way to make Death a very lovable and empathetic character. This was such an important aspect of his works that when he was knighted, he chose for the motto on his coat of arms  *Noli Timere Messorem* \-- ""Don't fear the reaper.""

If you don't think the mere thought of it is too pessimistic (and I promise I am not trying to be insensitive with this recommendation), I strongly recommend *Reaper Man* by Terry Pratchett. Among other things, it includes a scene where Death fights back against his replacement, admonishing the new grim reaper by declaring ""You're doing it all wrong! Death isn't supposed to be scary!""

If, however, you think that that is too insensitive or too on-the-nose, many other works by Terry Pratchett are also fantastically funny. 

*Equal Rites* is incredibly fun, as is *Going Postal* and *Guards! Guards!*"
5463,jvlf9i,3,I will check it out. I might try to have a quick read through of books like this just so I know. Thank you for the suggestion
5464,jvlf9i,14,"Im not sure its going to be appropriate for him, but you may personally wish to read A Monster Calls. About dealing with grief over the loss of a parent."
5465,jvlf9i,4,I'd second this - if your dad enjoys a sense of humor then Terry Pratchett would be a great author for him.
5466,jvlf9i,4,"I tried to upvote this twice this book is so good!!! It is very heavy into cancer and death, so it may not be the best for op’s dad as a Christmas gift, but it’s a good book for anyone ever"

Look who's morphing by Tom Cho

Dragon springs road by Janie Chang

Children of blood by Tomi Adeyemi

Severance by Ling Ma

These aren't that recent, but a few are pretty obscure.
Have you tried getting your mum to get a Goodreads account so you can snoop through her tbr?"
5468,jvt61q,8,"Senlin Ascends, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, and The Goblin Emperor are three lesser known SFF books that I'd highly recommend."
5469,jvt61q,5,"You might try a book from Walter Moers. I've heard those are sometimes marked as for children, but don't mind that. He's one of a Kind and i found None author to compare His Stile of writing to."
5470,jvt61q,5,"The Runelords by David Farland. In a magical world where people can take ""endowments"" from others and become known as Runelords, such as strength or speed, a warlord from the south has taken so many that he has become a nearly invincible walking god and has launched a hostile takeover of the world. The Runelords in kingdoms of the north must unite to defend against him"
5471,jvt61q,4,"I'm not quite sure they count as recent, or obscure (They are heavily lauded, and a few years old, and the author just won a MacArthur Genius grant) but if your mother hasn't already read The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisin, they should! It's beautifully written, incredibly creative, and as an added bonus, has some great things to say about motherhood as well.

I'll try and pull some more obscure ones also.

Elatsoe by Darcie Little Badger - YA, but fantastic and creative. And just a few months old. 

Ring Shout by P. Djeli Clark - Phenomenal book, and just a few months old. Sort of Lovecraft meets Southern Horror. 

A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers - I'm not sure how obscure it is, but me and a small contingent of people madly love this book (and the whole series) because it manages to be deeply kind and gentle and empathetic towards it's characters in a way that almost no fiction is."
5472,jvt61q,5,The broken earth trilogy is SUCH A DELIGHT
5473,jvud8f,23,"Hi. I’m also a fan of horror although I don’t enjoy slasher/serial killer. Mine is more of the slow burn and building terrifying atmospheres. 
I’ve also read several Stephen King’s books and agree with you that some are not horrifying. 

This are the ones I’ve enjoyed:

The Book of Blood from Clive Barker (short stories though).
Song from the Unraveling of the World from Brian Evenson (also short stories).
House of Leaves from Mark Danielewski (this one is more dread than horror for me). 

And of course I’m a big fan of the classics HP Lovecraft (you can find his complete works in ebook for a dollar) and Edgar Allan Poe."
5474,jvud8f,32,"House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski is often considered to be one of the creepiest, most unsettling books ever. I’m getting it for Christmas and so am excited to get into it"
5475,jvud8f,14,"Try ""The Troop"" by Nick Cutter. Teenage boys camp on an island and a fungus breaks out. I read it a year ago and still find myself thinking about it.   


""The Sacrifice Box"" is another one I'd recommend."
5476,jvud8f,8,"Thank you! Very much appreciated. I've considered HP Lovecraft before but I'm not really sure where I should start, any tips?

I'll also take a look into your other suggestions. I enjoy short stories as much as I fo novels so I'm definitely interested."
5477,jvud8f,5,"I might join you in discovering it then,  thank you!"

The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker 
I Am Legend by Richard Matheson 
The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson 
The Turn of the Screw by Henry James"
5479,jvud8f,3,"No problem! I’ve deliberately not read much about it because I’m told the experience is much better if you go in blind, so I’ve avoided reading reviews and things like that. I really hope it’s as terrifying as people say it is"
5480,jvud8f,10,For HP Lovecraft I have fond memories and often reread The Call of Cthulhu and At the Mountains of Madness. One of my friends told me he was too slow and descriptive for her and that’s especially what I enjoy so maybe give those a try first. You can find them for free also in ebooks.
5481,jvud8f,26,"Just don’t read it on ebook format. This book needs to be read on a physical copy. I read it on my kindle and will be purchasing the physical copy for a second read, I feel I lost so much of the fun."
5482,jvud8f,26,Intensity by Dean Koontz kept me up all night.
5483,jvud8f,12,**American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis**
5484,jvud8f,13,I Am Legend is a GREAT book. Don't recall it being very scary but definitely worth reading.
5485,jvud8f,10,"The hunger by Alma Katsu.  It’s about the Donner Reed party.. except something is stalking them. A little boy goes missing only to be found miles away.. they are coming across human sacrifices..

The last days by Adam Neville. I don’t believe in anything supernatural, but when it’s late and night and the mind wonders..  well I start to imagine the Blood Friends and it’s hard to get to sleep"
5486,jvud8f,6,I just finished the Troop and holy hell is it gross
5487,jvud8f,80,"Almost anything by Clive Barker. His imagination is unparalleled. Everything I’ve ever read is derivative of something, that’s just the nature of creativity. Yet nothing is like Clive Barker. 

Imajica is enormous but so worth it and blew my mind.

The Thief of Always is technically (I believe his only) book aimed at kids but it’s still good. 

Weaveworld is disturbing and deep"
5488,jvud8f,34,"The Hot Zone is perhaps the scariest book I’ve ever read. Although it is non-fiction (slightly embellished) it reads like a novel. The first time I started reading it, I was sitting at a restaurant mid-day and I was so engrossed in the horror that even in those surroundings I was getting chills. I almost forgot where I was."

Happy reading."
5490,jvud8f,5,"I'm looking for the kind of read that leaves you thinking about it for a year, thanks!"
5491,jvud8f,3,"True, maybe more unsettling and suspenseful than actually scary"
5492,jvud8f,6,The Tell-Tale heart is pretty good. Not scary just spine tingling
5493,jvud8f,3,"Pretty girls by Karin slaughter. It’s a thriller, not technically horror but it’s the only book I can think of that has actually scarred me."
5494,jvud8f,5,{{The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins}} is like a horror/fantasy about someone trying to either stop the apocalypse or maybe cause it (... it's hard to say lol) by using crazy-ass magic and a lot of people die in gruesome ways. I never get scared by books so I can't vouch that it's terrifying; I absolutely loved this book.
5495,jvud8f,5,"The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson is pretty unsettling. I read it in 9th grade and recently reread it at the beginning of October. I’m 28 now so it was like reading it for the first time all over.

ETA: Its more of a psychological horror story but the ending in particular is what is really unsettling to me."
5496,jvud8f,13,We Have Always Lived in the Castle is considered horror?  I didn't find it frightening in the least.  I just thought the characters were awesome and weird.
5497,jvud8f,7,I think it depends on how close to home the family characters hit for you.
5498,jvud8f,3,"I read Darren Shaw when I was younger... I seem to remember a demon child with cocroach spewing holes instead of eyes... I'll look into that one, thanks!"
5499,jvud8f,8,Very intriguing. Originality in horror is hard to come by. Thanks!
5500,jvud8f,3,Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates - My warning is that it was depressing to me and some of the scenes stayed with me in a way that I did not want them to.
5501,jvud8f,3,"I've seen the Exorcist suggested all over the place, but I'm concerned that since I already watched the film it might lose some of its edge for me..."
5502,jvud8f,3,"I watched the Netflix series based on it and loved it, but if the ending's the same as the book's I'm afraid I'll have self-spoiled the ending..."
5503,jvud8f,5,Horror non-fiction? If it shook you up that badly I'll definitely have to take a look. Thanks!
5504,jvud8f,12,"Ghost Story by Peter Straub is the scariest book I have ever read,it starts slow and you think that it's not scared and by the end of the book you will be looking under the bed and wanting to sleep with the lights on"
5505,jvud8f,8,"Have you read HP Lovecraft? Mostly short stories and such, but I think the cosmic horror thing is pretty neat."
5506,jvud8f,5,"Second this! It was recommended in another thread in this sub, and I don't regret buying it."
5507,jvud8f,4,This book was fucked up. My pulse went up significantly while reading some chapters.
5508,jvud8f,6,"The book was really just the inspiration for the series. It's a completely different story, set of characters, etc"
5509,jvud8f,3,"I couldn’t put this book down, even though I was very creeped out."
5510,jvud8f,4,"Me either, I loved it but I would not read it again, it is a bit of a slog at first but damn it's so good"
5511,jvud8f,3,"The movie was fine and all, definitely not the scariest movie out by a long shot. The book has a good pace and the story actually flows, without those random leaps you get in the movie."
5512,jvud8f,3,I haven’t seen the series but I really want to. But as u/tree_or_up said I’ve heard the book is totally different from the show.
5513,jvud8f,11,Dracula by Bram Stoker
5514,jvud8f,10,The Colour Out of Space is a short story by Lovecraft and it’s a must-read!
5515,jvud8f,3,"I own a copy of Ghost Story, and have tried and failed multiple times to read it all the way to the end. Still on my 'someday' list though. After so many false starts, I think I have memorized the damn grocery list of stuff they buy at the beginning though! 😅"
5516,jvud8f,7,"The genre is listed as horror on Goodreads 🤷‍♀️
I didn’t think it was scary, more creepy"
5517,jvud8f,5,"I was so impressed by Dracula, and I had no idea before I read it that the story was told through letters. I went into it just having an idea of Dracula as the Halloween vampire stereotype, and was shocked by how much I enjoyed the story."
5518,jvud8f,3,"Yeah it's a really slow book at first, and you keep asking yourself Why? and then you start putting 2&amp;2 together and then you start feeling uneasy and that feeling keeps building until someone says boo and you freak out, it's that kind of book"
5519,jvud8f,6,Hex! Forget the author but It was spooky af
5520,jvud8f,4,{{Her Fearful Symmetry}} is one of the creepiest and scariest books I've read! It starts off innocuous enough and ends up creepy af.
5521,jvud8f,3,Check out The Road by Cormack McCarthy.
5522,jvud8f,15,"N0S4A2 by Joe Hill (Stephen King's son, who IMO is a better horror writer) is my favourite book of the genre."
5523,jvud8f,3,"« Carrion Comfort » by Dan Simmons. Exceptional!
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion_Comfort"
5524,jvud8f,4,{{Those Across the River by Christopher Buehlman}} terrified me. Highly recommend!
5525,jvud8f,5,We Need to Talk About Kevin was deeply unsettling. I still think about how messed up the ending was.
5526,jvud8f,3,"Seconding the Exorcist, very unnerving. The audio book is read by the author himself and does a fantastic job"
5527,jvud8f,3,Thirded!
5528,jvud8f,3,Ania Alhborn is a fantastic female horror writer you should check out.
5529,jvud8f,3,Yep
5530,jvud8f,19,"If you want horror non-fiction, another great read is The Devil in the White City! It tells the story of serial killer HH Holmes alongside the history of the worlds fair in Chicago. Fascinating history, but the Holmes stuff is pretty appalling. And of course there’s also In Cold Blood"
5531,jvud8f,5,Oh Jaysus and the new movie!
5532,jvud8f,3,Goooooo! Do it now!!!!!
5533,jvud8f,6,"I would also recommend “The Deep” by the same author. It’s more body horror, but I still think about the descriptions years after I read it."
5534,jvud8f,3,"&gt;Ghost Story by Peter Straub 

This is the first time I've ever actually seen this recommended in a horror-request thread! It's super spooky!! The author is Thomas Olde Heuvelt."
5535,jvud8f,5,"the shadow over innsmouth is one of his longer stories (though it’s still pretty short) and it’s not necessarily terrifying, but i would say that reading it can be really unnerving."
5536,jvud8f,4,The movie was the scariest thing around when it came out. Some movie theatres started handing out barf bags because so many people became ill while watching it.
5537,jvud8f,3,"The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones has a supernatural element, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about this book since I finished it several weeks ago.

Into the Drowning Deep by Mira Grant is good if you want some sci-fi in your horror. I wouldn't say it's completely terrifying, but I thought it was really unsettling at times."
5538,jvud8f,3,"It's a scary movie but in old school style, but to my way of thinking is the best way"
5539,jvud8f,3,I've never been a fan of jump scares for the sake of jump scares or slasher movies. Give me that good old psychological or atmospheric horror every time.
5540,jvud8f,3,And that is certainly one of those
5541,jvud8f,5,Love Imajica!
5542,jvud8f,3,+1 for The Devil in the White City! It is fantastic and I re-read it a few times.
5543,jvud8f,3,"A great historical fiction and supernatural horror book is the Terror by Dan Simmons. It has a huge element of isolation horror, supernatural horror, and is based on the true story of the mystery surrounding the HMS Terror and HMS Erebus! It’s well written and there is also a show on Amazon prime based on the book!"
5544,jvud8f,3,Books of Blood by Clive Barker.  Lots of nightmares on those pages.
5545,jvud8f,3,"Out of curiosity, since I bought book of blood vol 1 just for the reason OP made this post - (besides the Hellraiser movies which are my favorite movies) has he done anything more truly disturbing than ""in the hills, the cities""  or was that already his literary peak as far as just fucked up and scary goes?

Btw please no spoilers(if you think something else by Barker is more fucked up than ""in the hills, the cities"" though point me in the right direction)

I'm done trying to right out this comment correctly I'm really tired ik it repeats itself :)"
5546,jvud8f,3,"I've read it 4 or 5 times and I never get bored. Easily one of the best books I've ever read, and one of the most terrifying."
5547,jvud8f,3,"Have you read Imajica? A lot of stuff in that book is way worse than in the hills....If not worse persae, just as fucked up in other ways. But I recommend Imajica too much as it is."
5548,jvud8f,5,I have never read anything like it prior or since. I considered myself fairly well read (probably not by this subs standards but at least in my own circles) and then I finished that and my brain had to redefine what fiction could do. I still struggle to recommend it as I have no idea how to summarize it without doing it a grave injustice. It’s something you just put in someone’s hands and say “we’ll talk when you’re done”.
5549,jvuq1k,12,The Jakarta Method by Vincent Bevins
5550,jvuq1k,10,Bob Woodward - [Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27514.Veil) is really interesting.
5551,jvuq1k,6,"Chalmers Johnson was a researcher who consulted for the CIA as well as producing original research on East Asia. 

His last three books are known as **The Blowback Series**. They are an extended study of the American Military-Industrial state, broader than your request but also documenting actions taken ‘on behalf of the American people’ as they say. 

These include: “[Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of the American Empire](https://books.google.com/books?id=6FcdYAAACAAJ&amp;dq=0805075593&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=abpJVPOQBMK1sQSh2YLIDQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ)”, “[The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic](https://books.google.com/books?id=MrV7dCG5S0YC&amp;dq=The+Sorrows+of+Empire:+Militarism,+Secrecy,+and+the+End+of+the+Republic&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)”, and “[Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic](https://archive.org/details/nemesislastdayso00john)”.

His last book was his vision of a way forward for the republic: “[Dismantling the Empire; America’s Last Best Hope](https://books.google.com/books?id=pEn3QwAACAAJ&amp;dq=chalmers+johnson)”.

IMO, he is one of the most important 20th Century historian/scholar/critics of American dirty tricks and their cost to the nation. You can learn more about him here: [Chalmer’s Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_Johnson)

5552,jvuq1k,6,I’m currently reading Edward Snowden’s Permanent Record. Very interesting so far!
5553,jvuq1k,4,"“A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror”

5555,jvuq1k,4,"Definitely. 
The author was shot by US Marshals on his own driveway."
5556,jvuq1k,4,"Tim Weiner wrote the history of the CIA. It's gotta be one of those books that really revealed to me how the world and power politics work. One of the most influential books I've read.

Then not directly about CIA but Chalmers Johnson wrote three books about the neocoloanialism of the US empire and how the military industrial complex functions. Blowback, Sorrows of the Empire and Nemesis are all in the Audible Plus library so you can have a listen for few bucks. 

The fact that that this stuff is so little talked about takes so much out of the political discussion. It's really morbid and depressing."
5557,jvuq1k,5,I've listened the Sorrows of Empire and Nemesis is almost finished. It's honestly really scary that the modern day imperialism is almost unknown even for many thinkers and well educated people. I'm not american so it boggles my mind how a nation can have just as much of an empire as the british did and basically everybody is ignorant about it.
5558,jvuq1k,3,"LMAO the Amazon product description says:

""Revised edition excludes the hateful forgery Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Had Mr. Cooper known it was a forgery, he would never have included it in his book."""
5559,jvuq1k,7,"I mean... the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was a forgery commissioned by the Tsarist 'Okhrana' police in Imperial Russia... this is well documented - why wouldn't they edit it because of that?? 

It reflects pretty poorly on the author that he thought it was a genuine text too, it's a pretty standard tropey ""international backroom conspiracy"" text with little in the way of substance."
5560,jvuq1k,9,"LEGACY OF ASHES is the most detailed, impeccably reported history of the CIA from the early days of the OSS to modern day (believe it was written during W Bush’s presidency). Absolutely fascinating and more than a little infuriating at some of the colossal failures the agency has in its history. I also enjoyed learning about the inherent difficulty of being a spy service in a democracy and the challenges of serving elected officials whose priorities don’t necessarily align with what the agency experts feel is the best course of action. Well worth the read even for a rather long book.

Edit: missing word"
5561,jvuq1k,4,Right? These should be basic reading for Americans as we spend massive resources propping up this empire-no-one-wanted(-except-Capital).

If you like more of a Viking feel, The Last Kingdom book series is amazing (better than the show). I'm currently reading some of The Dragonlance books if you like the D&amp;D vibe as well and they have been enjoyable, very Lord of the Rings-esque.  Hope that helps!"

I wasn't interested in book reading for two reasons firstly because of my poor eyesight(I hate spectacles) and secondly so lengthy books. But I loved what the words unfold from beginning till end. So I found a better solution ""Manhwas"" I just read them nowadays mainly because of illustration + wide and clear written content. I think that half of the imagination work will be replaced thanks to illustration images so how about try reading them. 

And also maybe the genre you read doesn't pique your interest how about trying a genre you haven't read before."
5574,jvwjrn,3,"Terry Pratchett wrote a couple of books intended for younger/young adult readers, Nation and Dodger, which I also think are just really, really good books. If you like those he wrote a ton of other stories, most in his fantasy setting of the Discworld, which you can dig into later. (I've read most of them and would be glad to offer specific suggestions when the time comes)

Judging by some of the titles you say you've read already though, I'd say you just need to find something that grabs your attention rather than something at a lower reading level. Here's a few I often recommend, mostly sci-fi or fantasy because that's what I typically read:

The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester: a bit like The Count of Monte Cristo in Space, a revenge tale with plenty of action, intrigue, and larger than life characters. Also much shorter and faster-paced than The Count of Monte Cristo.

The Redemption of Althalus: a lighthearted and easy-read stand-alone fantasy story starring the time-traveling thief and wizard Althalus putting together a team of heroes to battle the forces of the evil god Daeva.

Monster Hunter International by Larry Correia: Follows the adventure of Owen Pitt as he joins up with the secret paramilitary organization of the title and does battle with all the things that go bump in the night, sort of like Men in Black or X-Files with more guns."
5575,jvwjrn,3,Maybe try something shorter like Animal Farm or Jekyll and Hyde if you have trouble focusing. They’re both excellent books and quite easy to get through!
5576,jvwjrn,3,"Just reread The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky and it’s truly lovely if you haven’t read it before. Very simply written, but powerful."
5577,jvwjrn,3,"**If you're looking for a classic:** Of Mice and Men -- it is a short, simple story with compelling characters.

**If you're looking for literally anything:** I used to teach teenagers who struggled with reading, and they got a lot of enjoyment out of some of the books published by Orca Soundings -- they are simple, quick reads, but high-interest storylines.

**Tip 1:** Try to empathize with the characters -- pick at least one -- can be the main character or someone else -- to be ""you,"" and try to think about what you would do, say, feel, etc. if you were in the situations they were in. (They do NOT have to have anything in common with you in the surface to be ""you,"" just pretend your brain is in their body). Would you make the choices they make? Would you fare better or worse?

**Tip 2:** If the book has a lot of characters, make yourself a ""cheat sheet"" to keep them straight.

**Tip 3:** Try to predict what is going to happen next as you read."
5578,jvwjrn,3,"I recommend listening to audiobooks if you’re struggling to focus !  

Born A Crime by Trevor Noah is a very interesting and fun read. It’s an autobiography, the best one I’ve read so far. Especially good on audiobook since he reads it himself.  

I listen to audiobooks while I do anything, really, but it’s particularly nice to do it whilst solving a jigsaw puzzle."
5579,jvwjrn,3,"{Howl's Moving Castle} by Diana Wynne Jones! It is a wonderful read for all ages, full of fun, quirky characters, and lots of crazy adventures. Studio Ghibli made an anime film adaptation that captures the magic perfectly, too (:"

5581,jvwjrn,3,"I really recommend Freak The Mighty by Rodman Philbrick .

It was assigned reading for me (although at that point I had already read it) but nearly everyone liked the book. It’s a pretty quick read and fairly simple . (It’s a 7th grade reading level so like 12 and 13 year olds) and one of my favorites to be honest.  It has some coming of age vibes but also can tug at your heartstrings for some moments.


The Giver by Lois Lowry is also really good. And also short as well. It’s part of a series actually but even though I read all of the series and I did enjoy it I  don’t really think it’s necessary  in my opinion  to read all of them and The Giver can stand well on its own and is the best of the whole series imo.

As for reading tips , I don’t really have any. Sorry. I hope you enjoy these though!"
5582,jvwjrn,3,Freak the Mighty is AMAZING. Easy read but oh so wonderful and moving.
5583,jvwjrn,3,It really is. It’s one of the only books that genuinely made me tear up a bit. I absolutely love it and besides The Outsiders this is a book that about everyone at my school really loved and wanted to know what would happen next.
5584,jvyabt,5,"{{The Stranger}} by Albert Camus or {{Silk}} by Alessandro Baricco

Both novels are quite short but well written."
5585,jvyabt,12,"The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead

Just the right length. No wasted words. Tight storytelling"
5586,jvyabt,8,"the haunting of hill house. sometimes it seems like it's dragging, but when it gets ""going"" you see that not one single word was a waste of time"
5587,jvyabt,11,Of Mice and Men
5588,jvyabt,3,"Certainly “The Art of the Novel”, by Milan Kundera. It’s not a story book, it’s more theoretical in a lyrical way. This book will guide you through the art of novel and give you a new point of view about the books you read and what you can get from them, and it’s not boring AT ALL!"
5589,jvyabt,8,"Slaughterhouse v

Or lord of the flies"
5590,jvyabt,3,{{The Alchemist}}
5591,jvyabt,3,"The Little Prince. It’s the perfect length, in my opinion. I feel anything longer would have taken away from the beauty of it... but then, most of my memories with this book are only possible because it’s a two or three hour read the first time around."
5592,jvyzxd,7,"The Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater! I will never be able to recommend it enough. Strong female lead, LGBTQ+ representation, hilarious, wholesome, dark, unlike anything you'll ever read. It's four books of friendship dynamics and dead Welsh kings. I have never read a book with more loveable characters. The prose and sharp humor will slap you in the face for directly opposite reasons. I have not heard the audiobooks, but I *have* heard they are marvelous."
5593,jvyzxd,4,"It sounds like you would probably enjoy Ursula K. Leguin's Earthsea series if you haven't read it already, seems like it would match up well with your list. I've only read the fist two so far but I've thoroughly enjoyed them.

Jim Butcher also has a second more traditional fantasy series under the collective title of the Codex Alera. Once again, only read the first couple but they were enjoyable. If you dug his Dresden series it might be worth at least looking into.

Some of my personal favorite series include:

The Deathstalker series by Simon R. Green, a slightly tongue-in-cheek space opera series that reads like what would happen if Star Wars went off its meds. You've got psychic powers, swordfights and rayguns, scheming noble houses, rogue AI, horrible alien monsters, and a hero who really doesn't want to deal with any of it accompanied by a varied and cool cast of supporting characters. Five-book main series with a three-book sequel series.

The Belgariad/Malloreon series by David Eddings, a somewhat uncomplicated but nevertheless charming and enjoyable epic fantasy very much in the tradition of Lord of the Rings. Ten books total. Also, Eddings has another series bundled as the Elenium and the Tamuli which is overall just as good and is six books long.

The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisen, a harsh and gritty fantasy about survival on a world wracked by constant apocalyptic natural disasters and held under a merciless empire. Only three books, obviously, but some of the coolest fantasy I've ever read."
5594,jvyzxd,7,"Highly recommend
The Throne of glass series by Sarah J Maas, YA sci-fi/fantasy with a strong female lead and is 6 or 7 books long.

Or
A series of The Others (book 1 is titled Written in Red) by Anne Bishop. Sci-fi/fantasy, female MC, and I believe it is 5 books loong."
5595,jvyzxd,3,"**Alex Verus** series by **Benedict Jacka**, an ongoing urban fantasy series in the style of Dresden Files. Book 11 is coming out in a few weeks and then one book is left; **Nightside** series by **Simon R. Green**, a completed urban fantasy series with 12 books. Protagonist is male but his eventual love interest is a powerful bouncy hunter; and **Hawk and Fisher** series by **Simon R. Green** a complete medieval urban fantasy with 8 books. The protagonists are a couple."
5596,jvyzxd,3,The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch
5597,jvyzxd,3,"The Dune series is a great read. There’s a good amount of crossover between that fan base and Lord of the Rings/ Wheel of Time, so it might be in your wheelhouse."
5598,jvyzxd,3,"The Expanse series by James S.A. Corey, beginning with Leviathan Wakes. 9th and final book comes out 2021. I love the women in that series. All are badass in their own ways!"
5599,jvyzxd,13,"If you are a big fan of The Wheel of Time you should read Brandon Sanderson's books and the Cosmere in particular. There are different series but they are part of the same universe and they interlock into a single story. They are: Warbreaker, Elantris, Mistborn era 1 (3 books), and era 2 (3 so far), The Storm light Archive (4 books so far, each of them with more than 1000 pages), arcanum Unbounded, Dawnshard and White Sand ( a comic with 3 volumes so far). Hopefully I'm not forgetting any."
5600,jvyzxd,3,Highly recommend anything Brandon Sanderson has even breathed on. In particular the Mistborn trilogy. Would also really recommend the Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks- finished this really recently and I thought it was amazing.
5601,jvyzxd,3,Always going to suggest Discworld.
5602,jvyzxd,3,"I read the first three Mistborn books and loved them, but I didn't know it was part of a bigger series!"
5603,jvyzxd,7,"The Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas is really good magic, strong female MC. 

The Rivers of London series by Ben Aaronovitch is a police procedural with magic and river gods. 

A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness is only 3 books but still really good. 

Tamora Pierce has multiple series set in the same world. I would start with the Song of the Lioness Quartet."
5604,jvyzxd,3,"If you already read Mistborn era 1 I'd suggest to continue with era 2 (Wax and Wayne series), and then, in no particular order, Elantris, Warbreaker and White Sand. To continue with the first 3 of The Stormlight Archive and then Arcanum Unbounded and finish (for now) with the fourth book of The Stormlight, that was released today. That's my opinion at least. Maybe in r/cosmere you can find a better order."
5605,jvyzxd,6,I was thinking The Stormlight Archives and Warbreaker too. Definitely thick and with strong female characters.
5606,jvyzxd,3,Tamora Pierce is awesome! The Circle of Magic series would be my recommendation for her.
5607,jvzek3,17,"I like a lot of the books on your list!

How do you feel about Greek mythology? Circe by Madeline Miller might be something you enjoy.

Edit: also have you thought of rereading an old favorite? Sometimes when I'm going through a hard time or can't focus on something new, that's more engaging to me. For me I always default to Tamora Pierce books because I've loved them since I was a child but they still hold up. They're engaging and comforting because they're familiar, so something you've loved for a while might be good to return to."
5608,jvzek3,10,"Have you ever tried graphic novels?  If you liked American Gods, you may enjoy Neal Gaiman's Sandman series."
5609,jvzek3,3,I also like a lot of the books on your list! Have you tried anything by Lois McMaster Bujold? Her Pen and Desdemona novellas are short(er) and very engaging. They’re 100-200 page stories that are snapshots of the life of a man and his demoness.
5610,jvzek3,7,The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.
5611,jvzek3,3,Check out Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo
5612,jvzek3,14,"How about short stories? Jeffrey Archer, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King have good short story collections."
5613,jvzek3,3,"This book, and The Name of the Wind as mentioned in another comment, are the only two books thay have managed to hook me as an adult reader the same way books used to hook me as a kid.
But, as a scaredy cat, I must admit staying up to 5 am reading The Shadow of the Wind wasn't the smartest idea hahaha."
5614,jvzek3,4,Good idea.  I have had the same struggle this year so I started retreading The Lord of the Rings.  Went right through The Fellowship and am into the 2nd book now.
5615,jvzek3,4,"I recommend listening to audiobooks! Might be easier to focus if you hear the story instead of read it. It works better for me, at least."
5616,jvzek3,3,"I always recommend “We Were Liars” from E. Lockhart in that type of situation that seems like a “literary hangover” (it’s a brazilian expression, I don’t know if it fits in your country, but it’s when you can’t read anything), because it’s a simple book at the beginning and it gets more and more interesting and confusing till BOOM plot twist. What I’m saying is that the book don’t really need concentration at the beginning but catches you at the end, it gives time to you to get excited with it.

Hope it helps!"
5617,jvzek3,7,"I’d look into short stories and poetry, really nice to read in short bursts but not feel like you are chopping up a complex plot line too much. I don’t have a specific suggestion that I think you’d love, unfortunately, because I don’t have much overlap with what I tend to gravitate towards. This is just from experience from someone with ADHD who has had many long periods in my life where sitting for a long time to read felt impossible. 

Here are some I’ve enjoyed when I have a short attention span: 
The Woman Destroyed by Simone de Beauvoir 
The Trouble With being Born by EM Cioran
Existentialism is a Humanism by Jean Paul Sartre 
My Poems Won’t Change the World by Patrizia Cavalli

Also consider collections of essays like:
Norton Reader -lots of different editions
Essays in Existentialism  by Jean Paul Sartre 
(Or any philosopher you are interested in will likely have a collection of their essays)

I also like the idea of revisiting an old favorite that someone else mentioned! Requires a little less concentration."
5618,jvzek3,6,"I have also had a lot of trouble concentrating over the last few months, but when I have this problem I usually default back to mysteries. I'd recommend Tana French's Dublin Murders series - they're decently dark, but engrossing and well written. You also might try Louise Penny's Inspector Gamache series. They're not as well written, but are quite easy to escape into."
5619,jvzek3,5,Circe and her other book The song of Achilles were both so well written and such great books. Highly recommend.
5620,jvzek3,3,"I'd also recommend Bujold. Considering your eclectic list of favourites, she might just be an author who could fit on the list. The Vorkosigan Saga is a yearly reread for me."
5621,jw45kx,1166,Essentials of Pharmaceutical Chemistry 4th Edition didn’t sit well with me.
5622,jw45kx,252,"American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis is THE book that makes most people tap out at some point because of how visceral it gets.

Blindness by Jose Saramago has a very intense style, and also gets pretty damn intense in other ways."
5623,jw45kx,47,"I had to take breaks (long ones) after every chapter of American Psycho. Got through it, though, and glad I did."
5624,jw45kx,143,Thank you for the laugh lol this response is golden
5625,jw45kx,44,"I don't get too affected by written descriptions of horrible things (if the film had dared to depict the most explicit scenes from the book I definitely wouldn't have been able to watch), but the worst scene (you know the one I mean) had me reevaluating my reading choices for a while. But I agree, I'm glad I read it, it's unique."
5626,jw45kx,26,The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins was really good but made me uncomfortable in several places.
5627,jw45kx,14,"&gt;had me reevaluating my reading choices for a while

Damn now I'm really excited to get the book and read it!"
5628,jw45kx,11,"I second this book as being a great book, but don't remember it leaving me uncomfortable in the slightest."
5629,jw45kx,9,"John Dies at the End and the sequel - Book is full of spiders - are my favorite horror books, and pretty disturbing at times.

The Troop is also skin crawling body horror. Highly suggest it."
5630,jw45kx,26,"Yeah, totally. I had to keep checking in with myself to make sure I still wanted to have all of that in my head. But it’s so well-written—and the author says he didn’t actually invent anything, he found all the accounts of violence in the news. So it’s an accurate portrayal of the U.S., in a way."
5631,jw45kx,9,Without giving away anything there were several instances of violence and the golden cow bbq and the “dead girl” were pretty uncomfortable. I’m not a prude in the slightest but I did get the willies from some of that
5632,jw45kx,278,"Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk

A collection of short stories set within a larger story.

The 1st short story *Guts* was known to make a few people pass out when he gave live readings."
5633,jw45kx,37,Rant by Chuck Palahniuk stayed with me for awhile. Really any of his books.
5634,jw45kx,19,"although written very poorly and immaturely, hard not to be disgusted by Cows or The Wasp Factory. American Psycho is also one of my favorite novels ever written and can’t recommend it highly enough"
5635,jw45kx,9,Goth by Otsuichi disturbed me a lot. Had to take a lot of breaks with it.
5636,jw45kx,5,"Poliu by Louis Barthas. While most of its boring, one point in the book he describes the feeling of getting burned by a German flamethrower and what happened to the people around him, it was horrific. Another point in the book he tries to dig people out of a collapsed dugout, he saves one but has to shovel mud out of the guys mouth and nose. He was assigned to retrive the bodies in the actual room of the dugout and digs for hours, he reaches the main area and finds three people with their heads crushed and caved in due to the concussion and pressure of a shell landing on the roof of the dugout. He needed four or five people to carry one body due to their bones and body being pulverized. I had to take a week off from reading this book, but if your interested in reading disturbing war memoirs, this would be the best."
5637,jw45kx,10,"Haven't read it all, but I've been looking for similar books and came across one called ""Hogg."" It's a little obscure but easy to find online. I opened it up to a random chapter and read a bit and can confirm that it is quite horrible. 

I'm at work and feel gross typing out a synopsis so I'll let you Google it for yourself."
5638,jw45kx,7,"If You Tell: A True Story of Murder, Family Secrets, and the Unbreakable Bond of Sisterhood. By Gregg Olsen."
5639,jw45kx,30,{Tampa} is for sure one of the most messed up books I’ve ever read.

&gt;It wasn't that she didn't love her children. She did. But there was a fortune at stake—a fortune that would assure their later happiness if she could keep the children a secret from her dying father.

^(By: Osamu Dazai, Donald Keene | 176 pages | Published: 1948 | Popular Shelves: fiction, japan, japanese, classics, japanese-literature | )[^(Search ""No Longer Human"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=No Longer Human&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human, this leading postwar Japanese writer's second novel, tells the poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. In consequence, he feels himself ""disqualified from being human"" (a literal translation of the Japanese title).
&gt;
&gt;Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, The Setting Sun, has said of the author's work: ""His world … suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, … but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book."" His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.

5697,jw45kx,4,I second this! I read it over the course of a few weeks because it was too exhausting to read a lot more than two or three “routines” in a day. It definitely messed with me and stayed with me for a long time. It’s also one of those books that gets even better after you’ve finished it and let it sink in for a while. I‘ve picked it multiple times since I‘ve read it just to read certain passages again.

&gt;In a memoir hailed for its searing candor and wit, Alice Sebold reveals how her life was utterly transformed when, as an eighteen-year-old college freshman, she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. What propels this chronicle of her recovery is Sebold's indomitable spirit - as she struggles for understanding (""After telling the hard facts to anyone, from lover to friend, I have changed in their eyes""); as her dazed family and friends sometimes bungle their efforts to provide comfort and support; and as, ultimately, she triumphs, managing through grit and coincidence to help secure her attacker's arrest and conviction. In a narrative by turns disturbing, thrilling, and inspiring, Alice Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims even as she imparts wisdom profoundly hard-won: ""You save yourself or you remain unsaved.""

But as for the topic, it's a ""love"" story between an adult and a child, so that's the content. But you aren't disgusting for reading it. Don't let anyone tell you that. Not reading something because you heard it has certain things in it is just a way to remain ignorant. Things exist in the world, and understanding them might help combat them.

5760,jw45kx,5,"This is a really cool topic/thread.  I think the only one for me would be A Clockwork Orange (I was still a little young.)

5770,jw45kx,14,Same. Never read another one of his books again. I was looking for a ghost story. The name fooled me greatly.
5771,jw45kx,3,I read Maribou Stork Nightmares a few months ago. I had to follow that shit up with Anne of Green Gables.
5772,jw45kx,3,That happens to be one of my favorite short stories 🙈
5773,jw45kx,4,I was legit just thinking about mentioning this book as I read this post.
5774,jw45kx,13,"It should be pointed out the story only becomes more horrible from that point onward. It is very well written, but it is not a story you will forget, and something of a warning about making life that hates as we do."

5777,jw45kx,5,"Yeah, I kinda just shrugged off her opinion because she admitted to not reading it, but hated it because of her hatred of pedophiles (she told me that she suffered sexual abuse as a kid) and heard that it romanticized it (which again, I'm still not sure if that's true), so I feel like her own biases contributed to her telling me that.

Regarding 11/22/63, damn is it long. It's probably the longest book I've read since I read Anna Karenina 4 years ago, and that took me a month! Thankfully, I'm going to spend most of my Thanksgiving weekend trying to read it and try and finish it off by early December. I think I'll read Good Omens until my winter break starts, and I'll read The Demon-Haunted World and Lolita over break."
5778,jw45kx,6,Is there a movie adaptation of this? I wanted to watch The Girl Next Door (with Elisha Cuthbert) and ended up watching *The Girl Next Door* which was not at all the same thing and very disturbing. I got way too far into it before realizing I was watching the wrong movie and just ended up finishing it. Definitely traumatizing.
5779,jw45kx,3,I've read some f'd up books but Hogg made me feel dirty after finishing it. If I had bought a physical copy I wouldve burnt it.
5780,jw45kx,3,I have no idea if I want to see that! wow. Thank you.

&gt;Carl Streator is a reporter investigating Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for a soft-news feature. After responding to several calls with paramedics, he notices that all the dead children were read the same poem from the same library book the night before they died. It's a 'culling song' - an ancient African spell for euthanising sick or old people. Researching it, he meets a woman who killed her own child with it accidentally. He himself accidentally killed his own wife and child with the same poem twenty years earlier. Together, the man and the woman must find and destroy all copies of this book, and try not to kill every rude sonofabitch that gets in their way. Lullaby is a comedy/drama/tragedy. In that order. It may also be Chuck Palahniuk's best book yet.

Honestly though, I’d remember it being more the way it was written and the normally innocuous setting ( I used to go swimming a lot as a kid, never thought about THAT) that freaked me out the most. I’ll only say that.

Edited: I just googled to make sure I got the story right, it’s been probably 20 years since I read it so wasn’t sure. I think the worst part for me was the pool, but there are other parts that I thankfully don’t remember. Then I stopped reading because I didn’t want to go through it again. Ugh."
5785,jw45kx,6,In a different vein but A Little Life is very disturbing. It's basically trauma porn the whole way through. One of my favorite books but definitely made me sick to my stomach and extremely emotional at times.

5797,jw45kx,10,"This book is constantly being recommended to people who want “a book that'll totally fuck me up for days,"" or along those lines. I thought, wow, this must be absolutely brutal, so let's see what it's all about.

I didn't read the Wikipedia entry, only the brief summary and being aware that it's based on a true story. While reading I'm usually very stone-faced and rarely verbally exclaim something, whether funny or sad, but this book had me muttering ""oh my god"" and ""are you fucking serious"" in disgust multiple times. I credit that to Ketchum for weaving such a detailed vision of the vile acts that this poor girl was enduring, but I also blame these sick monsters who got away with it."
5798,jw45kx,5,"Fascinating is a word for it. 

There isn't a more succinct word for ""the feeling that you get when you see the corpse of some family's dog in the road"", but that would be more fitting"
5799,jw45kx,8,Lolita is a great book about a bad person. The book is very good.
5800,jw45kx,8,"It's written from the perspective of the molester, so that's why people try to claim it's glorifying pedophilia. It's not. You have to keep in mind the book itself isn't the same thing as its main character. The book doesn't glorify the act, and Nabakov's own explanation about the book show that he doesn't agree with Hubert's actions and beliefs.

Though I wouldn't recommend your friend to read it because it may be triggering for her personally. Good Omens is great too! You've got a nice list for the next few months, Enjoy!"
5801,jw45kx,13,I read this. I do not like horror or horror adjacent books. It was disturbing and beautiful and thoughful
5802,jw45kx,4,I also read this one when a friend was reading Haunted in high school. The pool is definitely the worst part. Will likely never read another Palahniuk again!
5803,jw45kx,39,"It's about a bunch of aspiring authors who go on a writing retreat. &gt;!They get locked in an abandoned theater with enough supplies to last them through the retreat, but they all start sabotaging things because they think it'll make a better story.!&lt; Then most of the book is various short stories written by each of the authors. All dark and quirky, usually some gore or violence. Par for the course for Palahniuk, tbh.

Guts is one of the short stories. &gt;!The narrator tells you a bunch of depraved stories about masturbation. Sounding with candle wax, for example.

5804,jw45kx,3,"Blood Roots by Richie Tankersley Cusick it’s a gothic horror I stumbled across in my library in High School and let me tell you the plot is shocking. A curse that involves cannibalism, mutilation, and incest not to mention the racism and abuse (mental/physical it’s got it all) which is a common theme throughout. Oh don’t forget the incest threesome in the mausoleum! 

Also there’s Death Instinct by Bentley Little about a murderer running rampant killing people all throughout the city. One guy get his dick cut off and shoved down his throat while a different person gets her orifices sewn closed and legs/arms chopped off to be switched on the opposite sides (left on right and vice verse) then sewn back on. Oh did I mention the murderer is a little mentally retarded kid whose mom made him with his mentally retarded dad that she keeps tied to a bed so she can fuck him whenever she wants? 

I had a bad habit of stumbling across freakishly outlandish books a skill of mine that has never failed me (unfortunately)"

That at the end of the world, literally, as everything was blinking out to absolute darkness, there was still this spark of tenderness and absolute love between the father and the son. “If he is not the word of God, God never spoke.” I’m not a father but that’s still one of the most powerfully moving lines I’ve ever read"
5815,jw45kx,3,I came here to make sure this had been mentioned! So gruesome and florid with detail.
5816,jw45kx,5,I read half the book while sunbathing in a July or August. I had boughts of feeling cold and surrounded by darkness. I would look up from time to time and actually was startled when remembering where I was. His writing is so immersive it’s frightening.

Especially the &gt;!time he gets two 10 year old girls drunk and rapes them!&lt; and it’s just a paragraph explaining it with a punny joke thrown in there.  I had to step back and reevaluate what I just read.
5825,jw45kx,6,For the first section of the book I fully fell for the charm of Humbert because he describes everuthing so beautifully and is just really charming. Then I read a line on one of the last pages of it where he says something about how he had had sex with her multiple times in one morning so the duvet needed making. I then read back and realised that Lolita is just a normal average girl who he has become obsessrf with and up to that point it was just a paedophile driving her round cheap crappy attractions and raping her in dingy motels.

5833,jw45kx,3,"I was looking for someone to mention this! There’s a particular part of that book that makes me feel physically sick which doesn’t happen often. If you’ve read it, you can probably guess which part I’m talking about lol"

5838,jw45kx,15,"Anytime I hear about people not being able to read a certain horror book, I assume graphic rape scenes or something along the lines of your comment, which I find to be very cheap ""horror"".

If you can make a scary book that genuinely unsettles people and makes them check underneath their bed for the boogeyman before going to sleep, then you're a good horror writer."
5839,jw45kx,3,"Thank you. That was a very helpful synopsis that managed not to be as gross as the book presumably is. I don’t have a very long “never read” list, but this is now on it."
5840,jw45kx,3,"Definitely not that kind of humor. It's more of a sick and twisted version of irony that pervades all of his writing. Hard to describe, but so unique and dark"

I haven't read this one, but I collect this series when the ebook versions get discounted (also available in paper), and I've bought and enjoyed the volumes for the Celtic and Nordic folktales so far, and they've been steadily adding other places like India and Japan, so maybe they'll do a West Africa volume someday.

If you do ebooks, it's currently available in the “Humble Book Bundle: Be the Change Supporting the American Library Association” charity offer over at the Humble Bundle website (I don't think I can direct link, sorry, since Automod deletes store stuff, but it should be easy enough to find), which has a selection of several dozen black history and fiction interest books from major publishers and small presses for all ages for under $25 for the highest tier. You may also be interested in award-winning sf/fantasy author Nalo Hopkinson's collection _Falling in Love with Hominids_, which has stories which incorporate Afro-Caribbean folklore, which is in the bundle.

Penguin Random House has under their Pantheon imprint “The Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library” series with volumes collecting tales from various cultures around the world. There's _African Folktales_ and _African-American Folktales_, both edited by Roger Abrahams, and award-winning fantasy author and noted folklorist Jane Yolen has edited _Favorite Folktales From Around the World_ which says it includes some African tales as well. I haven't read these, but I've read and enjoyed others of Yolen's collections and anthologies, and she's pretty high quality and usually more an accessible popularizer than a scholar.

There's also _The Annotated African American Folktales_ edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr. &amp; Maria Tatar, which is a bit more off-topic, but the blurb says it also includes a few introductory African tales and there's essays discussing how stuff got adapted to the New World and lingering influence and such, if you're interested. I haven't read this, but I've gotten others in publisher W. W. Norton's Annotated Books series, and they're really very well done, IMHO, and mostly meant for a general reading audience."

&gt;Brace yourself for the most astonishing, challenging, upsetting, and profoundly moving book in many a season. An epic about love and friendship in the twenty-first century that goes into some of the darkest places fiction has ever traveled and yet somehow improbably breaks through into the light. Truly an amazement—and a great gift for its readers.
&gt;
&gt;When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity. 
&gt;
&gt;Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.

&gt;Set in Los Angeles in the early 1980's, this coolly mesmerizing novel is a raw, powerful portrait of a lost generation who have experienced sex, drugs, and disaffection at too early an age, in a world shaped by casual nihilism, passivity, and too much money a place devoid of feeling or hope.
&gt;
&gt;Clay comes home for Christmas vacation from his Eastern college and re-enters a landscape of limitless privilege and absolute moral entropy, where everyone drives Porches, dines at Spago, and snorts mountains of cocaine. He tries to renew feelings for his girlfriend, Blair, and for his best friend from high school, Julian, who is careering into hustling and heroin. Clay's holiday turns into a dizzying spiral of desperation that takes him through the relentless parties in glitzy mansions, seedy bars, and underground rock clubs and also into the seamy world of L.A. after dark.

The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers - not a happy book, but I had never identified more with someone’s loneliness before. A quote from the book: “The way I need you is a loneliness I cannot bear.” However, this book contains a suicide. So if you’re not in the right headspace for that then don’t read it, or put it off.

In the Distance by Hernan Diaz - this is a western about a Swedish guy who gets seperated from his brother on the journey to America during the gold rush, and he’s trying to find him  but he doesn’t speak any English. Perfectly captures the feeling of loneliness.

If you’ll read YA, Adib Khorram’s books Darius the Great is not Okay, and Darius the Great Deserves Better have a main character who lives with depression - it doesn’t overtake his life, but it can occasionally really mess with him. In other words, a perfectly normal person.

*The Enchanted April* by Elizabeth von Arnim. It's just lovely.

*The Martian* by Andy Weir. Very funny sci-fi, and just suspenseful enough.

The Mrs. Pollifax books by Dorothy Gilman, starting with *The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax*. Spy novels for people who like cozy mysteries. Mrs. Pollifax is such a charmer and her attitude is lovely.

Similarly, the Amelia Peabody books by Elizabeth Peters, starting with *Crocodile on the Sandbank*. Imagine ""Murder, She Wrote"" crossed with Indiana Jones.

&gt;Matt Haig’s accessible and life-affirming memoir of his struggle with depression, and how his triumph over the illness taught him to live.
&gt;
&gt;Like nearly one in five people, Matt Haig suffers from depression. Reasons to Stay Alive is Matt’s inspiring account of how, minute by minute and day by day, he overcame the disease with the help of reading, writing, and the love of his parents and his girlfriend (and now-wife), Andrea. And eventually, he learned to appreciate life all the more for it.
&gt; 
&gt;Everyone’s lives are touched by mental illness: if we do not suffer from it ourselves, then we have a friend or loved one who does. Matt’s frankness about his experiences is both inspiring to those who feel daunted by depression and illuminating to those who are mystified by it. Above all, his humor and encouragement never let us lose sight of hope. Speaking as his present self to his former self in the depths of depression, Matt is adamant that the oldest cliché is the truest—there is light at the end of the tunnel. He teaches us to celebrate the small joys and moments of peace that life brings, and reminds us that there are always reasons to stay alive.

&gt;Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man's Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.

5908,jwf8wl,18,I loved Darius the Great is not Okay. Magical story
5909,jwf8wl,3,"Hang in there, friend.  It will get better.  

You're having a lot of negative thoughts right now.  I highly recommend The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  It's all about staying in the moment and out of your ego/pain body."
5910,jwf8wl,7,"hi .. I understand what you’re going through I don’t have some crazy meaningful book but honestly if your looking for a long read with amazing characters and a wonderful story about life, overcoming trauma, and diversity

 PLEASE read the House Of Night novels by P.C. And Kristen Cast .. 

They’re really good books that follow a group of vampires from teen years to young adults, but it’s not like twilight or anything like regular vamp novels it is based in the real word and has a lot of themes that represent issues I’ve also struggled with and has a lot of relatable characters who grow and change throughout the books, as well as it changes perspectives between characters so you don’t get bored too easily . 

Just give it a thought ."
5911,jwf8wl,3,"Hey OP, I am so sorry to hear about what ypu are going through. It must be really hard getting through the days. I could tell you that I’ve been there, but that doesn’t lessen the pain. Just like many suggested, I urge you to seek help. There is nothing to lose, on the contrary, it could help you :) 
As per book suggestion, it might sound counter-intuitive; but a few years back I was seriously considering suicude, so I read Goethe’s {{The Sorrows of Young Werther}} and it made me realize how pointless all that was, and by acting it out it wouldn’t really make me feel any better. Because, at least for me, I didn’t resent life but the bad feeling itself. So, reading that book kinda gave me a push to at least try to enjoy things. 

I hope you find your light OP, this world needs good people :)"
5912,jwf8wl,10,I really enjoyed Midnight Library by Matt Haig.
5913,jwf8wl,47,"Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson.

It is a fantasy series about several broken characters and their journeys. Besides the awesome plot, the characters are very real imo, and it is comforting to see other people struggle in so many different ways"
5914,jwf8wl,20,Second this. Honestly anything by Matt Haig. I'm reading {{The Midnight Library}} right now.

&gt;Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?

Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.

5921,jwf8wl,6,"{{If You Feel Too Much}}

This is a book of essays by the founder of To Write Love On Her Arms, an organization to help those with addiction, depression, and self harm find hope and support. When I'm struggling with periods of depression, I will read his essays and feel less alone in my feelings and more hopeful that I will make it through. Couldn't recommend more!"
5922,jwf8wl,7,"If you ever end up in that place - yes, absolutely read this. Until then, just keep it in your list. Free of empty platitudes, and very, very, real and empathetic stuff.  
EDIT:  
Hi. I wrote this before my other comment - I agree with the reply below - if your thoughts are persistent and suicide seems attractive or you get those feelings? Now is the time, please read this first and forget everything else. This book is the right call."
5923,jwf8wl,28,"Damn. I remember when I read books to espace reality.
Now I'm too depressed to read and just lay around doing nothing or drinking when I can hide that.
The sad part isn't even the depression, it's that I work in a library. 

Maybe I should pick up a book again."
5924,jwf8wl,81,"So a lot of the books in this list are self help or about characters with depression. But I would like to take it in a different direction and say you need books that are unputdownable - ones that make you want to keep reading and then find more books like them and read those because they’re just really good books and you connect with them. 

Im a librarian and used to volunteer for a suicide hotline so I’d really like to help you find books you feel excited about. What’s your favorite genre and the last good thing you read or watched?"

5936,jwf8wl,3,"I’ve had that problem before, specifically last January. I’m not sure of specific books, but Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas actually helped me, specifically the third book. I know, that seems weird, how can a fantasy novel about an assassin help with depression? But the character does go through the same thing, and I found that helped.

I’ve been my happiest in years this month, after I started watching the show BBC Merlin. I know you’re asking for book recommendations, but seriously this show makes me so happy, that I actually feel alive again instead of simply like I’m surviving. Maybe it can help you, too, maybe it won’t, but I’ll recommend it anyways.

I also keep a journal, after I got really bad in January. It doesn’t feel like it helps, but given the turn around I’ve had this year, maybe it does. I start writing the bad, and end with the good. There is always good in a day, even if it is small. Perhaps this can help you too.

Please don’t give up. A song that helped me was “You Will Be Found” from Dear Evan Hansen. I broke down crying the first time I really got to listen, because it made me feel so much less alone. I highly recommend listening to it."

5942,jwf8wl,9,"The Book Thief — Markus Zusak

The Humans — Matt Haig

Stardust — Neil Gaiman


There’s something about these three books, while they’re all completely different, that makes me feel warm when depression takes that warmth away. I think it’s that all of them share an underlying theme of love, hope, and faith in others and yourself, all presented in such beautiful ways.

Stardust and The Humans are very light, playful, and sort of weird, but I never felt that they’re too “happy” when I’m in a depressive episode. The Book Thief is a sadder read, but has such a faith in humanity and is told so poetically that to me, it serves as a reminder of how small acts of love and kindness can make such a difference in the world."

5944,jwf8wl,8,"The book that saved me was Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. It has saved me many times from depression and despair.

Another is The Plague by Albert Camus if nihilism is more your style (often is in times of despair). Furthermore, Nietzsche’s shorter piece Genealogy of Morality can be useful for leaning out of societies values, so that we can lean back in on our own terms. That empowerment was really useful for my overcoming of despair and depression. 

I also recommended the School of Life’s videos on YouTube and Academy of Ideas. Both channels are based on further readings that might allow you to discover an approach to existence that works for you. 

Best of luck. We have to constantly answer a question: what our reason for continuing is. As we answer that question more, The easier it becomes. 

Art and ideas are powerful but so is therapy. Attacking despair from multiple angles is our best bet at getting a grasp over our lives. Best of luck. Feel free to DM me if you ever need to talk to someone."

So maybe it depends on why or when you’re reading it too. It’s not a book I suggest to most people though. But when someone is struggling I always remember what that did for me.

{{No Mud, No Lotus by Thich Nhat Hanh}}

“NO MUD, NO LOTUS Both suffering and happiness are of an organic nature, which means they are both transitory; they are always changing. The flower, when it wilts, becomes the compost. The compost can help grow a flower again. Happiness is also organic and impermanent by nature. It can become suffering and suffering can become happiness again.”



{{The Prophet by Khalil Gibran}}, specifically the chapter about joy and pain.

“Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.”"

What has helped me personally - everyone is different - is enjoying content that makes me laugh. I prefer standup specials, but if you want good books...

- Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams
- the Dirk Gently series, also by Douglas Adams

5980,jwf8wl,9,Unputdownable.  I'm adding that word to my vocabulary.  Also I look forward to seeing where this particular comment thread goes.
5981,jwf8wl,6,"In addition to unputdownable I would say a series that isn't finished yet. Looking forward to something like that has helped me in the past. ""Well I have to see what happens"" type thought process."
5982,jwf8wl,4,I would suggest Check Please! by Ngozi Ukazu (this is a graphic novel) And Beartown by Frederik Backman (tw sexual assault but this is one of my favorites). Both of these are coincidentally about hockey but like haikyuu you don’t need to know much about the sport to get into the story. Let me know if these dont look good and I can suggest some others.

5986,jwf8wl,3,J.Cole sooo good
5987,jwf8wl,4,"This. I could not recommend this book more to people struggling with their mental health. It’s a book about broken people learning how to put themselves back together and transform beyond the people that they used to be. It drives home the point that, even if you’re experiencing some of your darkest moments, you can find a way to come back from that. Two of the characters are dragging themselves from the depths of their own world-shattering experiences, and it’s something that many people can empathize with. Most of all, though, it demonstrates the power of having even the smallest bit of hope. I hope this book helps you, OP, because it helped me at a really dark time."

5991,jwhty2,7,I thoroughly enjoyed {Seveneves} by Neal Stephenson and the {Red Rising} series by Pierce Brown
5992,jwhty2,3,"I'm a big fan of Stephen King audiobooks. They are like listening to a movie the voice acting and writing is consistently so high quality.  I recommend the Institute, the Shining, and I just started 11/22/63.  I've worked out listening to them and easily get lost in the story while running etc. 

A podcast I'd recommend for your tastes is Hardcore History by Dan Carlin.  He does an incredible job of bringing history to life and goes deep on certain historical figures or wars that give a better 360 view of history compared to what we learn in school. 

Cheers to your healthier lifestyle!"
5993,jwhty2,3,"Both great.  Try Stephenson's Anathem, but listen at 1.25x speed.  It sounds better, and the book is super boring for a long time until it becomes amazing.  After 4 hours I sped it up because I thought it was going nowhere, after 8 hours I almost quit, but then it got awesome, and by the end I was almost ready to start it over.

Also, Children of Time and Children of Ruin, but don't listen back to back.  I like the sequel more but some people don't, I think it benefits from a little time off.  Good narration in the first, excellent in the second.  Or maybe I don't remember how good it was the first time, but Mel Hudson's work on Ruin definitely made an impression."

5998,jwhty2,9,"My favs: 

_Gentleman in Moscow_. Unhurried and fascinating, and everything pays off. Nicholas Guy Smith’s slightly European sounding accent is perfect. 

_Born a Crime_ written and read by Trevor Noah.  Our whole family loved it. 

David Sedaris is hilarious but intense. Technically he’s an essayist but I think of him as a stand up comedian who writes better than most. I can’t listen to him for more than 2-3 hours at a time, but he’s just right for a long walk or housekeeping.  Read by himself, _When you are engulfed in flames_, or anything written before that. 

I enjoy Science Fiction. The Bobiverse audiobooks are hilarious, especially if your the kind of person who has wished they could just be uploaded to live in a machine. 

Kim Stanley Robbins’ _New York 2140_ has a multi actor cast.  Climate change has NYC half underwater, and the haves and have nots make it work in creative ways. 

I enjoy a romantic comedy. Beth O’Leary’s _The Flatshare_ read by Kwaku Fortune and Carrie Hope Fletcher  was fun and has a novel premise. Having the POV chapters read by a corresponding reader gives it some radio theater vibe, and easily understandable but not American accents are fun for a change.  

Alt versions of Pride and Prejudice?  Soniah Kamal reading her own version, _Unmarriageable_, set in Pakistan. Is good on its own and clever in how it parallels the Jane Austen. 

_Very Valentine_ by Adriana Trigliani. Young woman in big Italian America family developing her career as a shoemaker. Unabashedly describes the pleasures of food, shoes, and romance.  

Julian Fellowes’s _Belgravia_ read by Juliet Stevenson.  Historical fiction with clash of classes by the guy who wrote Gosford Park and Downton Abbey."
5999,jwhty2,11,W(h)ill Wheaton does a phenomenal job narrating that book!
6000,jwhty2,18,The Harry Potter series narrated by Stephen Fry. Or Jim Dale. Both fantastic!
6001,jwhty2,5,Grover Gardner does a great read of The Stand!
6002,jwhty2,8,Jim dales version is excellent!
6003,jwhty2,8,"It's nonfiction, but ""Boys in the Boat"" is by far my most favorite audiobook. It's about the 1936 US Olympic rowing team. Edward Herrmann narrates. It's such a good story and his voice adds depth to it. Guy could read cereal ingredients and make it compelling."
6004,jwhty2,8,Michael Hall's narration of Pet Sematary is a close second to Weber's IT narration.
6005,jwhty2,4,Came here to say this. The narrator is fantastic. My only gripe is he mispronounces most of the local names. Would have taken 10 mins with a Washingtonian to learn.
6006,jwhty2,10,"Holy shit. 

My friend, if you like fantasy you are in for a treat. 

I recommend above all else The Stormlight Archives or Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.

BUT you have to listen to the ""graphic audio"" versions. Nothing else will suffice. It's like a movie in your mind (I believe that might be their slogan). 

Prepare for a level of entertainment that goes beyond the paltry movie releases of 2020 and welcome to some of the best storytelling and entertainment for your ear holes that you could possibly imagine."
6007,jwhty2,3,Second A Gentleman in Moscow!
6008,jwhty2,3,Jim Dale
6009,jwhty2,3,"It's a tie between these two for similar (but also different reasons) 

* Sadie by Courtney Summers
* Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid

Both of these were ""envisioned"" as audiobooks moreso than paper books. I think you miss out if you read them on book form instead of listening to them. 

The first is a parallel story of Sadie, a girl who is trying to find out what happened to her little sister who mysteriously disappears. The parallel story is told in podcast format, as someone who is also trying to figure out what happened to Sadie when she also disappears. It's really well done, kind of heavy, but super engaging. 

The second is reminiscent of the 80s and 90s MTV-Band-Interview format. You have the story of this band as told by the band members, long after they've split up. There's little nuances like them remembering details differently from one another, and stuff like that. It's wonderfully crafted. Taylor Jenkins Reid went out of her way to help cast the folks who'd be reading/narrating the audiobook, you get different voices for each character. Wonderfully executed!"
6010,jwhty2,4,Jim Dale also reads The Night Circus and he makes it equally as magical.
6011,jwhty2,3,Neil Gaiman reading Neverwhere or Stardust.
6012,jwhty2,3,"I have a hard time tracking characters talking and stuff like that so any full cast productions are great, imo - Dune and American Gods come to mind from Audible.

The GraphicAudio books are like 'movies for your mind' with full sfx, music, and full cast, but not everyone can get into those. They have basically all of Brandon Sandersons books, and they're amazing to listen to fully realized as they are - Especially Stormlight Archives."
6013,jwhty2,4,Gone Girl is great!
6014,jwhty2,4,Born a Crime is incredible!
6015,jwhty2,3,"I've learned that in audiobooks, the narrator is almost as important as the author.  I have been enjoying books narrated by Simon Vance - he has a fantastic voice, does accents - esp British accents extremely well, and could make the phone book sound interesting.

Specifically, I took up biking this year and while grinding up hills have been listening too:

Children of Earth and Sky and A Brightness Long Ago by Guy Gavriel Kay. 

Kay started out writing YA fantasy - the Summer Tree series. However, he has grown into a mature and sophisticated novelist who happens to write in the Fantasy genre.  These two books, set in set in a world inspired by Renaissance Italy are wonderful.  The writing is beautiful, the characters smart and interesting and complex, and the plots are compelling.  While there is magic, its use is subtle and the characters have to succeed - or fail - based on their wits and their ability to read the situation rather than by applying some overwhelming magic.

A second wonderful series - also narrated by Simon Vance, is Patrick O'Brian's extraordinary Master and Commander series. Often considered among the best adventure series ever written, the series is historical fiction based on the activities of two British naval officers during the Napoleonic wars.  Patrick O'Brian was one of the finest stylists to ever write in English.  Sure these books have sea battles and desperate escapes and shipwrecks - but they are best understood as the story of a wonderful friendship between two highly intelligent and equally highly admirable men - a British sea captain and his friend - a surgeon and intelligence officer.  These are people you would want to sit with all night, drinking port and just listening to their stories and to the love and banter that passes between them.

The Patrick O'Brian books have been recorded by multiple narrators - make sure you get one narrated by Vance."
6016,jwhty2,7,"The audiobook 11/22/63, my favorite Stephen King book, is 30.5 hours of amazing. It’s narrated by Craig Wasson and is everything I ever wanted in a book: nostalgic, suspenseful, emotional, fun and full of wonder. I have listened to it twice in five years, both times on the treadmill, it’s just that good."
6017,jwhty2,3,"

I actually came here to ask for book suggestions, but blocked by  the karama thing?  
Idk what the hell karama is i don't really use reddit  i don't even understand what the hell this website is it looks like the old forums i used to see in the 90's"
6018,jwhty2,3,"Phil Dragash did an ""unofficial"" unabridged audiobook for The Lord of the Rings series with full orchestra music and the likes. It was by far the best version of LoTR I've heard or read. 

You can find them on the Internet Archive, but be careful because some files are missing from the torrent version and if you play it in their we player it skips and the audio is jittery."
6019,jwhty2,3,"This might get downvoted, but I really, really like the Jim Dale versions of the Harry Potter books."
6020,jwhty2,4,"I came here to say this. I listened to the Jim Dale versions over the past couple years. I wish I had read or listened to the books at the time they were released since I was the appropriate age for the books at the time, but at age 35 I realize any age is appropriate for this masterpiece."
6021,jwhty2,5,"The Sandman, an Audible release. Dream, death, Desire, all personified in a number of short stories. Based on the graphic novel. So good I've listened 4 times now."
6022,jwhty2,4,"I'm gonna try to help you out a bit on the reddit concept/karma thing.

Karma is what you get for participating in discussion, simple as that. The more you comment and post, the more karma you'll get. However, if people disagree or don't like what you're saying/posting you'll be downvoted, which affects your karma negatively. If people like/agree with what you say, or think you've made a good point, they will upvote you and this will affect your karma positively. These are signified by the arrows on the left side of the comments and the overall site.

Reddit is meant to be a discussion forum. If you're not here to discuss, you're missing the point. The karma restrictions are typically in place in various sub reddits in order to deal with spam and bots, it can be annoying for new users, but it's better than the alternative. Typically this means you won't be able to make a new thread or submit a new post until you've commented and participated enough in other posts or threads. In other words, keep commenting and participating and eventually you'll clear the barrier of entry for the subreddit you were wanting to post in. 

I hope that helps."

6024,jwhty2,9,Gonna throw my hat in for the Stephen Fry version!
6025,jwhty2,5,No one is ever too old for Harry Potter :)
6026,jwhty2,3,I loved “good omens” as an audiobook. Neil Gaiman’s “Norse mythology” is delightful. Isabel allende’s “long petal of the sea” is beautiful and if you’re feeling particularly ambitious the biography of Frederick Douglass is 36hours but the narrator has a stunning voice.
6027,jwhty2,6,{{World War Z}} The cast is just stunning. Mark Hamill was my favorite.
6028,jwi09b,5,All of my friends are going to be strangers by  Larry McMurtry  is a good slutty man story
6029,jwi09b,3,*Oryx and Crake* by Margaret Atwood
6030,jwi09b,9,"In *Glamorama* by Bret Easton Ellis, the main character Victor is a himbo-extraordinaire. A male model, he is himbo enough to think *moi* is a person's name, brings his Vespa upstairs in the elevator and lacks intelligence/insight in pretty much any other way. It moves on from there, with an international terrorist organisation peopled by models driving Victor into a state of more self-awareness.

Pretty far removed from *Billy Budd* though ..."
6031,jwi09b,18,"Guards! Guards! by Terry Pratchett has the ultimate Himbo, named Carrot. I'm not sure if he continues in the rest of the side series (Nightwatch series?), but he's adorable and heartwarming."
6032,jwi09b,5,"Everyone always raves about *American Psycho*, but I think this is Ellis's best work."
6033,jwi09b,3,"You should see if you can get your hands on the Billy Mumphrey story. 

It's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and…unbridled enthusiasm. You see, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.

But definitely more of a mimbo than a himbo if that matters."
6034,jwi09b,3,"I was just about to suggest this, Carrot is sweet and naive and a great contrast from some of the other chatacters in the series.

I haven't read them yet but I know Carrot is in Men at Arms and Feet of Clay too, so I'm looking forward to getting to those"
6035,jwi09b,4,"The character that comes immediately to mind is Bertie Wooster, who's very handsome, very sweet, and very dumb."
6036,jwi09b,3,"Okay, fair. I’m inferring handsomeness from three pieces of evidence: 1, he’s constantly engaged; 2, he’s often the one being pursued, rather than the other way around; and 3, he’s played by Hugh Laurie, for Pete’s sake!"
6037,jwi09b,3,I am CACKLING
6038,jwkx6k,11,"Okay well the most common answer is going to be Wild by Cheryl Strayed, I bet. That book is great and definitely fits what you want. I've taught it and covered it in my podcast before. Excellent place to start! 

Lynn Hill was the first person to free climb The Nose in Yosemite, and her taunt that ""It goes, boys!"" is the ultimate hurrah for somebody who likes woman vagabond stories. There are other woman climbers out there that are good writers and dirtbags and who have written about their experiences.

Then there's stuff like Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Kimmerer. Pretty much every woman I've worked with in the outdoor field has read that book and loves it. I've read parts of it, and what I've read is really great, though I regret that I haven't read the whole thing.

Barbara Kingsolver has some good fiction about vagabond women -- The Bean Trees and Prodigal Summer. Maybe others?

For a Thoreau head, you could read Susan Fenimore Cooper's Rural Hours or Margaret Fuller's Summer on the Lakes. They fit into the Transcendentalist philosophy and were contemporaries of/inspirations for Thoreau, especially Cooper.

There's lots out there! These books don't get as much attention unfortunately, but these would be good starting places into a really fascinating world. This is off the top of my head. Happy to talk more or dig around in my bookshelf for other recommendations."
6039,jwkx6k,4,"Rosie Darling by Rosie Swale.
   
Full Tilt by Dervla Murphy.

Turkestan Solo: A Journey Through Central Asia by Ella Maillart."
6040,jwkx6k,4,"Thank you so much! I’ll look into all of these. I loved Braiding Sweetgrass and have avoided Wild admittedly due to the sort of negative attitudes toward it in my backpacking community. 

I have only heard of those two though, so I’m excited to dive into your recommendations! I think I’m most interested in Hill and Cooper to start."
6041,jwkx6k,3,The most on point recommendation I have is *Vagabonds* by Hao Jingfang - an SF novel by a Chinese woman about that very theme.
6042,jwkx6k,3,"I've always been split when it comes to Wild. As a backpacking teacher, I think it advocates for irresponsibility. I understand why the backpacking community doesn't like it. 

As an English teacher though, it's well written and the ideas are more complicated than they appear at first. I think it's good to think with, though it took me two reads before I warmed up to it.

Enjoy the others! Cooper is a blast."
6043,jwkxcg,9,"Basically the only books I love that I've never suggested are books I read as a kid, because 1) almost nobody asks for children's book recs and 2) I don't remember most of them. 

Loved the {{Trixie Belden}} series, though."
6044,jwkxcg,3,"*The Gift of the Deer* by Helen Hoover is a book I grew up on. It is, quite simply, a book about one family's personal interactions with the deer who came to their yard, mostly in the winters.

It was published in the late 60s or early 70s, and was one of the very few books adorning my shelf during my youth, when my family (and certainly not I) could not afford a visit to something so extravagant as a *book store* and I reread it often, mostly between trips to the public library during school breaks.

One of these days, I will knuckle down and pick up the electronic version (my paper copy is long gone)..."

Daydreams of Angels by Heather O'Neill: Collection of short stories that are a bit like fairytales.

(I'm not actually on this subreddit enough to tell what gets recommended a lot, sorry if these have come up before)"
6046,jwkxcg,13,"Does it count if I've suggested it in a different subreddit? I've suggested it on /r/ballet cause we were talking books on some thread, but it's not something that typically gets asked for here.

* Bunheads by Sofie Flack 

It's not exactly for everyone, it's a slice of life type of novel, about a pro ballet dancer in a new york city ballet company. It doesn't really appeal cause it's just kind of niche, and the author doesn't really shy away from using technical terms. I personally loved it.

Another one, I suggest this to all of my friends in real life when we're discussing job changes, but I found a lot of good insight in it, and I don't think I've seen it recommended here or asked for. Obviously non-fiction:

* Fearless Salary Negotiation by Josh Doody"
6047,jwkxcg,19,"**Regeneration** By Pat Barker - a wonderfully written haunting historical novel about soldiers in a psychiatric hospital after world war 1.

**Berlin Game** by Len Deighton - I loved this classic cold-war spy novel but don't see it recommended very much. 

**The Seventh Function of a Language** by Laurant Binet. If you like the wackier side of Vonnegut and Calvino, you might enjoy this thoroughly self-aware and thoroughly post-modern mystery/romp.

**Mysitc River** by Dennis Lehane. This is one of the best mysteries I've ever read but don't really see it recommended around these parts. 

**Cards on the Table** by Agatha Christie. There are a ton of AC recommendations here, but I never see this gem mentioned. Each character gives their own version of the events, giving the whole thing a rather cinematic flair."
6048,jwkxcg,27,"The Rapture of Caanan by Sheri Reynolds: a girl born into a religious cult gives birth to a baby. It’s creepy, weird, and I LOVED it.

God Don’t Like Ugly by Mary Monroe: I’ve only read the first book in this series, but it absolutely hooked me as a teenager. It’s about a young black girl, growing up in the sixties, who finds herself. It’s queer, a coming of age, and it has a segment about the Kennedy assassination that broke me for some reason. This book has stuck with me for years. 

Seraphina by Rachel Hartman: this one is YA. It’s not for everyone, since it has some cerebral, confusing elements. You have to read to understand what I’m referring to. This is a dragon fantasy with a beautiful love story. The main character absolutely broke me and I cried several times throughout. I read this as an adult.

ETA: I didn’t say much about the first one because it’s best to go into it blind."
6049,jwkxcg,6,"Carter Beats the Devil is a great book. Mixes history, magic, and early San Francisco

The Sisters Brothers is a weird Western-style novel but a fun read.

The Throwback Special is a fun but odd read about a group of guys who get together to reenact the play where Joe Theismann broke his leg."
6050,jwkxcg,9,"{{The Book of Strange new things by Michael Faber}}. Came across it because it was mentioned a couple of years ago in the Financial Times fiction books of the years. Haven't seen this here yet, but I might be wrong."

6055,jwkxcg,23,"Love Medicine by Louise Erdrich - interwoven short stories about Ojibwe families in the Midwest. So beautiful. 

The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes - it’s literary horror. So scary, so well-written. 

Priestdaddy by Patricia Lockwood - one of the funniest books I have ever read. A memoir by a woman who grew up in an eccentric family. Truly hilarious."

6057,jwkxcg,3,"First, They Erased Our Name by Habiburahman - a memoir by a Rohingya Myanmar Muslim refugee (who actually arrived in Australia before that big flight of 200 000 people a couple years ago).

YA that was such a cool story, awesome characters, hella fun but dealt with some serious topics - Dread Nation, and its sequel Deathless Divide by Justina Ireland. Zombie story that takes places during the Reconstruction era after the American Civil War.

A Common Wind by Julius S. Scott - a history of how black populations (free born, manumitted and enslaved) in the Caribbean exchanged information in the 18th century. Really niche topic that was extremely fascinating and one of the most well-written books I’ve ever read."

6060,jwkxcg,5,"Seraphina is fantastic for a few reasons, not least because the setting was so rich I felt like I was there, and having a little bit of tech added a lot of color."
6061,jwkxcg,4,"The Colony of Unrequited Dreams by Wayne Johnston. A fictional account of the province of Newfoundland leading up to its confederation with Canada in the 1940s. Very well-written, wonderful characters, and is a good look at a part of history that most people don’t know about. 

The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse by Louise Erdrich. It’s about an elderly priest who has served an indigenous community for many years, while hiding the fact that he is a woman (not a spoiler, it’s in the blurb). 

The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne by Brian Moore. I found this book kind of bizarre and almost embarrassing to read, but in a good way. It’s about a deeply lonely, borderline delusional older woman with a secret inner life."
6062,jwkxcg,7,"Satan: His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler J.S.P.S. 

VERY funny book about a psychotherapist who ends up treating Satan himself. Book was well-written and very interesting. Would not recommend if you want a happy story. Also critical of Christianity, if that’s a turn off for you."
6063,jwkxcg,3,I'll definitely be giving Bunheads a read. I started adult ballet classes this year and am loving it so far. Do you have any other suggestions for ballet books?
6064,jwkxcg,5,"Oh yay! I hope you keep at it! Ballet is one of the biggest joys in my life.

I don't have any fiction that I've personally read aside from *Bunheads*. But *Cantique* was suggested on that thread as well. There's also the new Misty Copeland book that came out recently, also called *Bunheads*. But like I said I haven't read these two, I'm just aware of them/they're on my list.

As to non-fiction:

* The Vanagova book: *Basic Principles of Classical Ballet* is a must read if you're hoping to really learn technique. It's cheap and short, worth every penny and time spent with it.
* There's also *101 Stories of the Great Ballets* which I've only partially read, they're 101 after all!
* *Bolshoi Confidential* which is a non-fiction history of the Bolshoi Ballet, and all its dancers, and it's full of dramaaaaa. 
* Lastly, *Classical Ballet Technique* by Gretchen Warren. It is just tremendously helpful in trying to understand the technique and learning the movements correctly. It comes with clear pictures illustrating good vs. bad technique. It's good reference material for sure."

6066,jwkxcg,3,"Thank you so much! I'm really enjoying it so far, which is not something I've ever said about any physical activity before.

6068,jwkxcg,3,The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne
6069,jwkxcg,10,"I used to love the Dragonriders of Pern! I don’t think I’ve ever seen it suggested here, but they’re good adventure stories. The premise is that interstellar refugee humans settled on a planet with dragons, who they team up with to protect the world from Threadfall. It’s been so long now that I don’t remember what Thread did exactly, but I remember enjoying the low-tech scifi dragon stories.

Also, A Wrinkle In Time is good fun. It has a cozy feel, one of those “kids on a fantasy mission” books. I like how it blended our world with other mystical adventures.

Eon and Eona - a duology that I really enjoyed as a preteen. Girl disguises herself as a boy to become a DragonEye, who wields the mystical powers of Eastern-type dragons. Had the first  unmistakably trans character I ever encountered.

The Dragon Keeper series also enchanted me, years ago. Young girl is tasked with watching out for an ancient eastern dragon."
6070,jwkxcg,5,"Oh man, I read this book as a teenager a couple of decades ago and thought it was the bee's knees. I hadn't thought about it in forever. I love that I remember that J.S.P.S. stands for ""Just Some Poor Schmuk.""

I think there's an intuitive case to be made that there's both a homogenizing and a diversifying effect. But I think you're right that if we're all just constantly recommending the same small set of books, the net impact is going to be to homogenize. Which probably isn't all that great."

All the other books by the same author I've read are terrible &amp; not at all well written. I can't stand the author or at least her public persona. The combination of disliking the author &amp; her other works keeps me from often recommending it. I'll have to work on that. It is a great book. It was made into an amazing movie too with Hilda Swinton, John C. Reilly, &amp; Ezra Miller."

6098,kf8hbe,22,I’m too scared.... but I was also scared of Monte Cristo and I fucking LOVED that
6099,kf8hbe,3,The Diviners and A Jest of God by Margaret Laurence. I read The Stone Angel as a teenager and thought I disliked Laurence's writing. I absolutely loved the other 2 books!
6100,kf8hbe,8,“Tuesdays with Morrie” by Mitch Albom
6101,kf8hbe,9,"Hotel.  
Not a big book. But some 4 years ago a guest at the hotel I work at told me I should read it. So I found it in English (I speak Spanish) and tried to read it a couple of times but fell asleep hopelessly each time lol.  
So now I had a lot of spare time I finally gave it a go and I quite liked it. It took me 4 years!"
6102,kf8hbe,49,"Emma by Jane Austen! I have had it forevvvver, it’s one of those classics that you have kicking around, and I just finally read it and LOVED it!!"
6103,kf8hbe,15,The God of Small Things. I've had it since I was 13 but I read it only a couple of years ago. Absolutely regret all the re-readings I have lost.
6104,kf8hbe,9,Book 2 might be my favorite. Enjoy!
6105,kf8hbe,17,Edmond Dantes says to escape the fear that has imprisoned you and to seek the treasures found within the pages of Dune.
6106,kf8hbe,33,"Harry Potter. It was overly popular and anything popular repulses me, as if I don't trust mass people. But it was amazing! It was so comfortable to read! An escape from the pain of existence. 
Another one would be To Kill a Mockingbird. I had no idea what it was about, I would see its reference in movies and in the internet but English not being my first language, I was afraid to read it. It turned out to be fairly easy, lighthearted and the content was too close to my heart, as if it were MY book. I couldn't believe I didn't read it earlier."
6107,kf8hbe,3,One Thousand White Women.  It say on my bookshelf for years before I read it.  It made me laugh and cry. So many great characters.
6108,kf8hbe,10,"I’m listening to the Richard Armitage narration of David Copperfield which has been in my Audible library for years now, but was daunted by the length (over 36 hours), and it did take me a bit to get into. It’s effing delightful and often hysterical, and despite the meandering style I’ve really started feeling invested. So glad I opted to finish out the year with this one.

Edited: a word"
6109,kf8hbe,3,"Also would add Dune for me, I read it recently.

Also if you like history, the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Super long but actually engaging and even witty from time to time. Really enjoyed it and learned a lot."
6110,kf8hbe,5,"Would also double click on this, I haven’t read any other by the Author other than this series and have really enjoyed it."
6111,kf8hbe,12,"Priory of the Orange Tree. I was completely daunted by its size, but absolutely loved the book. It read so much quicker than I thought it would."
6112,kf8hbe,6,"To Kill a Mockingbird. 
Knew about it for years, when I finally read it I was stunned. Thought it was awesome."
6113,kf8hbe,128,"The Book Thief. Absolute masterpiece, some of the most beautiful prose I've ever read."
6114,kf8hbe,119,11/22/63. Just finished it last month and it was my first King book ever and now possibly my favorite book I’ve ever read. Just started the Stand last night!
6115,kf8hbe,57,This is extremely encouraging cus this has been on my shelf for a while-- it will now be the next one I read!
6116,kf8hbe,42,Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry! Outstanding!
6117,kf8hbe,21,"The full list of the following - I was all 'those are girly books, I'm not into that ... I like science fiction and fantasy ... blah blah blah.' Turns out that teenaged me was shortsighted, and adult me is much more flexible and appreciates a wider range of literature. 

* Pride and Prejudice
* Emma
* Breakfast at Tiffany's
* Jane Eyre
* Sense and Sensibility
* Gone with the Wind
* Anne of Green Gables"
6118,kf8hbe,17,One of the few required readings I actually enjoyed
6119,kf8hbe,8,"The Color Purple. Gorgeous book with loveable, flawed, wonderful characters."
6120,kf8hbe,6,City of Thieves by David Benioff! Yes... season 8 sucked... but this book is great!
6121,kf8hbe,12,This is what I always recommend whenever someone is looking for a great novel. Thanks for recommending it!
6122,kf8hbe,20,"I’m 90% through (the audio book if that counts) and I gotta say... I just don’t get it. The prose is beautiful but the story is, so far, not very interesting.  If it were my grand father telling me the story I would listen, but I feel like I’m missing something."
6123,kf8hbe,9,Convenience store woman. Idk what it was but I really love and respect that book.
6124,kf8hbe,14,"Honestly, A Wrinkle In Time. It's a great feel-good book that I only picked up as an adult, despite having it on my shelf for about 15 years."
6125,kf8hbe,4,I’m about 25% of the way through right now. It really hasn’t reeled me in yet and I’m considering just moving on. Did you love it the entire time nonstop? Or did it pick up after the 1st 3rd?
6126,kf8hbe,3,You opened a door into a great catalog of books.Sanderson’s other cosmere books are definitely worth checking out to.
6127,kf8hbe,107,Nobody said The Kite Runner? That book sat on my shelf for two years. Once I started reading it I tore through it in two days.
6128,kf8hbe,12,"When i read 1984 at age 18 in grade 12. i read it on vacation in the hotel hot tub, while guys 10+ years older than me tried to hit me up. sorry bud was too busy gasping over the book and where it had been all my life"
6129,kf8hbe,12,That's the beauty of it as it feels like a relative is telling the story. You really feel the characters. I've never felt so connected to a character as I did to Samuel Hamilton. The plot itself is in the background.
6130,kf8hbe,8,The Great Gatsby. One of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. Never assigned to read it in high school so I didn't bread it until well after college. Wish I had read it sooner.
6131,kf8hbe,18,Lord of the rings
6132,kf8hbe,22,The giver
6133,kf8hbe,11,"When I read it I found the early-middle kinda slow, but really fell in love with the characters when Lee and Samuel came in"
6134,kf8hbe,5,"The Poppy War. I was convinced it was going to be some YA fantasy book that I’d DNF. When I finally picked it up I realized I had no idea what I was in for, finished it in two days, and couldn’t get my hands on the sequels fast enough."
6135,kf8hbe,19,"Adding that Persuasion by her is so good! Pride and Prejudice is amazing, but the character portrayals in Persuasion are truly stunning."
6136,kf8hbe,5,Came here to say the same!
6137,kf8hbe,6,"You’re missing out! Highly recommend the Mistborn series, it’s phenomenal"
6138,kf8hbe,4,Susanna Clarke has a new book? Omg I just love Jonathan Strange!
6139,kf8hbe,3,The alchemist my Paulo coelho I highly recommend it
6140,kf8hbe,10,"That was my first King book, too - I really enjoyed it.  (I loved the stand as well!)"
6141,kf8hbe,8,"Piranesi was gorgeous.

I fell deeply in love with Shakespeare during a reread as an adult- I was too intimidated to lose myself in the stories in high school and didn’t have the life experience to relate to the characters yet. I would recommend everyone skeptical to give Shakespeare another try post 35."
6142,kf8hbe,10,It’s been weeks and I still tear up thinking about the ending lmao. To be fair I’m &gt;!a total sap and sucker for tragic romance!&lt;. My dad is reading it now and I feel like I’m living it again through him!!
6143,kf8hbe,6,"Yes! Pride and Prejudice will always be special to me, but Persuasion is my favorite of hers."
6144,kf8hbe,16,"Exact opposite for me, unfortunately. I’d had it on my backlog for years and finally got around to it this year, and it was a slog. The experience was weird, too; after I’d stop reading for the day I’d be able to recognize that a lot had happened in what I had read, but the entire time I was actually reading it felt like there was absolutely nothing happening.

I can totally respect it for its world-building, though. Really interesting sci-fi fantasy world."
6145,kf8hbe,3,I have this on my library queue right now! It’ll be my first King novel.
6146,kf8hbe,11,Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. My dad always said it was his favorite book as a kid and I finally got around to reading it. Loved it so much I finished it in two days!
6147,kf8hbe,9,"Roots

I read it probably 20 years ago but I still think about it today. It was one of the last books on my mom’s bookshelf.  Kept skipping over it because it was huge.  Glad I finally read it."
6148,kf8hbe,8,"Speaking as someone who loves Dune and has read 7 of the books... the dialogue is wooden and the prose is pretty florid. It can definitely be a slog sometimes, I just found the slog worthwhile."
6149,kf8hbe,4,"Enjoy and read it slowly :) I read it in about 5 days and didn’t want it to end. I’ve never felt so deeply connected to another main character as I did with Jake, although we had almost nothing in common (I’m a 22 year old female college student)"
6150,kf8hbe,4,"It took me a while to get into it too, don’t worry. Steinbeck can be wordy at times lol, but I’m just a fast reader. I very much enjoyed the middle and end of the book, it definitely got to a point where it was hard to put it down!"
6151,kf8hbe,10,This one!!! It's a book I think back to often when I consider the meaning of life.
6152,kf8hbe,28,Same. I've been putting it off for so long. That and Don Quixote
6153,kf8hbe,14,Audiobooks totally count.
6154,kf8hbe,13,It’s one of the all-time most disappointing reads for me. That and Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I at least loved the beginning of that one. The first chapter was hilarious and then it was all downhill from there.
6155,kf8hbe,8,Read it this year for the first time at the age of 26. And I can't believe I waited so long. It was a masterpiece. Then and now.
6156,kf8hbe,3,"Yeah, I just re-read it and it was not nearly as good as I remembered. Just teenage-boy wish fulfillment."
6157,kf8hbe,13,I loved Circe but couldn’t even get into or finish Songs of Achilles. Her writing was so much better in Circe.
6158,kf8hbe,7,"That would be *Homo Deus* by Yuval Noah Harari. 

Although I had a physical copy for about a year, it stayed at the edge of the shelf, mysterious, black-covered and expectedly boring. The thickness also made it repulsive.

But then Covid lockdown hit and I was running out of paperbacks to read and obviously couldn't buy more. So one morning I happened to absentmindedly pick it up and start. Never had more intellectual revelations on a daily basis than while I was reading it. That book pushed me to read more nonfiction, explore concepts and my life would have been more interest if I had picked it up earlier. 

The fascination that originated from this book branched into picking up almost everything I read after."
6159,kf8hbe,9,I was coming here to comment Where the Crawford Sing. I thought it was going to be sappy or moralistic but honestly was super good. I heard there’s going to be a movie!
6160,kf8hbe,5,One of my go-to book suggestions for sure. The characters are just amazing.
6161,kf8hbe,8,"Came here to write this!  It was on my shelf for years, I never had the inclination to pick it up.  Loved it when I finally did"
6162,kf8hbe,6,The Kite Runner ... I knew one major plot point and just thought it sounded too morbid. So glad I picked it up anyway because it’s a beautiful read
6163,kf8hbe,8,Jurassic park by michael crichton. I never used to like sci-fi but this book got me there!!
6164,kf8hbe,5,Oh!  I forgot how much I adored this book!!
6165,kf8hbe,3,I'm so glad you said this. I don't know many people who also know this book but it was a required reading for me in a college class and I've been aching for something similar to it forever! I loveeedddd it.
6166,kf8hbe,3,I put this off for about 3 or 4 years and now it’s my favorite series with lord of the rings
6167,kf8hbe,10,Reading Magpie Murders right now!  Very good!
6168,kf8hbe,6,Not one particular book....but  Hemingway. I didn’t read my first Hemingway until age 42 and proceeded to read every word he ever published in a month. Goddamn that guy could write.
6169,kf8hbe,6,Does it count cuz piranesi came out this year like 2 months ago?
6170,kf8hbe,4,It’s long but a relatively “easy” read too.
6171,kf8hbe,10,"Ohh I need to reread Anne of Green Gables as an adult, thanks for recommending it. Love all the books on your list!"
6172,kf8hbe,24,My friend rereads it every summer
6173,kf8hbe,7,"Moby Dick, for some reason I thought I would never be able to read it and finish it. I discovered my preconceived notions were completely wrong. I’ve been on a roll lately, I guess thanks to Covid, finally reading several books I’ve put off."
6174,kf8hbe,4,"I had to read Emma in college and I hated every page of it. Who knows though, now that I am old maybe I'd have a different perspective. I did think Austin was a great writer, just the subject matter was not my cup of tea. I just couldn't relate to any of it."
6175,kf8hbe,22,"{{The Count of Monte Cristo}}

I don’t favor long books, and the 1,000 plus pages scared me off. But with the pandemic and more time I decided to give it a go.  I made a daily reading goal to keep pushing forward, most days it was no problem to meet and exceed my goal.  A great adventure and some good historical background made for a great read."
6176,kf8hbe,4,"[**The Count of Monte Cristo**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo)

6177,kf8hbe,8,"All the light we cannot see by Anthony Doerr, is one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read."
6178,kf8hbe,7,"I think you’d enjoy:

* Jamaica Inn
* Rebecca
* The Woman in White
* The Moonstone
* Wuthering Heights"
6179,kf8hbe,7,"I was just thinking the same! It only just came out, what do you mean you put it off for ages? I got my copy like a month ago and haven't read it yet, but I wouldn't say I'm putting it off?"
6180,kf8hbe,7,Dune
6181,kf8hbe,22,"Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events”

The series was wildly popular when I was a kid, all of my friends were reading it enthusiastically. But I stubbornly never did.

I now am an adult, and I’ve been reading the series to my 10 year old at night before bed for the last year. We are almost finished with it, and my god I am so invested in this series now. My daughter keeps telling me I don’t have to read her to sleep anymore, but I’m committed to finishing it with her!"
6182,kf8hbe,3,"I know why a caged bird sings. 

- thought it would be too hi brow. But I loved loved loved it!"
6183,kf8hbe,4,"Death note !
Fucking death note!God it is amazing !"
6184,kf8hbe,6,Books that made me cry.
6185,kf8hbe,4,Anna K. For sure.
6186,kf8hbe,15,"Circe by Madeline Miller. I was afraid it was going to let me down, because I felt like I couldn't possibly love it as much as The Song of Achilles, but I ended up loving it even more! It has become one of my favourites ever!"
6187,kf8hbe,4,same!! It was so good. I have The Stand sitting on my desk but haven’t gotten around to starting it. So glad I read 11/22/63 though!!
6188,kf8hbe,18,Lol I put off everything.
6189,kf8hbe,6,"I’m reading it now- when does it get good? I’m like 150 pages in.

(The stand is one of my top 10 favorite books of all time)"
6190,kf8hbe,29,Always here’s for the Khalid Hosseni
6191,kf8hbe,10,"To be honest, I was drawn in almost immediately so it just depends on your preference/taste. There is a lot of downtime spent in Jake’s head, and if that’s not for you that makes sense. 

Based on where you’re at it should start to pick up. Glad to hear you enjoyed the stand :)"
6192,kf8hbe,16,But have you put off putting off things?
6193,kf8hbe,3,"I think it’s probably his best. It’s actually the only ending I don’t remember hating. I like pet sementary, the longest walk and the shining as well."
6194,kf8hbe,7,"Hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy is one where it’s great if that’s your sense of humour. I personally love it. But there’s many popular comedies (Superbad, Stepbrothers) I just don’t find funny."
6195,kf8hbe,5,I have read everything she's written and I've loved it all *except* Emma. I just find the main character really irritating.  All the others I've read multiple times...but Emma just the once.
6196,kf8hbe,4,"Ooh I have pet semetary on my tbr! I read the shining in high school (by read, I mean skimmed lol) but I want to reread it because I definitely didn’t really appreciate it at the time lol"
6197,kf8hbe,6,I really want her to do a book on Medusa.
6198,kf8hbe,3,This is one of my all time favourite books since I was in elementary school. I reread it and a swiftly tilted planet Almost every year.
6199,kf8hbe,3,Now that’s bringing confusion. :p I can’t put off putting off things because then I won’t be putting it off anymore.
6200,kf8hbe,6,Well then you haven't put off everything. Which of course means that you have indeed put off everything. I hope thats crystal clear
6201,kf8hbe,3,War and Peace. Yes it’s LONG but it’s the most beautiful book I’ve ever read
6202,kf8hbe,10,still putting this one off because i know i’ll be sobbing at the end
6203,kf8hbe,15,American Gods by Neil Gaiman!
6204,kf8hbe,6,I could not get through Don Quixote.
6205,kf8hbe,3,"I avoided the Gunslinger by Stephen King the first book in the Dark Tower series in the 90’s because “if I wanna read a western I’ll read Lonesome Dove” which is awesome by the way lol. Fast forward and it’s hands down my favorite series and that damnable Gunslinger Roland Deschain is one of my favorite characters. Highly recommend the Dark Tower series. That series roont me, do ya kin roont? 😉"
6206,kf8hbe,6,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. I read this over quarantine and I think if I would have read this earlier in my life I would be a different person today.
6207,kf8hbe,7,"North and south by Elizabeth gaskell. I kept on saying I will read it later then this summer I listened to some chapters as an audiobook while drawing and omg I fell in love, finished it in few days then watched the mini-series, it was worth it, that is if you like romance and leads with strong personalities"
6208,kf8hbe,15,"Oooh yes! I've always steered clear of Stephen King because I thought he wrote only horror novels and I don't like them. SO glad I finally read 11/22/63 and then The Stand, they're both excellent!

Edit: typo"
6209,kf8hbe,5,"Ok please help me: I'm over 200 pages into Dune (Paul and Jessica are still in the desert) and I can't get into it. Like, it's okay but not nearly the hype everyone gives it. I find it kind of cheesy. I'm surprised because I'm a big sci fi fan and everyone says it's a landmark of the genre. Am I crazy or does it pick up?"
6210,kf8hbe,5,Yes!! I never thought I would be interested in his writing tbh
6211,kf8hbe,4,"Still one of my favourite series of all time! If you can, check out the TV series they did (not the movie lol), they basically do 2 episodes per book and they're so well done! (I think it's on Netflix??)"
6212,kf8hbe,7,"I have this book sitting in my shelf for a while. I tried to read it recently (was in a little gloomy mood), I couldn't read more than first 2-3 pages. After reading your review,  I think I would give it a try again after reading the book I am currently reading."
6213,kf8hbe,19,"Same! It’s always been my mom’s all-time favorite and I kind of wrote it off as a shallow romance (don’t ask me why I thought that, my mom is a snobbish English Major, just like me). The copy she gave me sat on my shelf for probably ten years before I read it. I can hardly begin to describe how complex and moving this book was. It’s definitely in my top 3 if not my favorite book I’ve read. Moms are right!"
6214,kf8hbe,6,Outlander - it’d been recommended to me numerous times before I finally found a deal for a $.99 ebook and decided to give in. Binged the whole series and was bereft when i got through book 8 only to find out book 9 hadn’t been published.
6215,kf8hbe,10,"Same! I thought it was a romance novel so avoided it for years but then when I finally started reading it, I got sucked in and carried it everywhere with me so I could sneak in a few pages during any spare moments of the day."
6216,kf8hbe,3,"how to win friends &amp; influence people - dale carnegie  


someone please recommend me book like this pls"
6217,kf8hbe,5,"This book had some of the best characterization I have ever read. 
Usually when a book is high concept like this, I am impatient to get to the end to find out the resolution of the main premise but with this one, I was so invested in the characters that I didn't want it to end."
6218,kf8hbe,6,"My big one is *Pride and Prejudice*. I had a few pages to power through, but by the end I was hooked and I now understand the hype."
6219,kf8hbe,11,I took a break from *Don Quixote* in 2014. I'm going back eventually.
6220,kf8hbe,11,"I'm a BIG fan of Stephen King, and I also struggled to get ""hooked"" by this book. I found that I didn't really get into it until Jake arrived in Derry. I don't want to say anymore because spoilers, but I definitely put this one in my top 5 Stephen King books once I finished it. I hope you find the hook!"
6221,kf8hbe,6,I think you're right about at the part where it's going to start picking up ! Do be aware though that the pace is relatively introductory to the series as a whole. But it does get good. I started reading it about a week ago and am almost done. Definitely going to read the next books!
6222,kf8hbe,3,This is my favorite book of all time. The only book I've ever been compelled to read twice.
6223,kf8hbe,3,"Same! I love everything else by Jane Austen, but Emma is so insufferable. I like movies based on Emma, but I can't handle the whole novel of her prattling on."
6224,kf8hbe,5,I have Circe on my list. Is it a good read if you only have a basic knowledge of Greek mythology?
6225,kf8hbe,3,"I will absolutely be rereading this one multiple times in my life. Still recovering from the first read, though ;)"
6226,kf8hbe,5,"I’ve seen them up to the Grim Grotto episodes! My daughter and I watch the episodes when we finish the book. It’s a fun treat, and she gets so excited!"
6227,kf8hbe,33,A Thousand Splendid Suns was also just also just as good! I could read those books over and over again but don't because of how sad they can get
6228,kf8hbe,4,A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. I was so intimidated by the sheer size and content warnings for this book that I put it off for nearly 2 years before reading it. I bawled my eyes out to the point that my chest hurt when I finished this book lol. It was totally worth it and now is my favourite book of all time.
6229,kf8hbe,5,"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Oh my word, it's a coming of age story, love stories, overcoming prejudice story,  coming to terms with yourself story, finding success through cleverness and hard work story, and so much more. Its beautifully written and contains beautiful stories. It shows the birth of comics and the 30s through the 50s so beautifully.  God I love this book."
6230,kf8hbe,5,That’s a valid reason to put it off. At least you’re not hesitating to read it because you think it’s going to be boring!
6231,kf8hbe,3,"Are you allowed to recommend non fiction? If so, I’d say A Brief History of Time."
6232,kf8hbe,13,I prefer A Thousand Splendid Suns over The Kite Runner too. Far richer ending to it than its predecessor.
6233,kf8hbe,5,"Don Quixote is actually pretty funny! Never would have expected that from such an old classic. I listened to an audiobook, together with my husband, and we found it very amusing."
6234,kf8hbe,3,So good. Read it my senior year of high school over Christmas and cried about it.
6235,kf8hbe,6,"I read Circe this year, and it was my first ever book about greek mythology, and I absolutely LOVED IT!! It's written in a way that isn't confusing at all, I didn't know anything about Greek gods and I didn't have any problem in following the storyline. I would say just read it."
6236,kf8hbe,11,"For a “horror” writer, people (myself included) underestimate his storytelling. There’s a REASON his horror lands when it does, and that’s because he has a brilliant grasp on atmosphere characterization and detailed storytelling. His plots often aren’t super complex, but he spins his yarns with all the skill of a seasoned storyteller, horror or otherwise. :)"
6237,kf8hbe,3,"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold by John le Carré. I knew it was lauded but thought it would be dated, dull, cheesy, and spoiled by 1000 imitations. Holy smokes. way wrong, although fair warning the main woman character is very much the love interest of a doomed character (no spoilers). It is intricately plotted and deeply tense. The characters are nuanced and tortured (internally and, in a few scenes, externally) and this is absolutely not a novel of good v evil. It’s the gold standard of spy novels."
6238,kf8hbe,4,"Small Gods by Terry Pratchett. It’d been sitting on my shelf forever for when I needed a funny read to lighten my mood. Delivered on the humor, but was WAY more moving and emotional than I had expected. For a comedy, I was crying at the end (happy tears, but they were bittersweet). The only other experience I had like it was when I read Catch-22, another great book I regret putting off."
6239,kf8hbe,6,"I was honestly shocked at how much I enjoyed reading this when I first read it. I’ve always heard it was great, but I only found The Hobbit to be OK at best, and a bit of a slog, so I kept putting off starting LotR. Big regret as it’s easily one of the best fantasy series I’ve read. Still slow in places, but the writing and prose is always perfect and powerful despite being a style I rarely read."
6240,kf8hbe,5,American Gods by Neil Gaiman. My boss recommended it to me and it wasn’t til about a year later that I read it on a trip to visit my grandmother. I finished that behemoth of a book in 2 weeks.
6241,kf8hbe,3,"Definitely Little Women for me. When I was a kid, we had it on our bookshelves but for some reason it never appealed to me. The book cover was dull compared to many other books so I never reached for it. Recently read it and wish I had read it when I was younger!"
6242,kf8hbe,3,"Same here! It's fascinating, though, and weirdly immersive for such a rambling, digressive yarn. Plus I now know so, so much about 19th Century whaling."
6243,kf8hbe,3,"And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. I’ve always loved mysteries and who-dunnits but even decades later and after so many retellings later, she is the queen. The story is short and to the point, she does not dawdle or drag on. It is perfection. I wish I had read it sooner so I would have gotten through more of her books by now."
6244,kf8hbe,18,"I saw a book called ""The woman who never read Chomsky"" - about a woman who buys, and never reads, a Chomsky book. I identified a lot, but haven't read it ;)"
6245,kf8hbe,4,"A guy I worked with recommended The Journeyer by Gary Jennings to me. Said his mother gave him a copy when he left for college. He loaned me the hard cover copy his mother gave him. I read ten pages and lost interest. 

The owner of our restaurant was running things. And by that I mean into the ground. We have to part ways, I give my coworker his book back. Time passes. 

Dude seemed to be really into this book. See used copy of book at a store. Pick it up on a whim. 

Start reading again. Not really into it until about page 50. Then everything shifts. Fantastic book. 

Try to tell friends about it. “It’s the fictional autobiography of Marco Polo going from Venice to the court of Kublai Khan.”

Probably my favorite book of all time. Thousand plus pages. Read it 5-6 times. 

I have never convinced another human to even attempt reading this book. As soon as they see how thicc it is their eyes glaze like Krispy Kreme. 

I loaned it to someone that never gave it back. I just made myself sad. Now I can’t pull it off the shelf and read it again."
6246,kf8hbe,3,Do not stop. At minimum read the second and third in the series. They are fantastic.
6247,kf8hbe,3,"honestly, the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan. read PJO when I was younger but only recently got around to the follow-up series - even though they’re targeted at a younger age group they still resonate as an adult, and Riordan has done a really nice job working to include more diverse characters"
6248,kf8hbe,3,House of Leaves
6249,kf8hbe,6,"The Little Prince/Le Petit Prince.   - Antoine de Saint Exupery

I was given a copy when o was 8.  It sat in my bookcase for over thirty years collecting dust. I decided to read it to my Mother during her final days.  Completely changed me.  Now I read it once a year.  Each time it means something new to me."
6250,kf8hbe,5,"The Historian by Elizabeth Kostovo

I actually worked at a bookstore when it first came out. All my coworkers loved it and just never got around to it. Finally read it a full decade later and texted my friend asking why she didn’t force me to back then. 

Now I constantly buy used copies and then hand them out to people who ask for book recommendations."
6251,kf8hbe,9,"I’m from England so we didn’t read this book at school and So I read it as an adult and omg was it good! I didn’t even think I’d like it, I just wanted to something to get me to work and back. It was a nice surprise."
6252,kf8hbe,7,"To be fair, Emma‘s supposed to be irritating, according to even Austen herself. She admits to her flaws though and grows by the end, which is something I really enjoyed about the book.
But to each their own. :)"
6253,kf8hbe,4,I had the same. The book is as dry as the world it describes. I'm a Sci fi and fantasy fan but Dune... meh. It does pick up some speed near the end but not really worth it.  3/5
6254,kf8hbe,5,Eleanor Oliphant is complete fine. What an absolute masterpiece.
6255,kf8hbe,8,I was turned off by the first few pages but pushed through and then loved it.
6256,kf8hbe,7,"If you haven't read *A Thousand Splendid Suns*, I found I liked this one a great deal more than *The Kite Runner*."
6257,kf8hbe,3,*The Sparrow* and *A Prayer for Owen Meany*. Both of them blew me away.
6258,kf8hbe,3,you will NOT be let down. go for it
6259,kf8hbe,3,'Anne of Green Gables'. A female friend of mine recommended it to me and I thought it might be a bit too girly for me. Turns out I was wrong. Anne just leaps off the page and into your heart.
6260,kf8hbe,3,All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. Thought it would be a bit boring but it was quite good in the end. Very well written!
6261,kf8hbe,4,"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. 

I thought I wouldn't enjoy science fiction. Finished the entire series now."
6262,kf8hbe,5,"It picked up for me around then. The beginning really weighs you down with exposition and all the made up terms, but I was flying through the last 200ish pages once I got momentum. As far as the cheesiness, I think Herbert can get a little lost in philosophizing, but even wit that his plots/worldbuiling are great!"
6263,kf8hbe,3,"I have a few that 2020 helped clear, Love in the Time of Cholera and Midnight's Children"
6264,kf8hbe,5,"The Hunger Games. I wrote it off years ago saying I would never read it because I didn't believe it would live up to the hype and I heard a lot of negative things about it. Finally picked it up last year.

There's a reason it spawned a massive trend in the YA community: it's good. The trilogy is far from perfect, and I have a lot of issues with the third book, but it was so much better than I expected.

Honourable mention: Pet Sematary. My favourite King book and my favourite book of all time. Just perfect."
6265,kf8hbe,3,"If you wind up enjoying The Stand, check out the Dark Tower series afterwards"
6266,kf8hbe,3,"The boy in the stripped pajamas. A friend gave me this a while back and I was just putting it off thinking, well it's simple and childish. Even my sister took it from me, and was taken aback when she heard I haven't read it yet. Then, in one lucky morning I started it and boy it was the most eerie book I have ever read! Behind every sweet and innocent conversation or scenarios, I could feel the presence of a cruel devil whispering and plotting how he is going to ruin it all."
6267,kf8hbe,3,"Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card. I didn’t value speculative fiction and fantasy. Something finally convinced me to read Ender’s, and it changed my mind. In fact it’s one of only a handful of books I’ve chosen to read twice."
6268,kf8hbe,5,"I LOVE Scarlett. She is selfish, entitled, manipulative, spoiled... it was really refreshing to read about her (instead than ""I'm cute and modest and everyone likes me but I don't realise it""). But when I finished the book I thought ""Oh no, and now? What do I do without Scarlett?"".

I also loved Melanie (the only real lady, as Rhett put it), another very strong female character, even though in a very different way from Scarlett (the sword scene!)."
6269,kf8hbe,3,no! it has nothing to do w jonathan strange book; they each stand alone. although the author clearly likes the concept of other worlds.
6270,kf8hbe,3,Dude that ending destroyed me
6271,kf8hbe,3,The Martian by Andy Weir. I had a coworker who kept telling me time and again that I really needed to read. I kept putting it off forever. I finally read it and it's now in my top ten fave list and I read it at least once or twice a year.
6272,kf8hbe,3,"Circe is definitely in my top 5 favorites reads this year. I haven't read Song of Achilles yet, but I'm really looking forward to it."
6273,kf8hbe,3,"When were you at School? We did it for our GCSE English in the early ‘90s. I know that most of my cohort that didn’t go to my School also did it.

That said, it was absolutely the only required reading book that I loved whilst having to complete comprehension essays."
6274,kf8hbe,3,I've got Where the Crawdads Sing sat waiting on my kindle but just havent got round to committing to it yet. I may give it a go now!
6275,kf8hbe,4,I just finished this myself! I held off for the exact same reasons you did - I loved The Song of Achilles so much that I was nervous to read Circe. But Circe was such a brilliant story! Had to lay down on the floor when I was done because it was just so satisfying :) I just wanted to keep thinking about her and about her story
6276,kf8hbe,3,"It’s a fantastic book! I remember reading it while I was in high school, after I saw the movie. And I always wished that Margaret Mitchell had written more. After learning more about her life, she had quite a fascinating real-life story as well."
6277,kf8hbe,3,"Piranesi is a quick read. I actually just finished Jonathan Strange after reading and loving Piranesi. The former is definitely a long one, but the world she describes is so immersive and meticulous. It's a seriously impressive book, and a proper epic."
6278,kf8o02,3,"The Glass Book of the Dream Eaters is a steampunky fantasy with three POV characters, one of whom very much fits the Sherlock/Indy mold. Its a thick book but hella fun"
6279,kf8o02,4,The Warrior's Apprentice by Lois Macmaster Bujold.
6280,kf8o02,3,"A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles - great character, interesting story and setting"
6281,kf9tau,4,"How wonderful of you. I don't have any personalised suggestions, but I would Google it.ive just found lots! Maybe then read it and check you are happy with it. Sorry that isn't more helpful, but I wanted to say how great you sound!"
6282,kf9tau,3,"Graphic novels are where you should look. My Favorite Thing Is Monsters is 100 percent what you want. But the only problem is that it has adult stuff in it. 

Fun Home by Alison Bechdel is also really good. I don't remember if there is adult stuff in there"
6283,kf9tau,7,"Most people know who they are attracted to by that age. I had my first kiss at 13, noticed boys a few years before that."
6284,kf9tau,23,"{{these witches don’t burn}} might be perfect for her age. it’s super cute, nothing too adult in the themes, but it’s still mature"
6285,kf9tau,13,"[**These Witches Don't Burn (These Witches Don't Burn, #1)**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36484081-these-witches-don-t-burn)

^(By: Isabel Sterling | 336 pages | Published: 2019 | Popular Shelves: fantasy, young-adult, lgbtq, lgbt, ya | )[^(Search ""these witches don’t burn"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=these witches don’t burn&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Hannah's a witch, but not the kind you're thinking of. She's the real deal, an Elemental with the power to control fire, earth, water, and air. But even though she lives in Salem, Massachusetts, her magic is a secret she has to keep to herself. If she's ever caught using it in front of a Reg (read: non-witch), she could lose it. For good. So, Hannah spends most of her time avoiding her ex-girlfriend (and fellow Elemental Witch) Veronica, hanging out with her best friend, and working at the Fly by Night Cauldron selling candles and crystals to tourists, goths, and local Wiccans. 
&gt;
&gt;But dealing with her ex is the least of Hannah's concerns when a terrifying blood ritual interrupts the end-of-school-year bonfire. Evidence of dark magic begins to appear all over Salem, and Hannah's sure it's the work of a deadly Blood Witch. The issue is, her coven is less than convinced, forcing Hannah to team up with the last person she wants to see: Veronica.
&gt;
&gt;While the pair attempt to smoke out the Blood Witch at a house party, Hannah meets Morgan, a cute new ballerina in town. But trying to date amid a supernatural crisis is easier said than done, and Hannah will have to test the limits of her power if she's going to save her coven and get the girl, especially when the attacks on Salem's witches become deadlier by the day.

6296,kf9tau,11,"This is so lovely of you! I would read a description of these books before you buy them, since I think some of them involve a decent amount of homophobia. I’m not saying you need to totally avoid that, but for example — I really enjoyed Upright Women Wanted, it’s a fun and affirming book, but it also takes place in a deeply homophobic and religious dystopian America. I think that if you give her something like that, it might be nice to also pair it with another book that doesn’t have that kind of premise. I’m also a lesbian, and I think that when I came out I wanted to think about and process the reality of homophobia and how it would affect my life, but I also didn’t want to feel that it was inevitable and ever present and was going to hover over my future always and forever. And I was older when I came out, if I had at thirteen I don’t know that I would have wanted to be gifted books with characters processing rejection and hatred. Anyway sorry to ramble, I actually have to run but I will definitely come back and add some recommendations for you!"
6297,kf9tau,11,"Maybe take a look at the Wayward Children books by Seanan McGuire. YA, diverse characters, both gay and straight, cis and trans. I think any book of the series could be read independently. The second volume, Down Among the Sticks and Bones, is a story with a lesbian main character; I haven't yet read the fifth volume, Come Tumbling Down, but the summary suggests it also features that character."
6298,kf9tau,4,Fun Home has sex scenes and talks about her father’s death.  I wouldn’t give that to a 13 yo.
6299,kf9tau,3,Agree
6300,kf9tau,3,"Upright Women Wanted is amazing and When We Were Magic (same author) is about a queer teen girl, specifically. However, almost everything I've read by the author has involved some degree of gore - if she's sensitive to that, UWW is the better choice because there wasn't any body horror that I recall"
6301,kf9tau,5,"{{Ivy Aberdeen’s Letter to the World}} 

{{Silhouette of a Sparrow}} 

{{The Miseducation of Cameron Post}} could be good, but i would recommend reading about it first because it deals with really heavy topics (conversion therapy, and it’s effects) and it really depends on how mature/ready she is for it. I read it when I was her age so I’m still recommending it.

The same with {{Moon at Nine}} - it deals with homophobia and the death penalty in the Middle East. Check goodreads reviews which go into the ending. 

Also, I second *Annie on My Mind*. It’s definitely a baby lesbian classic (I read it as her age!) I’m sure it’s incredibly helpful to have someone supportive like you :)"
6302,kf9tau,3,I just came here to suggest that! I was lucky enough to take a class taught by the author and she’s truly one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met!!
6303,kf9tau,3,"Hello! I'm back with a few ideas that haven't come up yet.

The City We Became by N.K. Jemison –– I think this would be great for a mature 13 year old, its fun and exciting and original urban fantasy, and 3/6 main characters are part of the LGBTQ community. Lots of LGBTQ books, especially YA ones, are about processing and dealing with being different from the norm. But sometimes its also just fun and super refreshing to read something where people like you are just part of the fabric of the world, and the story is about fighting Lovecraftian monsters, not coming out – but it also recognizably takes place in normal New York, and so you and people like you are clearly just everywhere in normal New York! The characters are all adults though, its not YA and doesn't star people her age.

We Are Okay by Nina LaCour –– I was blown away by this. But it's all about a college freshman who is feeling immobilized by grief after her grandfather's death – so as amazing as it was, you might want something less heavy. That said, the writing is genuinely beautiful, and it might be a serious book about grief but its also for meant for young adults so it shouldn't overwhelm her. And the relationship is so sweet, the main character's crush/maybe girlfriend comes to visit her at college and take care of her. If you want something less heavy though, it looks like the same author wrote another, lighter looking YA book with a lesbian couple called Everything Leads to You.

Weetzie Bat by Francesca Lia Block –– I have actually not read this yet! But it was recommended to me as bizarre, queer, dreamlike coming of age story. Its set in a magical alternative version of LA. Maybe check it out!"

Edit* theres another comment that explains it better"
6309,kfkui0,51,"Unfortunately don't have any novels to suggest, but it comes up often when people here ask for erotica - literotica.com hosts plenty of genuinely high quality writing. Look for stories in the various genre Halls of Fame, tagged with the big red H (""hot"") or blue W (""contest winner""), or that are highly rated. You can surely find stories that are as lurid as you could possibly want on this site, you just have to be slightly discerning, since there are definitely plenty of poorly-written or tasteless ones.

6373,kfn5cd,3,"[**Cloud Atlas**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas)

^(By: David Mitchell | 509 pages | Published: 2004 | Popular Shelves: fiction, science-fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, historical-fiction | )[^(Search ""cloud atlas by David Mitchell"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=cloud atlas by David Mitchell&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.
&gt;
&gt;Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .
&gt;Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.
&gt;But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.
&gt;
&gt;As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.

6374,kfn5cd,30,"I personally loved Maurice by EM Forster! It isn’t quite historical fiction, but it was a really thrilling, tragic romance!"
6375,kfn5cd,7,"Edward II - Marlowe!!!

It’s a play from the 16th century but it’s pretty damn good, and the Jarman film adaptation is awesome too."
6376,kfn5cd,44,"Tipping the Velvet was pretty awesome. It's set in the late 19th century tho, not sure if that's historical enough. It's about a woman that falls in love with a male impersonator (by trade!). It's not men (at least not in the traditional sense), but still an interesting look at queer life in them there olden days."
6377,kfn5cd,9,The Vesuvius Club by Mark Gatiss!
6378,kfn5cd,13,"Oh, I loved Maurice! I think I especially like it bc it's actually written in the period it's describing, which makes me not have to suspend any disbelief!"
6379,kfn5cd,3,"It's not, I'm specifically looking for gay men, but thank you nonetheless!"
6380,kfn5cd,7,"I'm specifically looking for gay men, but thank you nonetheless!"
6381,kfn5cd,3,"It’s sooooo good! I also suggest Fight Club, which is very much a gay novel! Even if you’ve seen the movie, the book is a totally different experience, and it makes it much more apparent that it’s About being closeted (it’s also About AIDS but that’s a much more subtle theme)"
6382,kfn5cd,3,"I mean, that's 100% fair. I've read the Odyssey and the Illiad, what else would you suggest?"
6383,kfn5cd,7,"I don't think it's exactly what I'm looking for rn (I'd like there to be a relationship, not just people being in the closet, since I really...... wasn't?) but I'll be sure to put it on my list!"
6384,kfn5cd,30,"I’ve just finished it.  Close your mind, don’t ask if it’s believable, and just enjoy the romp."
6385,kfn5cd,8,"I'll try my best! I found it on YouTube, so I might just listen to it while I make maps!"
6386,kfn5cd,4,Jordy Rosenberg's *Confessions of the Fox* is a queer metafictional picaresque set in Renaissance England.
6387,kfn5cd,11,I have no idea what that means?
6388,kfn5cd,11,"It’s more of a memoir of a gay man and letter to his mother (and as such is very recent history) but I highly recommend {On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous}. I would also recommend {The Great Believers} which is set during the AIDS epidemic. Since those two are both depressing, while it is kinda YA and more modern day fantasy, {Carry On} has the rarer happier love story between two gay teenagers"
6389,kfn5cd,59,"*As Meat Loves Salt* by Maria McCann-takes place in the seventeenth century during the English Civil War

*The Persian Boy* by Mary Renault- part of a series based on the life of Alexander the Great.  She has written books about gay male relationships in other time periods as well, such as *The Charioteer* which takes place in England during WWII."
6390,kfn5cd,11,"
It's metafictional: it plays games and asks questions about it's nature as a fictional object. The narrative is presented as a historical document, with contemporary commentary. The commentary is in a state of constant interrogation with the main narrative as to is historicity. 

It's a picaresque: an episodic adventure narrative concerning a roguish main character."
6391,kfn5cd,12,"It’s not a book, but Black Sails is a series that has gay pirates and it’s very very good."
6392,kfn5cd,11,"Homegoing- Yaa Gyasi

However, it’s one of the protagonists in the story. The story has a revolving door of them."
6393,kfn5cd,4,"If you read the post, that's actually what I read last. It's awesome! I read the Illiad when I was about 12, and was super mad at the Troy movie for being not gay at all."
6394,kfn5cd,5,Such a beautiful book - just wonderful
6395,kfn5cd,7,"Maurice by EM Forster, a romance about gay men that was written in 1913 though only published decades later. Revolutionary in its time, not least for its positive and not-depressing portrayal of gay life."

6405,kfn5cd,5,I think Flint is the best gay person I’ve ever watched in a not-gay show/movie.
6406,kfn5cd,8,"Yes! And also, like, very hot. Which shouldn't matter, but I like eyecandy"
6407,kfn5cd,6,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
6408,kfn5cd,11,That’s a fine reason. I’m a lesbian but I still can see his ...merits
6409,kfn5cd,7,"Yes, excellent way of describing it. But seriously, very well written series over all!"
6410,kfn5cd,3,The Book of Salt by Monique Truong! I read it in my Asian American Studies Literature class and it was so interesting
6411,kfn5cd,30,"The Lord John novels by Diana Gabaldon 

Full disclosure I have not read them myself. I read the Outlander books and lord John is a side character in them. He is a gay male, although he did also marry a woman and consummate that marriage out of the necessity of the times, from what I understand. Timeline is the mid to late 1700s. 

Edited for spelling."
6412,kfn5cd,4,"“Southernmost” by Silas House and “At Swim, Two Boys” by Jamie O’Neill. 
The first is a story about a guy couple and their friendship with the local parish priest - lots of amazing discussions about prejudice, hatred and fear. 
And the second is a coming-of-age book about two boys in Ireland - amazing descriptions by the author."
6413,kfn5cd,5,Also Holding the Man. The book and the movie are beautiful and heartbreaking.
6414,kfn5cd,3,"It's a little hard to find historical fiction with gay characters that obviously isn't mainly a romance novel, but if you're able to go a little bit into the speculative fiction/fantasy side of things I really enjoyed the Amberlough Trilogy by Lara Elena Donnelly which is set in a sort of pseudo Weimar Republic. Also if you want to obliterate yourself emotionally Strange Meeting by Susan Hill takes place during WWI is very gay coded (if not blatant. I can't remember. I just remember crying a lot.)"
6415,kfn5cd,8,"{{The Bird King}} is historical fiction with fantasy elements. It's set in Spain right on the eve of the Moorish kings being ousted by the Spanish. The main characters are the deposed king's mistress and a gay cartographer. The latter runs afoul of the Spanish inquisition, so the two of them go into hiding together. Along the way they encounter a lot of fantasy creatures and places from Islamic tradition. I don't know if I've ever read anything like this (I mean that in a positive way.) 

{{And I Darken}} is alternate history YA. It asks that question we've all asked ourselves ""what if Vlad the Impaler had been born a woman?"" In all seriousness though, the POV chapters switch between her and her younger brother who is a gay man, This series is so good. 

{{The Death of Vivek Oji}} is probably on the cusp of historical fiction because it's a family saga going over a couple generations, with some of the latter generations being set in present times. Has really interesting insight in Nigeria and one of the POVs is a queer man. This book is intense and tragic but also strangely heartwarming at times, mostly due to the friendships between the titular character and their friends. Not one to read if you're not in the mood for LGBT suffering, but it's not all misery porn imo.

{{An Oresteia by Anne Carson}} might be worth a look since you mentioned Song of Achilles. It's poet Anne Carson's translation of three plays by three different ancient Greek playwrights and it collectively tells the story of the downfall of the House of Atreus (Agamemnon's family.) She has a very interesting and engaging translation style, and in the last play she leans pretty  heavily into Orestes and Pylades having homoerotic tension, imo. It's where that ""[taking care of me] is rotten work."" ""Not to me. Not if it's you."" quote comes from.

Haha compiling recs made me realize I read a lot of f/f but almost nothing m/m!"
6416,kfn5cd,8,"“As Meat Loves Salt” is an excellent read, its pretty immersive into the time period, quite graphic. I absolutely recommend it."
6417,kfn5cd,3,Came here to suggest The Persian Boy as well!
6418,kfn5cd,3,"I haven’t read it yet, but it’s on my list and I can’t wait to get to it. It’s called The Scottish Boy by Alex de Campi"
6419,kfn5cd,16,Yes! The Persian boy and that entire series is amazing. The author literally takes you to that time period with her writing.
6420,kfn5cd,5,"I find it amazing how many people don’t read in a sub about reading, to be honest."
6421,kfn5cd,7,"KJ Charles has a historical fantasy series set in Victorian England called A Charm of Magpies. It’s a fun series with a wonderful gay couple at the center. It’s not fine literature, but the books are fun, well written, and the gay characters don’t feel like stereotypes. There’s a lot of sex scenes, fyi. I personally enjoyed the sexy stuff, and it is actually central to the narrative, but some people are put off by graphic sex scenes, so I wanted to mention. I enjoyed the books immensely and wish there were more than 3 with Stephen and Lucien as the main characters."
6422,kfn5cd,4,"Surprised to see no one has mentioned {{Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart}}. It won the 2020 Man Booker prize, and it features absolutely hard-hitting but gorgeous prose.

EDIT: It may not necessarily be set as deep in the past as some of the other recommendations in this thread, but I’d still really recommend it!"
6423,kfn5cd,8,"*Days Without End* by Sebastian Barry

*All God's Children* by Aaron Gwyn

*Wingmen* by Ensan Case"
6424,kfn5cd,10,"Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin is pretty amazing...history of the “closet” 
Beautifully told...rips your heart out..."
6425,kfn5cd,3,I really like {{The Persian Boy by Mary Renault}} about Alexander the Great through the eyes of his eunuch lover
6426,kfn5cd,3,"[**The Persian Boy (Alexander the Great, #2)**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67700.The_Persian_Boy)

&gt;“It takes skill to depict, as Miss Renault has done, this half-man, half Courtesan who is so deeply in love with the warrior.”–The Atlantic Monthly
&gt;
&gt;The Persian Boy traces the last years of Alexander’s life through the eyes of his lover, Bagoas. Abducted and gelded as a boy, Bagoas was sold as a courtesan to King Darius of Persia, but found freedom with Alexander after the Macedon army conquered his homeland. Their relationship sustains Alexander as he weathers assassination plots, the demands of two foreign wives, a sometimes-mutinous army, and his own ferocious temper. After Alexander’s mysterious death, we are left wondering if this Persian boy understood the great warrior and his ambitions better than anyone.

6427,kfn5cd,3,"The Lord John Grey novels by Diana Gabaldon. They can be read independently of the Outlander series, but there’s some gaps in the big series that add to the story.

I really liked “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” by Taylor Jenkins Reid as well. The main characters are lesbians, but it was fantastic."

My favorites are the England series (Think of England, which is m/m, and its prequel, Proper English, which is f/f) and the Society of Gentleman series, which are Regency romances set around the time of the Peterloo Massacre in England.

^(By: Megan Devine | ? pages | Published: 2017 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, grief, self-help, nonfiction, psychology | )[^(Search ""It’s OK That You’re Not OK"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=It’s OK That You’re Not OK&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;A New Resource for Those Experiencing Loss
&gt;
&gt; With It’s OK That You’re Not OK, Megan Devine offers a profound new approach to both the experience of grief and the way we help others who have endured tragedy. Having experienced grief from both sides—as both a therapist and as a woman who witnessed the accidental drowning of her beloved partner—Megan writes with deep insight about the unspoken truths of loss, love, and healing. She debunks the culturally prescribed goal of returning to a normal, ""happy"" life, replacing it with a far healthier middle path, one that invites us to build a life alongside grief rather than seeking to overcome it.
&gt;
&gt; On this unabridged audio recording read by the author, Megan offers stories, research, life tips, and creative and mindfulness-based practices to guide us through an experience we all must face. With Megan’s gentle but direct guidance, you’ll learn:
&gt;
&gt; • Why well-meaning advice, therapy, and spiritual wisdom so often end up making it harder for people in grief
&gt; • How challenging the myths of grief—doing away with stages, timetables, and unrealistic ideals about how grief should unfold—allows us to accept it as a mystery to be honored instead of a problem to solve
&gt; • Practical guidance for managing stress, improving sleep, and decreasing anxiety without trying to ""fix"" your pain
&gt;
&gt; Many people who have suffered a loss feel judged, dismissed, and misunderstood by a culture that wants to ""solve"" grief. Megan writes, ""Grief no more needs a solution than love needs a solution."" It’s OK That You’re Not OK is a book for grieving people, those who love them, and all those seeking to love themselves—and each other—better.

6460,kfoctm,17,"I'm sorry for your loss.

If you are looking for a bit of levity to help with the grief I would suggest some of Terry Pratchett's discworld books from the Death series.

It follows the anthropomorphic personification of Death, the skeleton with the robe and the scythe. Most of the books while being really funny still talk about the acceptance and nature of death and process of grief in a very thoughtful way.

I'd suggest either Mort, the first book in the death series (they can all be read separately). Death takes on a human apprentice, Mort, who has to learn the ropes of life and deth and the in between.

Or Reaper Man, where death takes a holiday to find himself and befriends a lovely old lady.

I hope you find something that helps you through what must be a really trying time."
6461,kfoctm,4,I came here to suggest Mort/ Reaper Man as well.
6462,kfoctm,6,"If you just need a happy book to escape try either The Phantom Tollbooth or Aru Shah and the end of time.  They are just silly adventures with nice solvable problems.

If you want books about grieving and death,  Caitlin Doughty has a book called From here to eternity that explores different ways people grieve from around the world.  She also has a youtube channel that talks about the funeral industry and she has excellent advice about affordable funerals. The channel is called Ask a mortician.  

This isn't a book but it gives me great comfort. If you like listening to stuff, Terrible Thanks for asking is a good podcast. It's basically stories about other people going through hard times and how they are coping or moving through life after a not great thing happened (its not always death, often its a crappy life event or some relatable obstacle). 

I'm sorry you lost your father OP. I wish you health and healing."
6463,kfoctm,3,"Im so sorry for your loss, and seconding this recommendation. I think whats great about it is it addresses how to live w grief without platitudes that feel disingenuous"
6464,kfoctm,5,When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi really helped me with my journey through the grief of losing somebody very dear to me. (And I’m sorry for you loss.)

6466,kfoctm,6,Came here to say this.
6467,kfoctm,5,This is one of the most beautifully written books about dying and death.  It helped me answer some questions when my father died.  Great recommendation.
6468,kfoctm,4,"OMG thank you. ❤️ I’m so relieved to hear that I’m not the only person ever to find solace with this one. I am on a mission to someday write an essay (or at least a list) in favor of walking through grief with fiction and poetry recs over nonfiction. These have helped me exponentially more than any nonfiction book, because of EXACTLY what you said— the lack of the same platitudes you see in nonfiction repeated ad nauseam."
6469,kfoctm,3,"Also, so very sorry for your loss. The sea of grief is so wide and overwhelming, it muddles reality and time. As I say about losing my mother— it never gets easier, the waves just get further apart. Ride the waves out. You will survive this. Hang in there, and reach out to your support system if you have needs you can’t meet. I had to have friends stay with me for a whole week because my mom was my everything, and I could t even do dishes or stand some days."
6470,kfoctm,3,"And though I haven’t read it yet, Blue Nights is a follow up that came a bit after this one. Year of Magical Thinking walked Didion through her husband’s jarring death, then she lost her daughter just (I think) a year later, and this is like, book two on her journey through grief. ❤️"
6471,kfoctm,6,Thank you so much for posting this. My dad died in March and the grief is still overwhelming sometimes. I wouldn't have thought to make a post like this but I'll definitely be checking out some of these recommendations ❤️
6472,kfrdsc,14,"Tipping the Velvet, my favorite Sarah Waters book, has toxic relationships in it but it also has a good one. You just have to wait a while.

The Priory of the Orange Tree is also a good one."
6473,kfrdsc,34,"You might enjoy the Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon, or Foundryside by Robert Jackson Bennett. Both are fantasy!"
6474,kfrdsc,3,"[Book of the Ancestor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=Gbg0td3ApT&amp;rank=1) by Mark Lawrence, starting with Red Sister, has a few romances that are healthy but subdued."
6475,kfrdsc,10,I literally just recommended this in another thread but you should definitely check out The Ladies Guide To Celestial Mechanics.
6476,kfrdsc,4,Okay on title ALONE I need to read this
6477,kfrdsc,6,"There's a Chinese lesbian novel I read recently and can't get out of my head. Female general and eldest princess by PDL. The translation can be found on NovelUpdates if you want. The couple starts out being manipulative but they work through that later on. Historical (?) War setting and has cross dressing too, (important info for if you want to avoid that, there's a lot of it). Maybe it isn't what you were asking for but I wanted to put it out there just in case."
6478,kfrdsc,4,The dark wife is a lesbian retelling of Persephone and Hades!
6479,kfrdsc,11,"Just recommended a couple of these elsewhere in the sub, so apologies for seeming like a shrill, but (all fantasy): 

The Tethered Mage series. Really becomes a focus in the latter two books of the trilogy. 

Upright Women Wanted (wonderful book, very focused and emotional)

Seconding Priory of the Orange Tree (more epic in scope but with compelling characters)

The Shadow Campaigns series has some abusive and some healthy lesbian relationships 

Starless - perhaps more properly genderqueer than lesbian, and a bit tortured but not at all abusive or toxic

Some lesbian relationships embedded in Lackey’s Valdemar books, but never really a focus."
6480,kfrdsc,3,"Django Wexler has a few series with w/w relationships. Shadow Campaigns (which I LOVED) has some positive and negative, and I just read A Ship of Smoke and Steel by him which is YA but a very good read."
6481,kfrdsc,4,"The Alpennia books by Heather Rose Jones are historical fantasy set in an Alpine country around 1815. All the stories combine subtle magic and alchemy, adventure and lesbian romance."
6482,kfrdsc,10,Came to recommend Priory of the Orange Tree. It’s a stand along fantasy novel that I desperately would love more of.
6483,kfrdsc,4,"Oh yes I loved that book so much! Very sad that it's a stand alone...

""Fun"" fact: the German translation was released a while ago. They just halved the book and made two separate books out of it. The Englisch book cost me 10€, if I wanted to read it in German the ""two"" books would cost me 40€..."
6484,kfrdsc,3,Written in the Stars by Alexandria Bellefleur is a cute rom com (pride and prejudice like).
6485,kfrdsc,3,"That’s something I absolutely wouldn’t have found on my own and I really like the premise and will definitely be checking it out soon, thanks for the suggestion!"
6486,kfrdsc,6,This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal el-Mohtar and Max Gladstone. It’s a gorgeous novella about two time traveling secret agents who fall in love through writing letters to each other. It’s not entirely “healthy” (they are on opposite sides of a time war lol) but not unhealthy in the way lesbian relationships tend to be portrayed
6487,kfrdsc,3,Untamed 💜
6488,kfrz4e,8,"I don’t know about a book but the podcast the west wing weekly was amazing and gives fantastic interviews with the cast members, crew and public servants who parallel what is covered in each episode. Highly recommend!!"
6489,kfrz4e,3,"I’ll throw out all the kings men. Political, snappy dialogue, personal drama. Pretty close fit I think."
6490,kfrz4e,6,"I think memoirs from the Obama White House (Beck Dory-Stein’s *From the Corner of the Oval* was excellent, as was Samantha Power’s *The Education of an Idealist* with differing levels of policy involved in the narrative) might scratch that itch. If I could offer a piece of probably unwelcome advice, it’s that these books do a very poor job of reflecting the world of politics and may indeed frustrate you more when politics turns out to be less than patriots and devoted public service. 

For great writing with a more discerning (but not cynical) look at politics, definitely check out Jane Mayer’s writing (*Dark Money* is very popular, but *Strange Justice* (which she wrote with Jill Abramson) is probably the best political reporting I’ve ever read), Steven Brill’s *America’s Bitter Pill* (about the passage of the ACA—the rare book that captures the policy, the politics, and the people), Amy Chozick’s *Chasing Hillary* (in some ways, a WH-type memoir from the outside), and (though personally I haven’t read it) Michael Lewis’s *The Fifth Risk*. There are certainly people with good intentions you’ll glom onto in these books, but it’s broadens politics beyond melodrama into something with real stakes."
6491,kfrz4e,4,Profiles in Courage by JFK.
6492,kfrz4e,3,"It's not a book, but The Newsroom is also by Aaron Sorkin and ideologically is very similar to The West Wing. The Newsroom is one of my all time favorite TV shows!

Bookwise, while it's not quite got The West Room vibes, I'm currently reading ""Becoming"" by Michelle Obama and it's really nice to get an early look at some of her and her husband's thoughts, ambitions, and early days in the White House. It follows her life from early childhood up until the end of Barack's presidency. It's divided into three parts - ""Becoming Me"" - ""Becoming Us (her and Barack)"" - ""Becoming More (White House years and beyond)"""
6493,kfrz4e,4,"The Hardest Job in the World: The American Presidency by John Dickerson is a very thorough deep dive into the actual role of the presidency and how the president works with Congress, the Cabinet, etc. It is not necessarily a book that makes me feel hopeful, but it gives me a better understanding of how the role evolved throughout the years and the author does sound confident about Joe Biden when referring to what he did as VP!"
6494,kfrz4e,3,I love this question ... and my only suggestion is common sense by Thomas Paine - I have it and reread it on occasion when I feel revolty
6495,kfw9h7,3,"You didn't mention genre or age range but The Raven Cycle (YA) made me feel exactly how you described.  If you want something more adult, The Surviving Time series by Calia Read (time travel historical fiction) left me mesmerized."
6496,kfw9h7,18,"The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon 

The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern"
6497,kfw9h7,8,Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss
6498,kfw9h7,8,An Ember In The Ashes series by Sabaa Tahir is just so good that you forget about your own life for a second
6499,kfw9h7,7,Outlander series. They are long but not overly complicated or confusing imo. Everyone I know who reads them falls in love with Jamie.
6500,kfw9h7,8,A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J. Maas.
6501,kfw9h7,5,"Same. Took me by storm earlier in the year when I watched the show and read (most of) the books. Magical, but be aware of some potential triggers."
6502,kfw9h7,4,"The only caveat with this is that it's the first book in a (supposed) trilogy, and it's been nearly a decade since book two came out and still no release date for book three."
6503,kfw9h7,6,Anything by Erin Morgenstern is a win in my book.
6504,kfw9h7,10,"Also, Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas. I'm currently on book five. I've been furiously addicted, reading every spare second. I even convinced my husband to let me splurge on Audible. I have a long commute. So, now I'm reading when I can, listening while I drive and sometimes while working. I think I need an intervention."
6505,kfw9h7,3,I get what you mean. I think I need someone to get me to quit my reading addiction :')
6506,kfw9h7,3,I hear you. At this point I think we're all feeling cooped up and digging individual activities for a sense of space. Poor guy just wants to play video games.
6507,kfw9h7,3,I just finished book two last night. I’m in a particularly stressful time in life and these are perfect escape
6508,kfw9h7,4,"If you like fantasy (vampires, witches, and demons) you should try discovery of witches. It's my current favorite. It does have some historical and science details but it is also said by the author that she just does her best with those. I don't think it's too complicated. If you try it our please let me know what you thought! I'd love to have someone to discuss it with."
6509,kfw9h7,5,The House in the Cerulean Sea!!! It’s my favourite book I’ve read this year. Honestly it feels like a warm hug. A hug in book shape.
6510,kfw9h7,3,Favorite book this year. Made me feel all the feels!
6511,kfw9h7,6,I love you!!! It’s ok cuase I’m drjnk
6512,kfw9h7,3,You sound like the tinder profile that just wants someone to take you on an adventure.
6513,kfw9h7,4,I could use that too honestly lol
6514,kfw9h7,5,"{{Strange the Dreamer}}
I don’t know if it’s complicated or confusing (after the first couple chapters it’s not) but I absolutely fell in love with this world."
6515,kfw9h7,3,"I experienced exactly what you're describing with Frederick Backman's Anxious People. 

Finished reading it in one sitting and now I'm looking for more books like that."
6516,kfy2pe,17,It’s nonfiction but Boys in the Boat fits nicely. The main focus of the story is someone trying to make it on their own.
6517,kfy2pe,51,"I felt like The Marriage Plot by Jeffrey Eugenides did a good job of this.

ETA The Atonement by Ian McEwan might fit depending on what exactly you're looking for."
6518,kfy2pe,4,"Nope, too mature for that genre personally."
6519,kfy2pe,69,"
Some of these might work:

- My year of Rest and Relaxation by Otthesa Mosfegh 
- Milkman by Anna Burns
- To Die For by Joyce Maynard
- The Vegetarian by Hang Khan
- A Wild Sheep's chase by Haruki Murakami

A lot of literary fiction but engrossing, mostly female protagonists, but can cone up with some more male focused options. I also recommend the Films Frances Ha and Misstress America."
6520,kfy2pe,186,I would be interested in this too! It feels like there is a huge gap missing between teen stories and adult stories - or maybe I'm just not aware of them?
6521,kfy2pe,35,What about Steppenwolf by Hesse? It’s about the main character rediscovering the meaning of life when he thought he had already seen it all... it’s often read by both those in middle aged and younger old souls
6522,kfy2pe,19,I agree :) I have searched high and low for coping on aging when you are in your 20s and 30s and I know that our peers struggle with this! We get dismissed as being too young but we aren’t!
6523,kfy2pe,68,"Agreed! I'm 23, and YA isn't so relatable to me anymore. But neither are the fiction books listed as catering to adult audiences. A great example for me was attempting to read Little Fires Everywhere. I could not connect whatsoever with the characters."
6524,kfy2pe,5,Loved the marriage plot. It’s definitely a good reflection on growing up
6525,kfy2pe,27,"Totally. I just turned 28, but around 22/23 it started feeling really weird to be in this newly-adult stage. Now I'm only a couple years from 30 and that feels weird as heck."
6526,kfy2pe,8,"I've felt the same way! I don't know any books specifically on coping with age, but I'm 23 and some books I've enjoyed recently and connected with well have been Where The Crawdad's Sing, The Alchemist, Slaughterhouse Five, and Eat Pray love.

The closest book about aging for people our age that I've read is probably Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee. If you've read To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set A Watchman is about Scout Finch as an adult in her mid-twenties, and her identity crisis about marriage vs pursuing her passions and separating her own moral ideals from those of her parents. Pretty relevant to the experiences of twenty-somethings trying to figure out their lives and who they want to be."
6527,kfy2pe,10,That’s exactly what I hear! For me I’m struggling in the face of somehow aging in a world where everything is a dumpster fire 😂
6528,kfy2pe,3,"I’m so glad you empathize, it feels less lonely!

Some of those books are already on my TBR so knowing this, they’ll definitely be pushed to the front 😂 and that’s so interesting about Harper Lee’s other book-I did not know it centraled on those themes..so relevant! Thank you!"
6529,kfy2pe,12,"Yeah! I wonder if it depends on how much you have in common with the author? I mean, I feel a great author could make you feel connected with any character - but it might make sense that reading something a fellow millenial-ish aged author wrote might be easier to relate to since we would have a common generational experience. Maybe I'll have to try searching for writers I have more in common with."
6530,kfy2pe,5,I had my doubts about rowing being interesting to read an entire book about it but it’s one of the best non-fiction books I’ve ever read. And there’s a lot more to it than just rowing which does actually prove to be pretty interesting.
6531,kfy2pe,3,The scene of the Poughkeepsie regatta is some of the finest writing I’ve witnessed.
6532,kfy2pe,9,writers &amp; lovers by lily king
6533,kfy2pe,3,Judy Bloom got you covered.
6534,kfy2pe,106,Severance by Ling Ma deals with being a 20 something millennial especially in late-stage capitalist society. I enjoyed it a lot. It has zombies.
6535,kfy2pe,4,I fucking love atonement.
6536,kfy2pe,7,"Books that especially resonated with me in my early/mid 20s: 

*A Moveable Feast
*A Farewell to Arms
*Siddhartha
*Steppenwolf
*Divine Secrets of the Yaya Sisterhood 
*A lot of books by Kundera 
*Chocolat
*The Vagina Monologues

I’d also recommend checking out some fun urban fantasy series if you want fluff. A lot of them feature younger but totally independent adults as leads."
6537,kfy2pe,3,I disagree. The OP and others (myself included) agreed that this is a legitimate gap in lit representation. We’re stuck between coming of age and midlife crisis. Sit down.
6538,kfy2pe,35,I had an existential crisis after my 35th birthday. I discovered *How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe* by Charles Yu and it helped me so much. It’s funny. It’s deep. And it’s steeped in Buddhism.
6539,kfy2pe,6,"Why Fish Don’t Exist by Miller

Spinster by Bolick 

Dear Sugar by Strayed"
6540,kfy2pe,10,I love this one a lot. Very relatable and a unique variation of zombie.
6541,kfy2pe,33,Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine is about a woman battling loneliness and feeling stuck in her life. I think she’s in her 30s. Good question!
6542,kfy2pe,11,"I rarely see Steppenwolf recommended in this sub, and I came here specifically to recommend it. I read it at that age, and I still feel that book in my bones sometimes, a couple decades later."
6543,kfy2pe,17,I'll second this one. Siddhartha by the same author is also great.
6544,kfy2pe,10,"Theres a burgeoning genre called ""New Adult"" that fits college aged and other 20s-30s but a lot of those books get segwayed into Young Adult because it has a bigger market. If you see a book that sounds up your alley, consider the age (or guesstimate age) of the protag and youve got a New Adult that was sidled into the YA"
6545,kfy2pe,29,I think this is why i read so much as a teen but now that I'm 22 I'm far less interested in reading. Sucks :(
6546,kfy2pe,19,"Check out The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter--And How to Make the Most of Them Now

This book is written by a psychologist and really helps to put into perspective the role of your 20s on your life. It helped me understand my problems are common and practical tools and mindsets to confront challenges in career, love, and health."
6547,kfy2pe,6,"It might be frowned upon now but when I was 22 I was gorging on Hemingway. He was a manly man who had sensitive thoughts and that was all I was willing to entertain at the time. My favorite recent books are “A Little Life” and “On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous”. Im 32. Thanks for forcing me to reflect!

After reading some of the comments and actually understanding OP I remember connecting with “The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P” by Adelle Waldman."
6548,kfy2pe,4,"Cosmos by Carl Sagan. If you get the audiobook, Levar Burton reads it. It helped me a lot with building a larger worldview that I can use when I get frustrated or panic attacks. 

Also Brandon Sanderson books because they’re great to get lost in. 

I’d also recommend poetry because a lot of people have written about it. Although right now I’m having a tough time thinking of specifics, getting a big ass tome of poetry is pretty amazing."
6549,kfy2pe,19,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one! I hit 25 and had what I call a ""quarter-life crisis"" literally on my birthday. I'm 27 now and really struggling with it. Everyone keeps telling me I'm too young to feel this way. Nevertheless, I feel this way and those feelings aren't changing."
6550,kfy2pe,6,"Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino, and How To Do Nothing by Jenny Odell. Both fantastic at framing the weird mix of contradictions that make up being a younger millennial/Gen Z."
6551,kfy2pe,8,"Loved this one. Could not reread it during quarantine, but definitely a post-COVID revisit."
6552,kfy2pe,10,I’m mid 20s and found Sally Rooney to be really humanizing and relatable!
6553,kfy2pe,3,{{Aging Well: Surprising Guideposts to a Happier Life from the Landmark Study of Adult Development by George Valliant}}
6554,kfy2pe,12,As someone who went through a midlife crisis and ran to the Buddhist (ex-christian). Man they seem to have a reasonable answer for every question which was fucking nice for a change. I'll be reading your recommendation.
6555,kfy2pe,6,"Enjoy it. It is fun, but it will cut you. 

I discovered zen, specifically the Rinzai school to really awaken something in me. I don’t know how else to explain it but enlightenment. I was raised Baptist but it just wasn’t enough (won’t get into the church political nonsense). 

Glad you found your path as well."
6556,kfy2pe,13,"I commented this on the post but thought I would copy and paste it to reply to you two so you would be sure to see it:

The Black Obelisk and Three Comrades by Erich Maria Remarque. I've been on a Remarque reading spree lately starting with All Quiet on the Western Front, then The Road Back, and then the two books I mentioned. All Quiet and The Road Back are also great books, just not ones that would apply to your inquiry.

The themes of those books may be a little more existential and romantic than what you're looking for but as an also 22 year old I found them very relatable and relevant to my life."
6557,kfy2pe,4,I just can't get into Sanderson. Tried so many times. I feel like his and my brain find different things entertaining. I think it's because he has so much suffering in his books but he's not able to capitalize on the comedic value of suffering and it leaves the book dry for me.
6558,kfy2pe,11,I had my first midlife crisis as a child. I left home to become a monk. I didn't know where to go or how to get there so I sat at the stop sign at end of the street until my mom realized and retrieved me. I had to wait till I was 28.
6559,kfy2pe,11,"I was raised Southern Baptist but they couldn't explain any of the beliefs. At a young young age I lost faith and started studying philosophy. Got fed up with everything and went to find a master and I did. Now, I follow Drikung Kagyu philosophy. Been working downtown trying to help the homeless but it has no end in sight. So I think I'm going back into meditation."
6560,kfy2pe,5,"{{Tender is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald}} really delves into the mental struggles of an artist during this age period. Also, Ulysses by James Joyce; Stephen Dedalus is in his early 20s and a mental mess."
6561,kfy2pe,5,"I agree! I really liked the Defining Decade - And i liked how the book was split up into different aspects of your twenties (relationships, career etc) and gave real life examples of the author's patients. Wld recommend!"
6562,kfy2pe,15,"I'm thirty-one and have been suffering this for well over a decade. I'm inclined to believe it doesn't go away.
I'd be tempted to say books like Catcher in the Rye or The Bell Jar.
I'd also recommend philosophy. 22 is quite early, I think, to start on philosophy but it's helped me in recent years. Someone else suggested Carl Sagan, which is a great idea. Maybe consider some Stoic philosophy too, which is very accessible and there are some great contemporary analyses too. That deals quite explicitly with growing up.
I'm not sure what else to say other than that I wished I believed 22 to be young when I was 22. I think we're so used to being asked ""what's next"" until you leave University/college that we believe life should be well underway at 22, when really it's just beginning.
Maybe there are some more specific areas about growing up that are bothering you, that there are more specific books about.
Regardless, we all get older. It's natural and happens to us all. Feel free to message if you want to kick some thoughts around. I know speaking existentially can sometimes be difficult with friends and family, especially if they don't feel the same way"
6563,kfy2pe,47,"I feel like all of Haruki Murakami's books capture the feeling OP describes really well, which can be somewhat confronting but also comforting. 'Norwegian Wood' for instance is another great example."
6564,kfy2pe,5,"Bridget Jones's Diary?
It's a bit dated, but very funny. Bridget is a sweet, imperfect, wonderful woman going through a mid-quarter life ""thing"". She's incredibly hard on herself but any outsider you can see all her best qualities. Sound familiar?"
6565,kfy2pe,22,"I recently read NW by Zadie Smith and I think perfectly captures these feelings. It follows several different characters who grew up in a poorer neighbourhood of London and highlight the different ways they struggle with growing up, drifting apart, confronting adulthood, and making life choices in their 20s/30s."
6566,kfy2pe,3,"Of Human Bondage by W. Somerset Maugham. I found that there was something to relate to or to understand in many characters, not just Phillip. It’s very well written and I think it might be what you’re looking for."
6567,kfy2pe,6,Midnight Library and How to Stop Time by Matt Haig.
6568,kfy2pe,5,It’s technically written for people who were in their 20/30’s in the late 1990’s. But Generation X : Tales for an Accelerated Culture by Douglas Coupland covers a lot of this. I’m 27 and related to it.
6569,kfy2pe,3,"Almost Adults by Ali Pantony fits, I think! It follows a group of four friends, around their mid-twenties, dealing with different levels of ‘adult’ life. It’s pretty easy to read, but I found it enjoyable because it is based on characters in their twenties, just trying to figure things out, as they go along.

Also, somehow, ‘I Feel Bad About My Neck’ by Nora Ephron. Which is a memoir, and she’s writing about things from the perspective of being much older, but it made me realise that I’m still young, and I don’t want to waste my twenties/thirties worrying about getting older, instead of enjoying my youth. Which is still hard as each birthday comes and goes, but...I’m young now. I’ll be older one day. It is how time works, and it’s best to just make the most of it, as best I can."
6570,kfy2pe,3,"I am reaching the end of my twenties and most of the non fiction books I read are about self development. It worked pretty well for me. Here are some of my favorites

- The invisible gorilla by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons

- Never split the difference by Chris Voss

- Games people play by Eric Berne

- The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg

- How to make friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie



Otherwise I recommend the book that helped me solidify every cornerstone of my personality and the will to live life : The Collector by John Fowles. It's fiction, it's dark, but if you're a woman who likes art and empathy, and struggles at finding your place in the world, it may just shake you to your core."
6571,kfy2pe,9,"I'm 25, and my SO is 27. We were planning our finances this year, and with this comes the planning of our savings accounts. We realized that, with our salary, if we saved every penny that's not spent on essencial things (rent, utilities, food), we'd manage to buy a house in 41 years, so about the age we'd be retiring lol

I feel your struggle with the dumpster fire world. It sucks."
6572,kfy2pe,19,"Well, if you read it shallowly sure, I thought it was a book about what privilege will and will not protect you from, about grief, isolation, identity, the prize of keeping up appearances and the cold comfort of shallow relationships. It also has some amazing prose.I very much enjoyed it. OP might as well, or they might not, but you are not the objective arbiter of what makes a good book."
6573,kfy2pe,4,"Everything that happens happened because of her inability to accept that she was no longer a teenager while her husband had become super conventional.  I mean I think she is awful, but it could be a cautionary tale of sorts. At least I read it that way. Won't say more due to spoilers."
6574,kfy2pe,4,"Considering reading this one, but just looked at all the negative reviews at goodreads... is it too much about family-related problems? Feels like it has been done to death already."
6575,kfy2pe,3,"Statistics are meaningless here, I think. 23 was honestly one of my worst years. And I never felt older than I did from 22-24. There’s a definite feeling of being “too old” that comes from not being a teenager, but I found I did grow out of it. My late twenties were amazing, and my thirties so far have definitely been better than my twenties overall. It can be a little bittersweet to look back on younger years and wish you still had that body or those options, but age also brings confidence and a better understanding of what you want out of life. From what older friends tell me, each decade is better than the last :)"
6576,kfy2pe,3,"So I said OP isn't at the aging stage and at the tail end of coming of age, and I'm bad and need to ""sit down"".

The you slam dunk me by saying OP is too old for coming of age and not at the aging point yet and you're amazing. 

We said the same thing.

The issue is you're trying to make it into ""lacking representation"" like there aren't books about young people. There are millions. There just aren't books about young people fixated on aging because that isn't the life stage a 22 year old is at.

Lacking representation is an issue that affects marginalized groups. Early 20s is peak representation, just turn on your TV, open any book, look at advertisements. Please stop trying to make this into an issue of wokeness. You're talking about a theme that would be incongruent with the character's developmental stage and a book that would lack mass appeal. I'm sure they exist, but they're not gonna be best sellers and that isn't an issue of oppression of young people."
6577,kfy2pe,7,"Thats absolutely fine! I respect your opinion, this seemed to be a divisive book in general, sorry if I came off as aggressive, I was half asleep and felt like you were painting a broad "" no one can ever like this book"" stroke. Some people will, some people won't."
6578,kfy2pe,5,Isn’t that what Indie music is for?
6579,kfy2pe,3,This is a fantastic suggestion! Her novel Swing Time could also work for this!
6580,kfy2pe,3,"She asked for a book suggestion, not life advice. I'm sure if ""stop trying to plan so much"" was enough for her she wouldn't be here."
6581,kfy2pe,3,"I'm not sure how old you are. I'm 64 and fully agree that not dead yet is good!

However, I also remember bursting into tears on my 20th birthday upon hearing Neil Young sing, ""you can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain, though you think you're leaving there too soon."" My son went through it with a song ""Stay 18 Forever"" by Brand New. 

Find a song to cry over, and then find  hundreds more to dance to and sing along! Do the same with books, and you'll get through your current stage of life and gain insights into the ones past and to come.

It's much harder for you during Covid, but spend as much time as possible with friends, even virtually, and read everything you can get your hands on. 

Meanwhile, try ""The 100 year old man who jumped out the window..."", A bizarre adventure story, present time and flashbacks, that's strange, funny, disturbing and covers every stage of life and might just make you laugh. Read Stephen King, Kurt Vonnegut, Brandon Sanderson and just escape."
6582,kfy2pe,3,"Sure! Keep in mind that these books are more for people already in their 20s so while you read, you might be able to understand but not empathize. When I was 18 I swore that I could not change very much or my life, I was wrong. Each year I get older is another year of adulting levels lol. Hang in there!"
6583,kfy2pe,4,"The Vegetarian! Love this book so much. 

The characters are a bit older (30’s, married) but it really does hit on those existential feelings I’ve felt in throughout my 20s."
6584,kfy2pe,3,And I fucking love the library scene in the movie based on said book.
6585,kfy2pe,28,I’m still in my 20s but when I was in my late teens/early 20s I discovered people were listing books about people our age as New Adult and I found I related somewhat more to those books though it is heavily saturated with romance. You can Google “New Adult books goodreads” and you should be able to find a goodreads list with some books you might like.
6586,kfy2pe,6,Yes same here!!
6587,kfy2pe,3,"Great book. It’s really funny cause my buddy and I each went through our own existential crises. He turned to Buddhism and I turned to stoicism, neither of us realizing how similar they are.

It made sense because he was more of a hot-head that needed to find peace and I was the opposite: too passive and lacking confidence.

Someone said (I think it was Nassim Taleb, not sure) said “stoicism is Buddhism with an attitude”

It’s also kinda funny that due to the connotations we associate with the word “stoicism,” it gets a lot more pushback than Buddhism does."
6588,kfy2pe,3,"I have my hothead tendencies too. I turned more to Rinzai zen, which really helped me to find a oneness with both my peaceful side; and my angry side."
6589,kfy2pe,3,Seconded.
6590,kfy2pe,4,"I second ‘my year of rest and relaxation’ by Otthesa Mosfegh. Are you fishing to read some psychological insight about the usage of SSRI pills? then, you have chosen the right referral as this one. It has covered the entire process involved from finding the shrink to requesting for the additional drugs and then follow up. It felt like am witnessing the clinical trials of various drugs and its effects in a single case study! I can understand the emotional pains of the lead character, but the ending was tragic in my strong opinion and left me in total bafflement. 😣"
6591,kfy2pe,3,"Try *Revolutionary Road* which I found to be interesting in coming to grips with those years of my life. It is a bit depressing, too, so fair warning."
6592,kfy2pe,3,Excellent recommendation. You took the words right out of my mouth.
6593,kfy2pe,3,"I told my wife about this post and she recommends “Girl, Wash Your Face” and “Girl, Stop Apologizing.” She thinks they may be close to what you may be looking for."
6594,kfy2pe,3,I feel the same way about Demian - also by Hesse. It’s about a young boy who meets another popular boy in school who turns out to be a budding sociopath. It’s psychological and fascinating
6595,kfy2pe,5,"Nah, totally normal. I had so much anxiety in my late twenties and then I hit 30 and it just kind of went away. We get really caught up on these numbers but they don't mean anything. Live your life and try to make the most of it and if you can afford it try a therapist."
6596,kfy2pe,3,I just look at it as a different type of rent.
6597,kfy2pe,6,"Don't be too hard on yourself, this is very common these days, especially for middle-class people who no longer marry young or just go into the family business. There is so much pressure to find your ""one"" to marry and fall in love with your perfect career and get your ""dream job."" Of course all of this is mythology, there is no perfect partner, career, or job. Everyone struggles with this, despite the impression they may give on social media or otherwise. People perpetuating this pernicious fiction by pretending to adhere to it only makes it worse.

Take your time, this is normal. Do not put pressure on yourself to achieve perfection, because that is never a good thing. There is a concept in psychology that it is better to be good-enough than perfect. You just need to be the good-enough partner, parent, friend, employee, etc. That way you keep your sanity and get things done. This done by a person not persecuted by their own neuroses are always better.

Learn to free yourself from needing the approval of others and focus on what really makes you happy and you will be way ahead of most people."
6598,kfy2pe,3,"I never read YA books. I started reading Stephen King, Clive Barker, Douglas Adams, etc...in middle school. I find it strange that YA is such a huge genre in today’s world. I know I’m the odd one here but what exactly makes a book YA? Do the protagonists just have to be young? Is it as simple as that? Are most fantasy books considered YA? I often wonder if authors whose books are sold in the YA section are offended by that label because it indicates to me that they are lesser writers than regular authors."
6599,kfy2pe,3,"Publishers tried to make ""new adult books"" happen, and they do exist, but the term didn't really take off. Might be worth googling though.

6609,kfzj23,11,"Terry Pratchett.

Amazing books for many reasons. None of them focus on romance or relationships, but there are some nice partnerships and in particular a totally cliche-less relationship that begins in Guards! Guards! and continues in the background of about 8 books.

If you want any more information about the discworld, give me a shout."
6610,kfzj23,9,"Sunshine by Robin McKinley is one of my favorites. The main character has a romantic relationship, but it's not the focus of the story. There's another couple in the story that just seems very real; not exactly wholesome, but functional and well-established. I actually think all of Robin McKinley's books are great - this is just the one I come back to regularly!"
6611,kfzj23,3,"{{From Unseen Fire}} is set in an alternate history version of Ancient Rome (it goes by a different name but it’s really just Ancient Rome but with magic!) The main character and her love interest both act like adults, have lives outside each other, but are also very supportive of each other on their respective paths. 

{{The Goblin Emperor}} has an arranged marriage subplot that is all about the characters learning to communicate with each other and affection/love happening as a result. There are a couple rough patches if I remember correctly but it’s not really due to immaturity or not sharing vital information. More so just them getting used to one another."
6612,kfzj23,3,"*The Clockwork Century* series by Cherie Priest. It’s a series of Steampunk novels set in an alternate USA where the Civil War never ended. It’s pretty good, and the few romance subplots that happen are very well, and maturely handled, rather than the rom com BS so many authors rely on."
6613,kfzj23,4,"I really love the way romance is handled in The Queen's Thief books by Megan Whalen Turner. There are romances, but not every main character pairs off, and the romances feel unique and real. Also there are lots of other really powerful relationships!"

Citizen by Claudia Rankine. 
I think this book gave a great overview of the Black experience in this country. 

Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson. 
This book tells the story of southern Black people moving north to escape Jim Crow and seek better opportunities. I personally relate to these stories as my mother's side of the family moved up north during this time. 

The Ways of White Folks by Langston Hughes. 
A collection of short stories that are sometimes funny sometimes dark examples of the obsurdity of race relations in this country. 

Not history related but if you wanted to read some black fictional stories the Patternist series by Octavia Butler is highly highly recommended."

Slavery by another name- 	
Douglas A. Blackmon
 Amazon review I thought summed up the book better than I could. 
-Through painstaking detail and heartbreaking stories, this book sheds light on the systematic, calculated, and willful creation of a system of ""neo-slavery"" that replaced slavery after it was supposedly abolished. What this book exposes is profoundly disturbing, and is a devastating indictment of what the United States of America purposely did to its new black ""citizens"". If it were possible to forgive the original sin of slavery, it is impossible to forgive what occurred after slavery. It is a crime against humanity that has never been fully exposed, acknowledged, prosecuted, or punished.

Slavery was not abolished. It was simply (and predictably) replaced by an even more devastating system of legal, codified oppression that made the incarceration of ""free"" black men, a desirable and profitable practice, and a central component of economic prosperity for white businesses. ""Laws"" were created specifically to fine and arrest black men so their ""debt"" could be sold to white businesses who would in turn use the men as forced laborers. The demand for this cheap labor was insatiable. Black men were arrested for ""talking too loud"" in front of a white woman, or being ""disrespectful"". Many were arrested without even being charged - that's how blatant the practice was. Vagrancy laws were also created and used for the sole purpose of ""rounding up"" as many black men as possible to feed this new system of slavery. Many of these men died working in unspeakably brutal conditions in mines, foundries, plantations, and railroads. This system was a brutal manifestation of how whites viewed blacks, a view that, like it or not, is still at the core of American consciousness."

Check out “so you want to talk about race” by Ijeoma Oluo. She’s legit amazing. 

Dr. Ibram X Kendi has great books on the subject. How to be an anti racist is the best imo, stomped is great as well. He’s really fact and history based.

There’s a fabulous book called White Fragility by Dr Robin DiAngelo - she works in diversity training and has some great insights on race that she herself works on every day to improve. Here’s one of the best parts of the book, her “rules of engagement” https://www.uua.org/files/pdf/d/diangelo-white_fragility_and_the_rules_of_engagement.pdf

There’s a treasure trove out there, books by authors of color are obviously more important to support, but it is always good to hear from white folks who see their status and privilege and try to help break it down for readers. I’m a big fan of being a good ally, and highly recommend reading some of the former slave accounts by the likes of Frederick Douglass or his contemporaries. Dude was a bad ass. We can all do better as humans. Way to be!!

Whilst older, MLK’s Letter From Birmingham Jail is available free online, and I believe you can also find essays by bell hooks, Angela Davis &amp; James Baldwin for free too, which might be good entry points due to their shorter length &amp; continuing relevance.

Also the independent publishers Verso Books &amp; Haymarket Books made a selection of their ebooks on racism free in the past, so they are worth checking in on in case they do so again in the future if you are on a budget. Both also have many many titles on racism &amp; other social issues, so could be good places to look for recommendations!"
6716,l9ltu1,6,"[Yup](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/new-jim-crow-book-ban-prison.amp.html) Not everywhere, but it exposes so much discrimination and inequality inmates realized how some of them are there for BS reasons. It’s a very thorough an extensive look at the criminal justice system and will leave you shell-shocked."
6717,l9ltu1,4,"I found {{Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race}} really helpful, the author explains systematic racism using a combination of anecdotes, historical events, statistics, and recent events. It's also written in a style that's almost conversational which makes it easy to follow.

Edit: The book is written from a British perspective, but the idea systematic racism can be applied to a lot of countries. I'm not from the UK but it was still valuable insight."
6718,l9ltu1,3,"Read Dr. MLK, Malcom, James Baldwin, Ibram X Kendi, Ta-Nehisi Coates. Watch (many are on Netflix): I Am Not Your Negro, Let the Fire Burn, the 13th, Freedom Riders, Slavery By Another Name, the Central Park Five (or When They See Us, or both). 

There are many more. I know it’s already been recommended but Ibram X Kendi’s Stamped From the Beginning is what I would recommend starting with as it gives a pretty comprehensive history and is a very easy &amp; enjoyable read (also the audio book is read by the author and great- free on Libby)."
6719,l9ltu1,5,"A lot of good recommendations above and will just second a few:

James Baldwin’s work is very poetic, powerful, and heavy but necessary “the fire next Time”

Malcolm X’s speeches should be listened to, but his autobiography is also essential and easy to read. Besides the autobiography read “February 1965: The Final Speeches”

Angela Davis’s work is extremely powerful and currently relevant given the rising popularity of abolishing police. Read “Are Prisons Obsolete?” Very short and powerful. Also check out her interviews on Democracy Now!

I highly recommend Frantz Fanon’s work but it is much more difficult going. A short but important article/speech is “Racism and Culture” if I could sum up the importance basically “racism is a system”

(I would avoid “white fragility”)"

6726,l9n7r9,38,Red Rising series
6727,l9n7r9,15,Read the first and enjoyed it. Maybe time to read the second!
6728,l9n7r9,144,"I would suggest ""The Martian Chronicles"" by Ray Bradbury. It sets these heavy themes and atmospheres of humanity wanting to conquer Mars and discover the Martians. But the emptiness and void of the martian ruins are sooooo well put out, along with other stories, make this book one of the greatest I have read. Not the best plots but definitely, Bradbury knows how to weave a story.

Warning: its a short-story collection but stories do end up intertwining!"

6731,l9n7r9,17,"The Martian is hard sci-fi with a good amount of humor and technical details, based on that you'd probably like Packing for Mars by Mary Roach (nonfiction, a funny journalist interviews a bunch of experts better understand what is involved in space travel, an easy read, very informative but also funny) or maybe Seven Eves by Neil Stevenson (hard sci-fi, relatable human characters, darker tone)"
6732,l9n7r9,6,Try Stephen Baxter - {Manifold: Time} (first of the manifold series).  It’s very hard sci-fi and if that’s part of why you enjoyed the Martian you’ll find a lot of it in Baxter’s writing.
6733,l9n7r9,53,"Though it's not a survival book, I can definitely recommend Weir's second novel, *Artemis.*"
6734,l9n7r9,6,It's a wild ride!

&gt;Follow a motley crew on an exciting journey through space-and one adventurous young explorer who discovers the meaning of family in the far reaches of the universe-in this light-hearted debut space opera from a rising sci-fi star.
&gt;
&gt;Rosemary Harper doesn’t expect much when she joins the crew of the aging Wayfarer. While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain.
&gt;
&gt;Life aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy—exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn’t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny Wayfarer crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs—an experience that teaches her about love and trust, and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe.

6766,l9n7r9,23,"{{Leviathan Wakes}} and then then the following  books and novellas. The final installment is out this year.

Aside from the Epstein drive that enables quicker space travel the physics are rock solid and there is a constant survival theme throughout for the humans that colonised the asteroid belt. Cannot recommend it highly enough. The audio books are phenomenally narrated too!

When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, the Scopuli, they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for—and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.

6768,l9n7r9,10,"That's because The Martian was about survival and engineering in extreme envirionmental conditions. Artemis is about survival and economics is extreme sociological conditions. Not disappointing at all. I thought is was near the same level as the Martian, but the scope is completely different."
6769,l9n7r9,3,"Survival and a Journey?  As a followup to The Martian?  Hooo boy have I got the ABSOLUTELY PERFECT book for you.

*Seveneves* by Neal Stephenson.  

Please trust me.  If you buy this book, start reading it, and are not hooked **by the end of the first sentence,** literally DM me, and I will buy the book off you and pay for you to ship it to me, and I’ll gift it to someone.  It’s that good.

And don’t be intimidated by the length of the book, it’s an absolute page-turner, not nearly as dense as my other favorite book of his, *Cryptonomicon*.

And I won’t give any spoilers, but if your three criteria are “survival”, “a journey”, and “followup to The Martian”, this is exactly the book you want."
6770,l9n7r9,6,"I could be wrong but I feel like you are asking for a real page turner with exciting realistic setups - and maybe sci-fi and/or Mars is required? If so, I’d suggest nearly anything by Michael Crichton. If you’ve never read him, start with Jurassic Park and you won’t be disappointed. Significantly different from the movie and it’s pacing is incredible."

The main character though, it was just so tiresome to follow her along what could've been a great story. I think that was mostly the let down for me. I spent most of the book annoyed at Jazz."

&gt;Civil war looms in the Bobiverse in this brand-new, epic-length adventure by Audible number-one best seller Dennis E. Taylor.
&gt;
&gt;More than a hundred years ago, Bender set out for the stars and was never heard from again. There has been no trace of him despite numerous searches by his clone-mates. Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender’s fate - whatever the cost.
&gt;
&gt;But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob’s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bob’s plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverse’s problems.
&gt;
&gt;Undaunted, Bob and his allies follow Bender’s trail. But what they discover out in deep space is so unexpected and so complex that it could either save the universe - or pose an existential threat the likes of which the Bobiverse has never faced.

6806,l9o3vd,3,"Not sure if this is the type of thing you’re looking for, but “All My Puny Sorrows” by Miriam Toews is about a woman caring for her sister with depression. It’s not so much about the day to day care, but more about the emotional challenges of loving someone who wants to die and the choices that come along with that. Toews does a good job of creating a realistic family dynamic filled with love and dark humor that really made the book enjoyable despite its subject matter. I found it comforting in its honesty about the severity of mental illness. Whereas most stories tend to sugar coat a situation or end on easy conclusions, Toews isn’t shy about the fact that mental illness often needs constant management just like many other illnesses. If you’re looking for something optimistic or inspiring though, this is  probably not that. Spoilers below that go into more detail about crucial plot turns and the ending, so you can decide if this is the type of thing you’re up for.

&gt;!The sister does eventually commit suicide, and the main character accepts this as the progression of her sister’s illness. The main character also briefly considers taking her sister to another country so that she could go through assisted suicide, but ultimately doesn’t get the chance to make a final decision about this. I’m not a huge fan of this ending or the message it sends about dealing with mental illness, but do think that the story is told well. Everyone’s story is different, so I would hope that no one takes this as the only possible outcome for people with depression. It looks like other people here have already linked some good resources, so I won’t try to act like I know the right advice to give in this situation.!&lt;"

6814,l9oola,3,The rise and fall of DODO
6815,l9oola,3,Currently reading this and I was going to suggest it as well.
6816,l9oola,5,"I liked them a lot, too, but I think the reason (for me) is that Crouch is so damn good at developing a concept and exploring its full potential. It’s virtuosic plotting, because Crouch can surprise you over and over but still play fair. I liked the Wayward Pines books, too, though not as much. Most of his stuff is pretty good. 

As for comps, I’m drawing a blank. Stephen King gives you a great opening concept, and his characters are better developed, but the plots tend to unravel. Michael Connelly is a near-perfect crime thriller writer, but he’s not going to blow your mind. For sci-fi and speculative fiction I tend to lean toward more literary writers like Margaret Atwood and Jeff Vandermeer, but they don’t have that relentless pacing of Blake Crouch. 

Andy Weir’s books are good at using real science in a fun and digestible way, and I think Artemis was an especially well-plotted heist story, but again, will not blow your mind."
6817,l9oola,5,"Wayward isn’t the same kind of mindblowing as the other two, but it keeps you guessing throughout and there are some really good twists. It does make you think a bit about love and life, but keeps things on the shallower end. I could definitely see a difference in the writing quality, but that would be expected for an author’s earlier work."
6818,l9psas,7,"Patrick O’Brian’s [Aubrey-Maturin series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40333-aubrey-maturin) is fantastic. It follows a British naval captain and a surgeon during the Napoleonic wars, and it is definitely a long series."

6820,l9psas,4,{{Sarum}} is a great telling of the history of England via one locale.
6821,l9r47v,4,"“In the darkness that’s where I’ll know you” by Luke Smitherd 

Good mind bender.

I also like “Girl On The Train”"
6822,l9r47v,7,"The Contortionists by Robert H Van Wagoner, beautiful writing and way more deep thinking than I ever expected to find in a psychological thriller. It is a character driven novel about a family in distress when a 5 year old goes missing. As such, it isn't action or page turning right of the bat (or really right until about 3/4 of the way through). It lays bare cognitive dissonance as related to religion or conforming to social expectations. (In this case the setting is in Utah. The family is a mix of Mormons and Ex-mormons going through this crisis together, and all that comes with that). 

I definitely said ""holy shit"" when it all came to a climax. It not only is the what, but more importantly the why and how that left me floored.

&gt;Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.
&gt;
&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.
&gt;
&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.
&gt;
&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.

Omg, I used to go visit my grandmother in the Bay Area - Petaluma, and one magical summer I discovered her library- it was filled with first and second edition hard cover books and amongst them was Rebecca... I discovered a new world that summer- “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.”  So gothic /noire /romantic- 🤓"
6857,l9zerb,3,"I really got into Castaneda when I was in my teens too- it reminds me of traveling with my dad to Death Valley and my grandparents cabin at my Whitney- I love the way he dove into the mysteries of the shaman and way of the warrior, such mysteries of different cultures and religions are something I’ve always been drawn to and my dad had all his books (amongst many others!) they always fascinated me- I liked journey to Ixtlan best : 
“We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same”"
6858,l9zerb,3,"Lolita —- I said so as well- and it’s a fascinating fascination of how beautifully a narrative can bring both a feeling of revulsion and disgust as well as a humanity and the empathy of the monster who knows he’s a monster, suffering, knowing that redemption is not possible- and it’s like a dream with a wretched wake up call- but Nabokov is one of, if not the most important authors of the 20th century. In my humble opinion. “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.” That opening sends shivers"

6862,l9zerb,3,"Mmmmmmm- yes this is a major theme throughout his books - and the core teachings of Don Juan is that there is such a fine line between what is experienced as “reality” and what is dreaming- or in some cases hallucinating! - but I love that concept- for a while I was even remembering to look at my hands in a dream and was able to lucidly dream ( I chose to fly , natch. 🧚🏻) so to respond to your comment I think that’s one of the most important things to take away, is perhaps to question reality - and to alter your own to shake yourself out of a stagnation or whatever it means to the reader. Those were some self help for me. 🙏"
6863,l9zerb,10,"The first person I thought of. Glad he's the top comment :) 

East of Eden is the book to me. The best book I've ever read and the greatest book I've ever read. I was scared that it would overshadow the rest of his bibliography (wasn't too crazy about *Of Mice and Men* when I first read it), but I finished the Peal the other day and I'm in the middle of *The Red Pony.* Good stuff. 

Definitely one of the greats."
6864,l9zerb,3,"Why the Chamber of Secrets over the rest of the series? Not hating! Just curious. 

I'm more of a *Prisoner of Azkaban* person myself, but I think the best ones are either *Order of the Phoenix* or *Deathly Hollows.*"

6869,l9zerb,3,"His novels are absolutely beautiful. And I imagine the writing is even more magical in Spanish - I read it in English.  :)

Love in the Time of Cholera is also mesmerizing."
6870,l9zerb,3,I haven't read that one but Chronicle of a Death Foretold is awesome and makes you feel kinda desperate. Also if you liked One Hundred Years of Solitude I recommend No One Writes to the Colonel because they are connected.
6871,l9zerb,4,"It's hard for me to describe it and avoid being insulting.

The writing is very, very basic; the characterisation is almost non-existent with characters seemingly only entering the book to make gnomic announcements and then walk off-stage again.

But most of all my complaint is with the central message of the book as, while it's a short fiction novel, it's also treated as a form of self-help. It's been about a decade since I read it but iirc it roughly states that if you wish for something enough and dedicate yourself to it, the universe will magically conspire to make it happen for you somehow. That message is basically the prosperity gospel rewritten for a more new-age crowd; and it's nonsense.

It's even worse in that it suggests in order to achieve this ""personal legend"", you have to want it so bad and be so narrow minded about it that you cannot listen to criticism (or even your own doubts) ever. As a corollary, people who don't achieve or attain their legend/dreams must clearly not care that much. So it encourages an unfalsifiable conviction in whatever the heck happens to be your aim/dream and a certain callousness about others. The lead character in the book finally meets the love of his life and abandons her; her aims and wishes in life immediately subordinate to his own and she pretty much goes ""oh you need to fulfil your dream and I have to accept that"".

To me it read like 100+ pages of magical thinking and excuses for narcissistic behaviour."
6872,l9zerb,3,“A Little Life” crushed me. It’s by far the most emotionally devastating book I’ve ever read. (But tw for nearly every traumatic thing that can happen)
6873,l9zerb,4,The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas
6874,l9zerb,4,"Elena Ferrante!! Her Neapolitan quartet will satisfy a lot of your likes, and she’s just a fantastic scene-setter."
6875,l9zerb,3,"No offence taken; there's 7+ billion of us walking this earth and certain ideas will talk to us all in different ways. And there are ALWAYS more books to read.

I will grant that *The Alchemist* is also mercifully short so, even if you find yourself hate-reading it, it'll be over soon enough and you can argue about it online on reddit :P"
6876,l9zerb,19,Gotta love Money Dick
6877,l9zerb,5,"I read The Grapes of Wrath in 1985, it remains one of my favorite books. I read Of Mice &amp; Men a few years ago.

I started East of Eden last summer, I'm still plowing through it, it's a huge book and I just don't have as much time to read as I did a few years ago. But it's such a great book, I'm determined to finish it even though there isn't one happy moment in the whole narrative so far (I'm at the part where Adam Trask has houseguests taking shelter from the rain, Lee is ready to leave &amp; the twins are around 11-12 years old).

Sometimes it seems as though I'll never finish......but I know I will eventually."
6878,l9zerb,4,"I'm a voracious reader of non-fiction, but I will list my five favorite books--and four of them are fiction:

* Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell
* The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck
* Christy by Catherine Marshall
* A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith
* In Cold Blood by Truman Capote"
6879,l9zerb,3,"Under historical fiction, I would suggest The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck."
6880,l9zerb,3,"You should absolutely try 11/22/63 by Stephen King and Dark Matter by Blake Crouch.

Also, I would recommend reading some Brandon Sanderson books like Mistborn Trilogy if you want a 5-star Fantasy read."

&gt;Why have people from different cultures and eras formulated myths and stories with similar structures?

Jordan Peterson offers a provocative new hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what rituals, myths, and religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology, cognitive science, and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative, Maps of Meaning presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.

&gt;Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. 
&gt;
&gt;Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human—and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.

6929,la5b6l,15,"[**The Just City (Thessaly, #1)**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22055276-the-just-city)

^(By: Jo Walton | 368 pages | Published: 2015 | Popular Shelves: fantasy, science-fiction, fiction, sci-fi, philosophy | )[^(Search ""The Just City"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The Just City&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;""Here in the Just City you will become your best selves. You will learn and grow and strive to be excellent."" 
&gt;
&gt;Created as an experiment by the time-traveling goddess Pallas Athene, the Just City is a planned community, populated by over ten thousand children and a few hundred adult teachers from all eras of history, along with some handy robots from the far human future--all set down together on a Mediterranean island in the distant past.
&gt;
&gt;The student Simmea, born an Egyptian farmer's daughter sometime between 500 and 1000 A.D, is a brilliant child, eager for knowledge, ready to strive to be her best self. The teacher Maia was once Ethel, a young Victorian lady of much learning and few prospects, who prayed to Pallas Athene in an unguarded moment during a trip to Rome--and, in an instant, found herself in the Just City with grey-eyed Athene standing unmistakably before her.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, Apollo--stunned by the realization that there are things mortals understand better than he does--has arranged to live a human life, and has come to the City as one of the children. He knows his true identity, and conceals it from his peers. For this lifetime, he is prone to all the troubles of being human.
&gt;
&gt;Then, a few years in, Sokrates arrives--the same Sokrates recorded by Plato himself--to ask all the troublesome questions you would expect. What happens next is a tale only the brilliant Jo Walton could tell.

&gt;In the late seventeenth century two penniless young Frenchmen, René Sel and Charles Duquet, arrive in New France. Bound to a feudal lord, a “seigneur,” for three years in exchange for land, they become wood-cutters—barkskins. René suffers extraordinary hardship, oppressed by the forest he is charged with clearing. He is forced to marry a Mi’kmaw woman and their descendants live trapped between two inimical cultures. But Duquet, crafty and ruthless, runs away from the seigneur, becomes a fur trader, then sets up a timber business. Proulx tells the stories of the descendants of Sel and Duquet over three hundred years—their travels across North America, to Europe, China, and New Zealand, under stunningly brutal conditions—the revenge of rivals, accidents, pestilence, Indian attacks, and cultural annihilation. Over and over again, they seize what they can of a presumed infinite resource, leaving the modern-day characters face to face with possible ecological collapse.

&gt;Some stories cannot be told in just one lifetime. Harry August is on his deathbed. Again. No matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes. Until now. As Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. ""I nearly missed you, Doctor August,"" she says. ""I need to send a message."" This is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.

7079,la5b6l,3,"So having the same issue, I would recommend the Kinsey Millhone series by Sue Grafton (A Is for Alibi, etc). It used to literally break my brain trying to understand how, say, a police detective could get information from someone. I couldn’t imagine just knowing how to ask the right questions. (When I played Nancy Drew games, thank fuck you just got to click on the next question as a multiple choice). I think those books helped me see how to get people to open up, make stupid small talk, and that it’s okay to ask something that seems like a waste of time (“Do you remember anyone else who used to hang around that place who might have known her?”) and that those “stupid” questions can make or break the whole encounter.

&gt;Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen. 
&gt;
&gt;The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature. 
&gt;
&gt;A high-action story written with a poet's hand, The Name of the Wind is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard.

But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to Howl—and herself—than first meets the eye.

From a different perspective, anything with Rincewind (particularly The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic) for a cowardly main (male) character who nevertheless has a lot more to him underneath.

&gt;The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door.
&gt;
&gt;Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.
&gt;
&gt;One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, ""None of what’s going to happen is your fault"". Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: ""Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world.""
&gt;
&gt;Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.

*Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-Five Years of Being a Black Poet* by Nikki Giovanni

ANYTHING by June Jordan but the collection of essays titled *Some of Us Did Not Die* is a great place to start

*Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol* by Nell Painter. Probably all of us think we know about Sojourner Truth but this crucial biography confronts much of the white-washed history of an extremely important figure. 

*Spectacle: The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga* by Pamela Newkirk, about the story of a man, Ota Benga, who was used in an anthropological exhibit at the St. Louis World's Fair. This is a book that tells an individual's history but doesn't stop there. This book is potentially very triggering, I would read about it before deciding to pick up a copy yourself.

ANYTHING by Saidiya Hartman but especially *Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Riotous Black Girls, Troublesome Women and Queer Radicals.*"
7221,lalehm,3,"Yes! I just read **The Color of Law** by Richard Rothstein last week. Highly informative, I 100% recommend it to everyone (and have!). I learned several things that I had assumed but never thought about (the Fair Housing Agreement and HOA's being founded in racism and being exclusively for lower class whites rather than all lower class no matter their skin tone). While those mortgages are technically no longer legally standing, the fact is that many people can look at their house deed and see that it still restricts sale to ""Caucasians only""."
7222,lanajb,99,"Not sure if you're okay with YA, but I find that it helps me sometimes to read something simple or even complex to get out of my own head and read about another time or life. My favorites are: 

\- The History of Jane Doe by Michael Belanger 

\- Holding Up The Universe by Jennifer Niven 

\- Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens 

\- We All Looked Up by Tommy Wallach 

\- The Sun &amp; Her Flowers by Rupi Kaur 

\- Mosquitoland by David Arnold 

\- The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd 

\- Turtles All The Way Down by John Green 

\- It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover 

\- The Sun Is Also A Star- Nicola Yoon 

I hope these help! :)"
7223,lanajb,17,"Wow. Makes sense. It's been a very long time since I read YA, but I think that can really take my mind off things. Thanks a lot!!!!!"
7224,lanajb,26,"Man's search for meaning by Viktor Frankl really helped me when I was depressed. It was a short book so didn't take me much time or effort to go through which was what I needed at the time. The Book by Alan Watts was also good and made me appreciate myself a little more. This is a short book as well! 
I hope this helps and you find something that works for you :)"
7225,lanajb,279,"When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron. 

Non-fiction and so so beautiful. I read it when my depression was at its peak. It’s not a magical fix for depression, but it was like a warm and loving hug and I felt so validated reading it."
7226,lanajb,30,Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman. This book is all about escapism. It's all about getting back to normal after an extreme shift in living conditions. Hope things get better.
7227,lanajb,80,"The Midnight Library by Matt Haig. This book had me hugging all my family members, dogs included and ugly crying big tears at the end. WARNING though, this books starts out dark and does talk about wanting to die. If you can handle reading through the dark, it’s one of the most beautiful books I have ever read for feeling grateful and alive."

7229,lanajb,77,"It might help to read about cognitive behavioral therapy.  That's often used in therapy for depression and anxiety, and can give you some therapeutic tools that you can use on your own."
7230,lanajb,12,Okay! Thank you for the suggestion!
7231,lanajb,183,"The Discworld series by Terry Pratchett.

Different than others people have listed, it's a fantasy comedy series, but it's mixed with a philosophical pragmatic optimism. Great series to get you to laugh and remove yourself a bit to the left of reality, while also being introspective on reality, oneself, and what actually makes a good person.

 Man, soul music, and The Hogfather are three good ones to read together (My favorites). Guard's Guard's or The weird Sisters are also good starting points."

7238,lanajb,33,"How did I know this book would be recommended here... I just finished it and thought it was *so* shallow.

I was expecting a novel that really dug into dealing with regret. &gt;!But the regrets that Nora undoes aren't centered around mistakes she's made, but around morally neutral life choices. (The death of her cat was almost an exception, but it's quickly revealed that Nora didn't do anything *wrong* here: the cat just died.) She never tackles the kinds of regret that actually keep people up at night: objective mistakes that lead to hurt feelings, broken friendships, financial discomfort, ruined reputations, etc. In other words, the novel didn't even try to address the question of how to deal with the regrets *that are actually worth having*, which seems like a pretty significant oversight.!&lt;

It was a fun, quick read that was a fine way to pass the time....but I personally didn't think it lived up to the hype or premise."

7243,lanajb,3,"The Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson 
First book is The Way of Kings

The main characters deal with a lot, and each one is ""broken"" in their own way. I found it spoke to me a lot.

Also, there are some *amazing* support communities on reddit. I don't know what you're going through but I'm sure you'll find one on here where people who are going through similar situations can help you talk it out.

I hope your future is sunnier."
7244,lanajb,3,Thanks for the recommendation and thanks a lot for your wishes :)
7245,lanajb,6,Couldn’t recommend this enough! I read the way of kings during a tough time in my life and Kaladin’s bouts with depression was so relatable. This series is a compelling journey and I couldn’t be happier I picked it up.
7246,lanajb,17,"Same.  I was super annoyed with how heavy handed it was.  Zero subtlety or real thoughtfulness.  And I hated how she lives these wildly different lives due to the slightest change in decision.  For most of us, we wouldn't have been a successful rock star because of one decision or a scientist because of another (Brian May could be an exception).  I was annoyed with most of it, and never felt like who the main character is, was ever really explored.  Things seemed to happen to her but she never seemed to actively do things herself or express a personality- I had zero feel for her.  It came off as a pretty shallow attempt at a philosophical novel."
7247,lanajb,50,"Anything by Jenny Lawson.  Her books deal with her mental illnesses (depression and anxiety, I think) and get very honest.  But she balances that with joy and hilarity and her fantastically funny take on the world.  Maybe finding someone who has these daily struggles and who has created a really lovely life for themselves will help.  I have an advanced reading copy of Broken which is coming out in a couple.of months and it is just great.  But, Let's Pretend This Never Happened and Furiously Happy are both complete gems and hilarious.  I recommend her audiobooks as she narrates them."
7248,lanajb,6,"I’ve been in a similar place recently. Deep immersive long series are great. It all depends on what you like. If you give us an indicator of what kind of genre your interested in we could help out more.

I’d recommend to everyone to read anything by Michael Moorcock. All of his fantasy series are in one, connected multiverse. Sort of like marvel but totally bad ass.

He does science fiction, fantasy and more high brow literary fiction."
7249,lanajb,3,Thank you! I'll definitely give it a read :)
7250,lanajb,7,"Makes sense!  I used to love fantasies and I think I still would love to read those that are YA but about people who are in their 20s maybe? And I haven't really been reading a lot to be completely honest and the few of the books that struck a chord with me are A Man called Ove, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, and Normal People. Anything that is a little realistic? Idk what genre these books come under, but yeah. But I also loved the Subtle art of not giving a fuck, Hyperbole and a half. Thanks for your suggestion, I'd definitely check it out :)"
7251,lanajb,7,Check out mistborn
7252,lanajb,3,I would check out sapiens if you haven’t already. It’s one of the most successful non fiction books of the last decade
7253,lanajb,21,"I agree with r/jefrye. In addition, this book may be difficult for people who have (1) suffered trauma, (2) are not coming from a place of privilege, and/or (3) deal with persistent, severe, and intractable depression. 

&gt;!A great deal of emphasis is put on Nora’s ability to choose and how she feels about her choices. One of the (many) difficult aspects of coming to terms with trauma is your lack of choice and how trauma restricts and shapes future choices. Additionally, though Nora experiences some truly difficult life events comes, she’s lived a life of privilege that affords her the ability to make choices not everyone has. I understand Haig’s decision to write Nora as a person of privilege and what it allows him to do; however, as I read the book, I kept thinking about how it would come across to someone who did not have Nora’s privilege. To someone living in poverty, for instance, I suspect it would fall somewhere on the spectrum from laughable to painful. Finally, the message of the books comes awfully close to suggesting you pull yourself up by your bootstraps and just choose to be happy. That’s a dangerous narrative, particularly for people with chronic and severe depression. Nora’s depression is described as “situational” and “mild to moderate with a touch of despair, and I think this book probably has the most to say to people who match that description.!&lt;"

&gt;Compassion and particularly compassion towards oneself can have a significant impact on our wellbeing and mental health. Developing our sense of compassion can affect many areas of our lives, in particular our relationships with other people. In this book, Professor Paul Gilbert explores how our minds have developed to survive in dangerous and threatening environments by becoming sensitive and quick to react to perceived threats. This can sometimes lead to problems in how we respond to life's challenges and scientific evidence has demonstrated that compassion towards oneself and others can lead to an increased sense of happiness and wellbeing - particularly valuable when we are feeling stressed. Based on evolutionary research and scientific studies of how the brain processes emotional information, this compassionate approach offers an appealing alternative to the traditional western view of compassion, which sometimes sees it as a sign of weakness and can encourage self-criticism and a hard-nosed drive to achieve.

7270,lanajb,11,"Long immersion in fantasy settings helps I think, a big suggestion would be The Kingkiller Chronicle. Also Percy Jackson, Narnia, The Grishaverse, The Night Circus, Stardust, The Graveyard Book. There's one I'm kinda not sure to recommend because the saga really was kinda &gt;!shite!&lt; after that book, but fuck it, Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass)... I read that book when I was at a very low point of my life &gt;!like the protagonist and I felt better seeing her get better!&lt;, soo there's that, and don't expect MUCH maybe.

And hey reddit stranger, hang in there, I know it doesn't seem like it will, but things will get better, for real, there are still dreams and things you have and you will be able to accomplish them even if you think right now you won't. For real, I can attest to that. Not to make this much longer but there's a quote in Bojack Horseman that I love: ""It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day, that's the hard part."""

However: I found it a quick and easy read and of course a book like this can shed some light on things like depression but nothing more really. The most interesting thought from this book (for me) is that whatever you do, or whatever choice you make, there will always be things you like about your life and other things that you don't, key is how you deal with all this. If you want to dig into this topic, there are many books on this: the happiness trap (by Russ Harris), when things fall apart, the subtle art of not giving a fuck (Mark manson), and I'm sure there are many more. I also recommend The Choice by Edith Eger."

7321,lanajb,3,Took me a long time to have sympathy for Okonkwo.
7322,lanajb,25,The Tiffany Aching books (his YA Discworld) brought me the most comfort. They’re “YA” but they unflinchingly handle some dark stuff with grace and humor.
7323,lanajb,17,"I'll also second Discworld. Although it's usually classified as ""fantasy comedy"" or ""satirical fantasy"" (and Pratchett himself once called it ""an antidote to fantasy""), this doesn't really do the series justice. It's set in a fantasy world, but it's mostly a very large (41 books total) collection of stories about being human. A distinctive characteristic is that the Discworld characters generally *understand* that they live in an absurd universe.

There are several ""sub-series"", and you can pretty much start with whichever you want. There's one about the wizards at Unseen University (which starts with ""The Colour of Magic""), one about the witches living in the countryside (which starts with ""Equal Rites""), one about Death (which starts with ""Mort""), one about the city guardsmen at the fabled twin city of Ankh-Morpork (which starts with ""Guards! Guards!""), one about the gods (which starts with ""Pyramids"") and even a YA series about a young witch-in-training (which starts with ""The Wee Free Men"").

If I should recommend a starting point for a person who's feeling low and hopeless, I'd say the Death sub-series. This might sound a bit odd, and is probably the kind of statement that calls for a little justification, so I'll give a spoiler-free one: The Death of the Discworld - although he is literally the Grim Reaper - is not an evil creature. He likes humans (although he doesn't always understand us that well), lives in a cozy cabin outside of time and space with stray kittens he's adopted, and sometimes bends a rules a bit if he can get away with it (and some of his stories are about him getting into cosmic trouble for that). Many of the Death stories both get their humour and their philosophical values from him looking at humanity from an outside perspective. A core point in all the Death series is that even if life might be meaningless in a grander sense, it's still wonderful because we can't help but keep filling it with wonders. His first story is ""Mort"" (in which he takes in a young boy to be his apprentice)."
7324,lanajb,7,This sounds really adorable. Sounds really nice.
7325,lanajb,3,"The stormlight archive books by Brandon Sanderson. The main characters are constantly dipping in and out of hopelessness— the author did an amazing job of describing the fight against mental illness, addiction, the need to always be perfect, and things like PTSD and Survivors guilt. 

I’ve cried while reading them. I’ve read them more than once."
7326,lanajb,10,anything by alan watts. he really gave me a new perspective on life itself. it seems like i can feel deeper but without getting lost in it since i read him
7327,lanajb,4,"My favourite was always 'Catcher in the Rye'. A lot of ppl don't like it, I guess because it was taught in school for some people, but it helped me deal with a lot of my emotions when I read it"
7328,lanajb,10,"I also find so much comfort in the works of Thich  Nhat Hanh! 
PS OP if you use audible, many audible of Thich are available for free.

7330,lanajb,3,A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles
7331,lanajb,3,It's one of my favourite books. Really life affirming.
7332,lanajb,3,Try the Way of Kings. One of the main characters has depression.
7333,lanajb,4,"If you listen to this one on audiobook, you can hear the compassion in her voice as she reads it!"
7334,lanajb,25,"Since there are many wonderful non-fiction and self-help suggestions here already, I’ll just list my favorite distraction from the sadness books: 

1. Anne of Green Gables (I recommend the whole series, do not stop and the first book :))

2. The Secret Garden. It never fails to motivate me 

3. Re-read your all-time or childhood favorites. The familiarity can be a great distraction from depression or sadness."
7335,lanajb,7,I've been meaning to read Anne of Green gables for quite sometime. I'll probably listen to the audiobook on librivox in the night or something? I'll give secret garden a read. I've read some really good things about the book. Thanks for the recc :)
7336,lanajb,4,"The audiobooks are great! 

For the first book I definitely recommend the Audible original with Rachel McAdams if you have a subscription. She’s a great  Anne!"
7337,lanajb,3,"Thank you :') I guess this person was trynna help too, though they probably didn't understand what I wanted"
7338,lanajb,4,For sure! It is a really nice depiction of mental health issues regardless and definitely a good book!

7344,lanajb,13,"I'm very confused about the way Reddit talks about YA. I often see people calling a book YA when I'm certain it's not. For example where the crawdads sing. Am I missing something? I thought YA meant the story was written for young adults. More along the lines of Twilight, the fault in our stars, and the hunger games."
7345,lanajb,3,"Came here to say this, such a great read. I recommend to everyone!"
7346,lanajb,4,"HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA!!

Literally it made me smile the whole way , the happiest most wholesome and precious book I’ve ever read. Plus it’s a quick read!"
7347,lanajb,3,"Easy, my favorite book of all time: Paulo Coelho - The Alchemist."
7348,lanajb,3,The Four Agreements by don Miguel Ruiz always brings me back to a balanced place. A quick read.
7349,lanajb,5,"In terms of managing anxiety, I've gotten a lot of benefit from breathwork. (Specifically a 4-7-8 pattern, in to a count of four, retain for seven, breathe out for a count of eight through pursed lips, repeat four or five times. I find that as I practice this one, the sense of relaxation that I get on the out breath becomes more accessible and familiar.) 

James Nestors Breath is a good book, but I do think there's a lot of woo there. Despite that, I did read the whole thing very closely and took notes on the entire book to refer to later. (it was a library book)

I've also gained benefits from tapping. Jessica Ortner's got some that I liked well enough to buy my own copies, but at first I got mine from the library. She's also got videos on Youtube, showing what to do. It's sometimes called Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), and there seems to be a lot of videos out there, but I liked Jessica's the best. She and her brother have a lot of stuff for sale on their website, but I found enough free content that I never bothered getting spendy. 

The shorter form of tapping also has helped, just pat your thighs with your hands, left hand left thigh, right hand, right thigh, for several minutes. It sounds dumb and pointless, but somehow helped me get the worst of my anxiety under better regulation. (There's some sort of brain science explanation for it that I'm not qualified to make). I've also found that sometimes tapping the steering wheel with just an index finger, left, right, left, right, can be helpful too.  

Others have mentioned Feeling Good, and I agree, it's a great resource in learning your way through depression. 
I also found Mark Williams The Mindful Way through Depression a big help. It comes with an audio cd of guided meditations. He's got an audio book of the same materials designed as an eight week course that I found very helpful. 

Another thing I read that I have found helpful was Lori Gottlieb's Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. It really helped me figure out the role I need to play in my own recovery, but also to have more realistic expectations of what I can achieve. My recovery is an ongoing process that uses some techniques I have learned to help me calm my anxiety and retrain my habits towards a healthier future. 

For example, negative self talk and overly harsh self criticism is a problem that I still struggle with, but I'm definitely making real progress. 

Breathwork and mindfulness have been very helpful. 

Another more obscure author is Pauline McKinnon. She's Australian, working with the techniques of Ainslie Meares to help people over come anxiety. I found her book In Stillness Conquer Fear to be very well written and helpful. I found an audio guided mediation of hers on Youtube and bought a cd of it on Amazon (in a cd of assorted techniques by various authors). Also got a download of a longer practice directly from her website but IMO, it's virtually identical to the shorter free one, just pause the recording for ten extra minutes when there's a quiet pause towards the end.

Sorry to ramble, but this subject has been very much on my mind ever since I really did find some techniques that helped me. Is life perfect? No, I'm definitely learning."
7350,lanajb,3,"True, I’ve used it in working with adolescents!
There are so many CBT based workbooks out there, and probably the closest thing you could get to therapy at home."
7351,lanajb,3,I’m 85% done this book and I have to agree. It has me wanting so much more from it. I feel frustrated that they aren’t exploring more of who Nora is. It’s all just hobbies and interests changing and her reaction to it.
7352,lanajb,3,"I second this book. This book single handedly took me out of a really bad phase. 3 years later, I still think about it and read a few of the letters."
7353,lanajb,3,"I sincerely hope you find some relief. 

The short form tapping seemed pointless to me, and it took forever for my counselor to describe it well enough that  I was able to understand that for that one, there's no particular mindset to be in, no breath pattern to follow, no mantra, nothing but the slow, slow tapping. 

Some get-it-done-right-or-just-stay-home part of my brain kept trying to make it complicated, but it is very simple. 

I like the fact that the slow tapping and the 4-7-8 breathing are something I can manage when I wake up from a nightmare, or just generally wake up with a racing heart. Being able to fall back to sleep has been a big help. 

Oh,and as long as I'm rambling, I'll say that I have deliberately shifted my reading habits away from long, immersive fantasy sagas. For example, Robin Hobb's Farseer series is extremely well written. Beautifully crafted. Why don't I want to immerse myself in that world? Because much of it is so very dark, told from the perspective of a main character whose mind has been deeply affected by what he's managed to live through. Not trying to get spoilery because it is a good series, but I do want to convey that his interior journey is just depressing, IMO. Ultimately a great story, but wow, so dark and interior. Pretty much the opposite of the sort of thought patterns I'm trying to cultivate. Yes, it's amazing that a great writer can get inside the head of someone else so completely, but on the other hand, I've found great benefits from getting out of my own head. 

In that sense, I've deliberately cultivated some craft-y hobbies, actual things to do. My craft projects are large enough that I can't complete them in one sitting, simple enough that I was able to quickly acquire the basic skills required to start, varied enough that I can design my own goals and simply play with color. (I first started cross stitch embroidery, then added sewing and quilting as the pandemic reminded me of my sewing machine) 

As another form of self care, I highly recommend finding an immersive hobby that can fit within your lifestyle and personal interests. Doesn't matter what it is, really, just that you enjoy it enough that you become absorbed in the work and the play of it. 

As long as I'm rambling, I'll say that the Feeling Good book basically lays out a series of things you can do to help yourself. Good nutrition (including omega 3 and Vitamin D), good sleep habits, a bit of exercise, socializing (challenging but doable these days, thank goodness for the internet), combined with the breath work, mindfulness and otherwise good self care and cultivation. 

It sounds like a lot, but I do think the main goal is to train yourself out of the habits of mind that feed into an anxiety spiral and depression. It's do-able. 

Oh! I've also found that keeping a journal has been helpful, specifically the Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll. Look online for his website and videos. There are tons of youtubers out there making a career of decorating their journals, but the most minimal sort of bullet journal has been a really big help in doing what I need and want to do to help myself. I read his book and took notes cover to cover for future reference after finding it at the library. He's got ADHD, and developed the method to help himself cope. Sharing his methods seems to have helped a lot of others get their lives under better regulation. 

HTH!"
7354,lanajb,6,"Im sure this will get buried, but here's my rec. 

The Tale of Desperaux and The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane. Both are children's/middle grade books by Kate Dicamillo.

These books took me through the darkest. most horrid parts of my life. I was suffering from abuse and depression that came with it, as well is isolation and loneliness. Both books touch on existential themes that range from what it means to love others/what it means to love yourself, what our life's purpose is, and the value of going on and continuing to live even in the darkest moments. I used to read this and just cry and cry (in a good way) They were exceptionally healing and I still read them when I am hurting.

I feel so strongly about these as therapeutic books that if you wanna drop me your address I am happy to send you both."

7356,lanajb,4,I've always wanted to read the Discworld series but became way too intimidated on where to start.
7357,lanajb,3,"You absolutely can/please do! I am in an amazing place at this time, even tho things like anxiety and depression can still creep up! Both books in paperback are under 10$ on Amazon from what I know. I hope they help. I know its a super weird recommendation, but I think sometimes when we are working through problems, having life's complexities worked out through a warm voice in a gentle and simple way...makes a huge difference."
7358,lanajb,3,"Yeah, honestly I’m not sure. I mean the rest of the books I listed are YA books, but the crawdads book isn’t I suppose. I just read it as a teenager- but I know plenty of adults that have read it. Honestly, as I am not an adult, I still read YA books and still am just as interested in them so I don’t think that you’re ever too old to read them"
7359,lanajb,8,"A bonus for US redditors with library card-this series is available free on Hoopla, which most libraries offer through their digital programming"
7360,lanajb,3,"These were recommended by my therapist:
The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris and Bev Aisbett
There's a comic version which is kinda cute but it's a helpful book that teaches you CBT methods. 

I also really like Brene Brown. She has some good tedtalks if you feel like watching something but plenty of books as well. She deals a lot with feelings of shame."
7361,lanajb,3,"Glad to help. 

In terms of learning new things, I practice at just enjoying the process. I have perfectionist tendencies and letting myself be 'good enough' at something instead of needing to be the best ever, is a pretty good way to start. 

The 4-7-8 technique is really just that simple. When feeling anxious, take a few moments to breathe in to a count of four. Retain the breath to a count of seven, then release it to a count of eight. The goal is to have a longer exhalation. It's got something to do with calming yourself. All I know is that the cumulative effect of having practiced it seems to make the habit even more effective. Or maybe I'm just calmer and notice the effect more. Either way, it works well for me. 

You're quite right about how being in an anxious state can interfere with the process of being able to think what to do that'll break the cycle. 

Just try a few things and see how they affect you. Then try a few more. No need to be perfect. :)"
7362,lanajb,6,I came here to recommend this. Such a good book.
7363,lanajb,3,"This isn't a self-help book, but The Alchemist by Paulo Cohero really helped me. It's the language that it's written and it feels like on of the stories that you used to listen when you were a child. It was a wonderful escapade."
7364,lanajb,12,Also how to stop time by Matt haig
7365,lanajb,5,You've compiled a very nice list. I'm in my thirties and still read and write YA. There's no age limit!
7366,lanajb,3,"I recommend this book to anyone dealing with trauma whether it be internal or external. Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. 

Viktor (as if I’m friends with him) was a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps. During his time there, aside from facing unspeakable horrors, he managed to develop a personal philosophy built off existentialism that played a huge part into why he survived. As a result, his philosophy is beautifully written and presented in his book Man’s Search for Meaning.

The book is full of one liners that will just make you stop and think.  As a collective whole, it will do the same but make you go, “Shit! If this man can survive a concentration camp, I can clean my room.”"
7367,lanajb,3,Haha nice! I am definitely giving this a read :D
7368,lanajb,3,"I’m currently almost finished with Active Hope by Joanna Macy and Chris Johnstone. It’s specifically about keeping hopeful in the face of ecological breakdown, but I think the psychological mechanisms mentioned apply to lots of different parts of life. I highly recommend it."
7369,lanajb,3,"I was about to recommend her book, definitely a great read :)"
7370,lanajb,3,Thank you!! I'll be sure to read it!!
7371,lanajb,3,KKC because your newfound need for DoS to release will force you to persevere lol
7372,lanajb,5,"Since reading it the first time, I’ve read it every January. As weird as this sounds, I use it as a motivational book for the year. It helps with setting goals, sticking to them, and of course, living this thing we call life. 

Also, just search for it on Google. Plenty of free PDFs out there. Hell, if you want, I’ll send you my copy. I’ve enjoyed sending it out to people. Some have even highlighted parts of the book that resonated to them. The only request I have is that you promise to send it back to me. Yes, I don’t know you, but if we don’t have faith in our fellow man (or woman) then do we have anything? Anyway... I’m digressing. Just hit me up with a DM if you’d like for me to mail it to you."
7373,lanajb,3,"Yes! I use the Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)book and it’s very useful. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life and this book has helped a lot. Not a fun read book per se, but kinda self help"
7374,lanajb,3,"I'm not sure if someone's already mentioned this, but I would recommend The Brother's Karamazov by Dostoevsky. It is without a doubt the most intense book I have ever read, and I have gone back to certain passages many times over the years."
7375,lanajb,3,"Sorry if I missed it above, but The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune and Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman are both my go tos with this kind of mindset. The House is like a warm cup of cocoa or a great hug—it’s enchanting and sweet and funny. Eleanor is a lot darker, but it’s so relatable and the overall story is great."
7376,lanajb,3,"i don't know if you're keen on reading french, although it also exists in english but it's way less powerful but i'd recommend L'Etranger by Albert Camus! it really gives me a feeling of comfort and compassion, and mostly, it helps me to keep hope when i most lack of it or when i feel things are falling apart all around me without being able to do anything about it: because that is the plot of the book, that life does not have any sense at all and thus you can do whatever you want. 
 it gives me the amount of strength and hope i need to embrace life again whenever i read it :)"
7377,lanajb,14,"Literally most of his books.

7378,lanajb,5,Anyone have a link to a free copy?
7379,lanajb,3,"A book I turn to in my darkest moments is “I know why the caged bird sings”. I find Maya Angelou’s writing beautiful and inspiring. Although the themes can be psychologically difficult, I find that it gives me inner confidence and helps me process emotions.

7381,lanajb,3,I just read The Secret Garden for the first time since I was a child and it was a sweet ray of sunshine
7382,lanajb,3,"There’s an app called Woebot that teaches CBT techniques and helps you unpack distressing or unproductive thought patterns. It isn’t perfect but give it a try, I found it a lot easier to use than books on CBT or DBT."
7383,lanajb,8,"this book was required to be read and tested on in the beginning of my sophomore year, it brought the class together!"
7384,lanajb,3,"The Alchemist by Paul Coelho

Edit: à bit of  a spiritual book about the little beauties of life and following Omens / dreams. Pages are quite small and it's only 150 of them. I ready it in three days over Christmas."
7385,lanajb,4,"When I was on the speech team in High School, I performed a piece from the Teenage Soul edition called Cookie Cutter Hands. It was a dramatic piece that I had to memorize and give to a group. It’s an incredibly sad story, bug spoke so much truth about mental illness and self harm. I made a few judges cry. Little did people know how much I was struggling mentally and how cathartic it was reciting it."
7386,lanajb,4,"I agree with you. I read furiously happy and found it really bland, boring, and uninteresting. It was like she was trying too hard to be weird. I get that mental illness takes you to some strange places, but FH read to me like someone who wanted to make a joke out of it. I really didn't care for it."
7387,lanajb,3,I find myself returning to The Neverending Story (Michael Ende) over and over throughout the years because of how easy it is to read and how relatable the main character is. It's especially nice to read if the edition is pretty.
7388,lanajb,3,"I have gone back and forth about recommending this book to people that have trauma or depression, but I really do believe that if you can make it to the end of this book it will change how you perceive the world around you. In a really good way."
7389,lanajb,3,The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. This book made me realize so much about life
7390,lanajb,3,"I second Lost Connections by Johann Hari, such a helpful and comforting book!"
7391,lanajb,4,wow ... my boy gave this to me when I was in the midst of heartbreak. I never read it but the other day while cleaning my room I flipped through the pages and now I understand why he gave it to me. awesome read.
7392,lanajb,4,"Ok, whew, glad I’m not the only one. Yeah, she was trying for shock value it seemed like, without much substance"
7393,lanajb,3,Midnight Library literally saved my life this year
7394,lanajb,3,Came here to recommend this. This book made me feel all warm inside. I cried tears of joy the whole way through.
7395,lanajb,3,I second this. Reading it now.
7396,lanajb,3,"For ACT (similar to CBT) try The Happiness Trap, by Russ Harris.

My therapist recommended it to me and it's the only positive I got from therapy. I find it very hard to relate to a lot of traditional CBT/ACT techniques, but the book gave me some really useful perspective. It's very gentle with the reader"
7397,lanajb,3,"It has an interesting concept (though there are some issues with world building, which I won’t get into here!), and it’s an easy read that’s fairly enjoyable. And it does have a positive message, and for many people, that positive message will be exactly what they needed to hear (which is *great*). However, it has its limits, and I think many people who go into it expecting a life-changing read will find that it does not address their lives or their problems. So maybe the key is managing expectations and taking what you can get from it, because it does have something to give."
7398,lanajb,5,"You can start anywhere and you should. 

They’re all good as standalone except maybe the Aching books-maybe read those in order. There are several “HowToRead” and reading order charts out there but you can ignore all of them and just enjoy the book in front if you. I originally read them mostly by release date because I was given Mort just after it’s release in 1987 and was then chopping at the bit for each successive novel. When I go back to reread its been by character grouping or by release date and by every other reading order the interwebs will spit out for you as well as just the one I felt like that day. Sometimes I go and read just one scene. 

If you like fantasy or don’t and have a quirky sense of humor you’ll probably love this amazing body if work. Yes I’m a HUGE fan. The day he died I bawled like I’d lost my best friend and after reading his cast of characters for 28 years I weirdly had. When the last Aching book came out I didn’t read it for months because I knew that was it it was over... it is the one Pratchett book I have never reread. 

These books will make you laugh out loud and feel better about the world... at least they always do that for me. And don’t forget Carpet People. It’s my favorite."
7399,lanajb,3,"The ""Libby"" app can also give you free digital books if you have a library card. Much of Brene Brown is available at least in my area on Libby."
7400,lanajb,3,The House in the Cerulean Sea is my go-to for feel good books. It feels like being wrapped in a warm happy blanket. Hope you find some good soon &lt;3

It’s funny you make this request because I started the book last night and thought about buying it for my grandfather.  If this book doesn’t interest you, maybe there is a book about something in your family lineage that you can connect over. My grandfather is Irish which is why this book reminded me of him.

The world becomes easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard, It makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe - comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy.”

Return to Killybegs, translated from the French, by prize-winning novelist Sorj Chalandon, tells the story of a traitor to his tribe, the Catholic community of Belfast, emerging from the white heat of a prolonged war during the 70s and 80s in Northern Ireland. This powerful work, lauded by critics, shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt and awarded the Grand Prix de Roman de l'Academie Francaise, is on a subject that touches a nerve for most Irish people: the all-too-human nature and circumstances of betrayal and survival.

It's a little hard to describe without getting spoilery but here goes.

Four guys playing a role playing game stupidly get their players killed by poison when they  mix mushrooms and beer at a pub.  The NPCs at the pub see them die and in going through their belongings realize they were on an important quest and decide they have to finish it to save the kingdom.   From there the story follows both the NPC characters and real world people who begin to realize something is weird about their role playing game.   This is why is a little hard to explain without being spoilery as both worlds are real yet not all the characters are real . . . . It will all start to make sense as the series goes on.

7523,lb1dgi,9,I'm currently reading *Twilight of Democracy: the Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism* by Anne Applebaum.  This was published in 2020 and speaks to examples worldwide of the rise in populism.
7524,lb1dgi,15,"I guess the issue you have here is that no one really labels themselves as a 'rightwing populist', the only people who would actually use that term are people who wish to attack an individual / group / set of ideals. My point being it would be very difficult to find an unbiased insight into the rise and popularity of new right-leaning groups in the West.

You could start by asking yourselves what each of these groups have in common in terms of policy. For instance, a lot of the groups you may be referring to tend to be anti-globalist, perhaps you could look for books exploring the pros and cons of globalism and internation blocs such as the EU. Why did working class communities in the UK vote to leave the EU? the affects of multiculuralism and open-door immigration, accountability in politics and the pros / cons of local, representative democracy etc. I would say books around Brexit would be a great, practical place to start.

I don't have any specific examples, because I think all you need to do is take an unbiased look at most 'western' nations these days.  What started as seemingly-innocuos 'political correctness' back in the 90s has now metastasized into the insanity that currently infests academia, media and pop culture.  The main tenet of which seems to be 'don't believe your lying eyes'.  I think the rise in so-called right-wing populism is based on the simple fact that so much of what's happening right now violates common sense, and huge swathes of the population are feeling very alienated and disenfranchised  by this.  I guess a reasonable example to start with is to look for how many times people are called 'Nazis' or 'fascists' these days and for what reasons.  Then decide for yourself if those folks might not be happy with the current state of affairs and get behind a leader that taps into that."

Also, read biographies about people who inspire you! That always helps me feel like I want to do more."
7545,lb1kgg,8,"I give the same recommendation to every request like this: {{Kitchen Confidential}} by Anthony Bourdain. It’s *technically* memoir about a young cook navigating the grimy underworld of New York restaurants. 

But it’s *actually* about not knowing what to do in life, searching for your passion, finding your passion, trying, failing, succeeding, more failing, giving up, trying again, failing again, succeeding again; partying, camaraderie, love, addiction, depression— the good times, and the bad. It’s funny, honest, raw. I think about it every day. I find self-help books to be reductive; I found bourdain to be real, and in being real, inspiring."
7546,lb1kgg,5,Lots of good advice here but remember much is accomplished by just getting started. Don’t overthink it. Don’t expect a home run. Just move and savor moving. It will lead to more.
7547,lb1kgg,3,"This is a good one. I've read a handful of self help books over the last few months, and so far this is the best one at providing clear, actionable advice that doesn't feel overwhelming. Another one I really liked that I felt similarly provided actionable advice is Buy Yourself the F*cking Lilies. What I loved about this book is that it puts self help/habit formation in the context of self love. In other words, change your habits not because you hate yourself but because you love yourself and want to be better to you. It's like your best friend and life coach all rolled into one."
7548,lb1kgg,5,"Take a job, any job. There, winning. As I got older I realized that if I’m doing no harm, working, paying my bills, keeping my house in reasonable order, being decent to my friends/family I’ve won. The incessant goals-oriented, constantly seeking upward advancement, more, more, more is just...draining. I jumped off that train. Good luck to you in 2021."

7564,lb7j37,5,"Fantasy is a pretty broad term but here is some recommendations of different categories 

Classic fantasy, Lord of the Rings: I can't have a fantasy recommendation list wothout this trilogy. It has great characters and a world that feels alive and is filled with detail. One reason you might not like this is because it's writing is old school and takes a while to get into but it's totally worth it.

If you want some amazing magic, Mistborn: This is mich more modern and eazy to get into. The magic system is probably the greatest I have ever come across. If you want oceans eleven type team on a fantasy world with a great female lead this is for you

Urban fantasy: The Dresden File. This series is not finished, but most books are completely stand alone. It also one of the greatest and most well realised protagonists. It's pretty light hearted and fun, but not without some darker and more serious moments. There is some great action and humour. I highly recommend the audiobooks.

Dark/realistic fantasy: The First Law Trilogy. This one is similar to Game of Thrones in it's tone. The world is dark, people die, no one is totally good or bad but in the middle. The plot isn't the focus, but the characters are excellent. They are deeply flawed and some may feel like villains but they feel like real people. I highly recommend it if you are more into characters than plot."

Excerpt: Talking to Dragons is a young adult fantasy novel, the fourth and final book in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles by Patricia Wrede. It is told in first person from the point of view of sixteen-year-old Daystar, son of Cimorene, a woman who lives at the edge of the Enchanted Forest. Cimorene raises Daystar and teaches him legends about the Enchanted forest, swordsmanship, spells, and magical protocols. One day, Antorell, a member of the Society of Wizards, who has a grudge against Cimorene tries to assault them. Then, Cimorene melts Antorell with a spell, which raises many questions in Daystar's mind because he didn't know that his mother could do any magic. However, Cimorene refuses to answer Daystar's questions, and goes into the Enchanted Forest to retrieve a sword, and gives it to Daystar. She then sends him into the forest telling him not to come back until he can ""tell her why he had to leave."" When Daystar enters the forest, he meets a talking golden lizard named Suz, who tells Daystar that the sword Cimorene gave him is the Sword of the Sleeping King. Daystar, confused about what all this can mean, is instructed by Suz to ""follow the sword."" Trying to find a place to spend the night, he enters the middle of a ring of hedges and finds a young fire witch named Shiara, who can sometimes do fire magic but can only do it periodically. The wizards heard about her lack of control and kidnapped her. However, she burned the Head Wizard's staff, ran away to the Enchanted Forest, and got caught in the middle of the hedges. Daystar tells Shiara about his quest, and she decides to accompany him. Afterwards, when Daystar shows Shiara...More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=689457

&gt;At the edge of the Russian wilderness, winter lasts most of the year and the snowdrifts grow taller than houses. But Vasilisa doesn't mind—she spends the winter nights huddled around the embers of a fire with her beloved siblings, listening to her nurse's fairy tales. Above all, she loves the chilling story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon, who appears in the frigid night to claim unwary souls. Wise Russians fear him, her nurse says, and honor the spirits of house and yard and forest that protect their homes from evil.
&gt;
&gt;After Vasilisa's mother dies, her father goes to Moscow and brings home a new wife. Fiercely devout, city-bred, Vasilisa's new stepmother forbids her family from honoring the household spirits. The family acquiesces, but Vasilisa is frightened, sensing that more hinges upon their rituals than anyone knows.
&gt;
&gt;And indeed, crops begin to fail, evil creatures of the forest creep nearer, and misfortune stalks the village. All the while, Vasilisa's stepmother grows ever harsher in her determination to groom her rebellious stepdaughter for either marriage or confinement in a convent.
&gt;
&gt;As danger circles, Vasilisa must defy even the people she loves and call on dangerous gifts she has long concealed—this, in order to protect her family from a threat that seems to have stepped from her nurse's most frightening tales.
&gt;
&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale is a magical debut novel from a gifted and gorgeous voice. It spins an irresistible spell as it announces the arrival of a singular talent.

7639,lbb7v4,14,“The Fire Rose” by Mercedes Lackey! She has done a few “twisted” fairy tales. This one is her take on Beauty and the Beast and I found it enchanting. It’s set in America in 1906 and it incorporates magic and newly developing technology and a neat love story. I have a hard time putting it down every time I read it.
7640,lbb7v4,7,"""Clockwork"" by Philip Pullman for a VERY quick but gorgeous read – it's a kid's book but is the definition of a classic-feeling fairy tale.

""The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue"" for something that skews less fairy tale and more modern fantasy, but has romance in it that is nothing if not gush-worthy. (There is definitely sex in it, though it's never focused on enough to be grossly explicit or anything.)

If I remember well, the Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander has a very adorable and cute main love story that is threaded throughout the five books. Totally a subplot, but if you like fantasy anyway, the five books are middle-grade and will go fast."
7641,lbb7v4,9,"Amazing fantasy book with a hilarious take on fairy-tale tropes, but FYI it's not a romance until the 2nd book! I guess that doesn't matter if you read the whole series, but I have always been super attached to the first book and can't remember the last time I've read the others. They're all sort of stand-alone, it's not like an epic trilogy where nothing is resolved until the end."
7642,lbb7v4,4,"The Snow Child by Eowyn Ivey felt magical to me. 

The Night Tiger by Yangsze Choo was a darker dream too"
7643,lbb7v4,9,"[The Last Unicorn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29127.The_Last_Unicorn) is very good, definitely a classic."
7644,lbb7v4,32,And Fairest by the same author. Ella is my favorite but Fairest is my sisters. Both are good!
7645,lbb7v4,3,I just finished the Ickabog by J. K. Rowling and really enjoyed it.
7646,lbb7v4,3,School for Good and Evil is one of my favorite reads 💕
7647,lbb7v4,4,I'm not OP but I surely will enjoy several recommendations from this thread hahah
7648,lbb7v4,5,I just want to be able to look back at this thread
7649,lbb7v4,18,The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer
7650,lbb7v4,7,"Look no further, OP. Ella Enchanted is IT. Then you get to watch the movie after :)"
7651,lbb7v4,4,The cruel prince series
7652,lbb7v4,6,"I loveeeeee the movie Ella Enchanted! It was one of my absolute favorites. I don't think I've read the book though. If I did, it was when I was much younger"
7653,lbb7v4,3,"The Goose Girl by Shannon Hale 

I’ve been re-reading it for around 10 years 😁"
7654,lbb7v4,31,A lot of Neil Gaiman books feel like adult fairytales.
7655,lbb7v4,16,"Anything by McKinley, and a lot of things by Hale."
7656,lbb7v4,8,"The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern. Very modern fairy tale-ish writing. The romance isn't the main story line, but it's there and lovely. Read it with my book club and everyone came to the conclusion it was a fantastic escape from reality right now."
7657,lbb7v4,3,Oh I LOVE Shannon Hale books!
7658,lbb7v4,4,"Yes, her futuristic fairytales are the best! And her book Heartless is a stand-alone about the Queen of Hearts."
7659,lbb7v4,7,"Okay, The Golem and the Jinni wasn't at all what I had in mind when I posted this. That said, I **have** to read it. It sounds so enchanting! Was this a popular book that I just happened to miss? How did you come across it, if you don't mind me asking?"
7660,lbb7v4,12,"I did read fairest when I was younger, and I remember loving it. I never realized they were the same author that wrote Ella Enchanted though! I'm assuming Ella Enchanted came first?"
7661,lbb7v4,26,"Omg where is The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern?? It’s usually all over this sub, for good reason! It’s a beautiful book that you get lost in no matter how many times you read it. Highly recommended, OP!"
7662,lbb7v4,7,Yeah! Ella Enchanted was published about 9-10 years before Fairest. I also have a book of short stories/fairy tales written by her as well.
7663,lbb7v4,6,"I'm a little skeptical to read Howl's Moving Castle because of Tuesdays at the Castle, a middle grade novel supposedly based on that book. I obviously wasn't a fan. That said, I've had Howl's Moving Castle recommended to me a lot, so maybe I'll end up trying it out. It's certainly getting a lot of support on here! Thank you!"
7664,lbb7v4,3,"The Sugar Queen by Sarah Addison Allen is a sweet fluffy story, but it’s been a minute since I read it. I really don’t remember anything sexual in it."
7665,lbb7v4,7,"the lunar chronicles by marissa mayer, basically a retelling of cinderella, little red riding hood etc. ofc everyone ends up with someone (in a pg way) and it's pretty good writing too :)"
7666,lbb7v4,20,"I have read Howl's but not Tuesdays at the Castle. But I just Googled it and they sound nothing alike, other than the presence of a magical castle. Maybe some characters are similar? But I think you should be fine. Especially since the author is totally different: that's like saying you read some bad fanfiction, so you don't want to try the original thing.

Anyway, it sounds like you have lots of great options! I hope you find something you enjoy!"
7667,lbb7v4,7,"Already read it, and though it does not have any real romance in it, it's a beautiful book! If anyone else is reading that just wants fantasy I highly recommend it"
7668,lbb7v4,3,"If you ever do want something more adult, and darker, try reading the comic series FABLES by Bill Willingham. It’s fantastic and did the “Once Upon a Time” show concept *before* the show - and executed it much, much better imo.

For another book that definitely is for an adult audience but has a very fairy tale or Arthurian romance feel, I’d recommend The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is a collection of short stories that is the start of the Witcher book series.

Happy reading!"
7669,lbb7v4,3,"I second this! Although, I think it’s called Enchantment. It’s been a few years, but I was just thinking of rereading it."
7670,lbb7v4,28,"I do have to say, the book is VERY different from the movie. The book is so good! I used to like the movie until I read the book haha"
7671,lbb7v4,23,The Two Princesses of Bamarre also by Gail Carson Levine! This one is my favorite by her.
7672,lbb7v4,3,"Yes I think it is, but a great fairy tale"
7673,lbb7v4,4,"It was one of my favorite childhood movies too, and if anything the book is even better. The movie follows it very closely in dialogue and plot and characterization, and the book has the added advantage of some really beautiful narration and more details about the characters that didn't make it into the movie."
7674,lbb7v4,3,"The Hollow Kingdom by Clare B. Dunkle 

Keturah and Lord Death by Martine Leavitt

MeruPuri by Matsuri Hino

Fruits Basket by Natsuki Takaya"
7675,lbb7v4,8,"I love fractured fairytales, retellings, etc and had just finished The Forbidden Wish by Jessica Khoury (an amazing retelling of Aladdin.) The djinn mythology really piqued my interest so I found a Goodreads list with djinn novels and randomly picked this one. I listened to it on audio and it has great narration as well. I just felt totally and completely absorbed into that book. It reminded me of what reading for enjoyment and pleasure was really supposed to feel like, after having been in a long reading rut. The historical fiction aspects were great to learn some more about the origins and mythology of golems and djinns. The sequel is coming out this year as well! I have no idea how popular it really is but I rarely see it mentioned. It deserves as much love as The Bear and the Nightingale, Uprooted, Deathless and other novels that are somewhat similar."
7676,lbb7v4,3,"What about some good ol’ Tolkien? Beren and Lúthien is great! 

When curing the books for the screen, the screenwriters for Lord of the Rings decided to enrich Arwen’s role in the movies by conflating her and Aragorn’s stories with Lúthien and Beren. So the romantic elements of Aragorn and Arwen in the movies are pretty much straight from that story."
7677,lbb7v4,6,"All of her Elemental Masters books are based on fairy tales, and I shamelessly love them all."
7678,lbb7v4,8,"The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune is my FAVORITE book! It has all the elements you're looking for. I've been recommending it to everyone I know. Please, please, PLEASE read it! You won't regret it."
7679,lbb7v4,9,"Oh my god thank you so much. I read book 1 ages ago before the others came out, but then forgot what it was called and have tried to find it again to no avail. I am so excited to read 2 and 3!!! Seriously, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
7680,lbb7v4,3,Yes!! Some of my ultimate favorite books. Every time I read them it’s delightful.
7681,lbb7v4,11,"And The Goose Girl (at least I think that’s what it’s called. An adaptation of a fairy tale, and one I loved when I was younger."
7682,lbb7v4,3,"Beauty by Robin McKinley is one of my favorites in this vein! It’s a really fun take on the Beauty and the Beast, and it’s one of my go-to reads."
7683,lbb7v4,15,"The movie is quite good, though certainly different from the book. It’s critically acclaimed, frankly! Would recommend either"
7684,lbb7v4,3,"Keturah and Lord Death is the only original story I've ever read that really, truly could have been a two hundred year old fairytale. It's prose and heart are so pure and perfect, it's the only book I've ever described as enchanting."
7685,lbb7v4,5,Came here to suggest this
7686,lbb7v4,3,Or anything by Patricia C. Wrede. Dealing with Dragons might by my all-time favorite
7687,lbb7v4,5,"The Inkworld trilogy by Cornelia Funke always felt very fairytale-esque to me and were absolutely fantastic. Start with {{Inkheart}}

Adam Gidwitz has a delightful trilogy (definitely read in order) retelling fairytales with surprising and delightful and dark twists.

{{A Tale Dark and Grimm}}"
7688,lbb7v4,19,"Just finished both of these. They’re great! Would also highly recommend the Winternight Trilogy by Katherine Arden

Edit to confirm Uprooted had a sex scene if OP doesn’t want that. Spinning Silver and Winternight does not have anything explicit."
7689,lbb7v4,3,I second this as well! The Goose Girl is one of my all time favorite books.
7690,lbb7v4,4,"Seraphina by Rachel Hartman 

Summers at Castle Auburn by Sharon Shinn 

East by Edith Pattou 

Beauty by Robin McKinley 

Sisters Red by Jackson Pearce

Hunted by Meagan Spooner 

Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow by Jessica Day George 

Wildwood Dancing by Juliet Marillier

Poisoned by Jennifer Donnelly 

Breadcrumbs by Anne Ursu 

Peter and the Starcatchers by Dave Barry 

Keturah and Lord Death by Martine Leavitt"
7691,lbb7v4,8,"Came here to say this (Beauty), also Deerskin, Rose Daughter and Spindle's End all from the same author. Retelling fairy tales with a more modern perspective is her jam."
7692,lbb7v4,3,"It's better than the movie (and I love the movie) the prose is absolutely gorgeous. There are a lot of elements which were completely cut from the film, particularly information about Lear's upbringing and a whole extra storyline about Schmendrick.

The author (Peter S Beagle) is one of my favourites, he also wrote a love story called A Fine and Private Place, it's about ghosts who meet at the graveyard they're both buried at, it's one of my favourite by him. He also wrote one called Tamsin which is about the mythology and folklore of Dorset, England - I don't recall it having a love story element but it was more about friendship and growing up. The MC is a teenage girl who moves to the UK when her father remarries and it was such a refreshing portrayal of a teenage girl, probably the best I've read from a male author. I loved the regional folklore elements - pooka, the Wild Hunt etc, lots of creatures we don't really see that often in fantasy books."
7693,lbb7v4,3,"The Ordinary Princess by M. M Kaye will always have a very special place in my heart and it fits your description very well.

The others I would recommend have all already been mentioned I think! So many wonderful titles in this thread! (Especially Ella Enchanted and Goose Girl)"
7694,lbb7v4,5,"If you end up enjoying djinn inspired stories, in that vein I would recommend S.A. Chakraborty’s Daevabad trilogy."
7695,lbb7v4,3,The OP asked for no sexual content and as I recall there is some in this book.
7696,lbb7v4,4,"She also has the five hundred kingdoms series, as well as firebird. I love so many of her books"
7697,lbb7v4,5,"I love McKinkey. Chalice, while not a direct fairy tale,  is once if my absolute favorite books. Incest/rape warning for OP on Deerskin, though."
7698,lbb7v4,3,"Her other books Dragon Rider, The Thief Lord, and the Reckless/Mirrorworld series are all also great, especially the last one for a fairy tale fan (it’ll even tie into the Inkworld trilogy with the 4th Inkworld book, which is being written right now!)"
7699,lbb7v4,5,"I have read both novels, and I will say I had no idea the latter may have been based on Howl’s. I read both when I was younger, but Howl’s stuck with me much more through time. To be honest, I haven’t seen the movie either. The book itself was lovely as a stand-alone novel, but I know there are more books in the series that I have not read."
7700,lbck59,4,Jane Eyre
7701,lbck59,5,Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier
7702,lbck59,3,Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton
7703,lbck59,3,Good input
7704,lbfdl2,3,"Saw the movie, was thinking about reading the book after i watched the movie. Heard its better than the movie."
7705,lbfdl2,3,Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey
7706,lbfdl2,4,"'The Lonesome Dove' by Larry McCurtry if you want to read an epic 850 page novel of love and loss and strife...   If you want one of the most intelligent and complicated books you have ever read, check out ""Blood Meridian"" by Cormac McCarthy, 330 pages of intelligent vocabulary, complex metaphors, and challenging allegories... one of the most difficult but enjoyable books I have ever read in the western genre, the vocabulary challenges philosophy books, but the setting is western, and the metaphors are as complicated as Tolkien writing Christian."
7707,lbkvr6,5,"Personally I think Joe Abercrombie's characters owe a lot to Terry Pratchett's, so I'd look at Discworld if you haven't already. They're comic fantasy novels, not afraid to shy away from quite dark themes but never straying into Grimdark territory. The Witches books (Equal Rites \[has some early instalment weirdness\], Wyrd Sisters, Witches Abroad, Lords and Ladies, Maskerade, Carpe Jugulum) or the City Watch books (Guards Guards, Men at Arms, Feet of Clay, Jingo, The Fifth Elephant, Night Watch, Thud! and Snuff) tend to be the best regarded from a character point of view, and the former is centred on women."
7708,lbkvr6,9,If you want great character work without being grimdark I recomend Robin Hobb.
7709,lbkvr6,3,"Robin Hobb is great, and writes characters that you truly become invested in, but just a heads-up... since you mentioned not wanting sexual assault, you might want to skip her Liveship Traders trilogy. Sexual violence is definitely present in that one. From what I can recall, her Farseer Trilogy should be safe, though :)"
7710,lbkvr6,3,"Maybe the Broken Earth trilogy by N.K Jemisin? It's probably not grimdark, but it's close enough that it's hotly debated. It is, however, fantastic.

Or just go completely the other direction and read The House on the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune. It's pretty character driven, but one of the warmest and most charming books I've read."
7711,lbkvr6,5,"Came here just to say this! If you like classic fantasy her Farseer Trilogy is definitely the best place to start, but I also really enjoyed her Liveship Trader series—it reminds me a little of Pirates of the Caribbean, but deeper and more complex. Can’t go wrong with any of her books really."
7712,lbkvr6,3,Sound like you define Grimdark wrong given Abercrombie is considered the like defining book of Grimdark. Not sure where you got the impression it’s a “bufoonishly” done genre
7713,lbkvr6,3,I suggest starting with the city watch books!
7714,lbkvr6,3,If OP wants to avoid sexual assault as a theme I don't think I'd go for Broken Earth.
7715,lbkvr6,3,discworld and lies of locke lamora
7716,lbkvr6,5,Warhammer is less “hyped” and so gets less mention than it probably deserves. Basically every list of Grimdark starts with Abercrombie. It’s the more discussed Grimdark.
7717,lbm93f,18,I have never so badly wanted to recommend Confederacy of Dunces
7718,lbm93f,6,Norwegian wood
7719,lbm93f,5,I was coming here to recc this too. Cosign.
7720,lbm93f,6,The Stranger.
7721,lbm93f,3,"Do mind that the protagonist himself is not witty, deadpan or sarcastic. But the book really has some weird memorable idiots."
7722,lbm93f,4,"*Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine* is about a loner, but she’s 30. The humor depends on how the reader relates to the main character.

*Confederacy of Dunces* hits all the marks. It’s a must-read for many reasons."
7723,lbm93f,3,"This is neither funny nor sarcastic, but an excellent piece just the same"
7724,lbmnai,4,"The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock comes to mind. Definitely a darker-noir read but not overly gory IMO, the writing was extremely straight forward but EXCELLENT for telling the type of story it was. Easily my favorite book I’ve read in the last few years."
7725,lbmnai,7,Any stories by Raymond Carver and maybe Samuel Beckett.
7726,lbmnai,3,Anything by Charles Bukowski
7727,lbohur,67,"Not ghosts, but I personally found  Nick Cutter's ""The Troop"" pretty scary.  Really body horror, and some of the passages felt awful while reading. More paranormally minded would be like Paul Tremblay's ""Head Full of Ghosts"" or ""Cabin at the End of the World"". I personally like the tension of not knowing if its sanity slipping away or actual demons/ghosts."
7728,lbohur,22,"The only book to ever haunt me is ""Hogg"" by Samuel R. Delany. Much scarier than ghosts and all that shit. Real transgression is the ultimate horror.

On a more conventional note, M. R. James did the best traditional ghost stories that still have the power to give the willies to all and sundry."
7729,lbohur,11,"Check out Imaginary Friend by Stephen Chbosky. Ghosts, mumbling zombie types, demons trying to cross over. Spooky and tons of fun to read. Also, u/raisedbyheathens suggestions are awesome."
7730,lbohur,119,The Shining by Stephen King.
7731,lbohur,117,"The Ritual was the scariest book I've read, and I'm into horror. For some reason, it scared me so bad I had to stay up and finish reading, and then I couldn't sleep (and I'm a grown person*tm, it was ridiculous). I read it a while before the movie came out, I imagine if you've seen the movie, the book probably wouldn't be as scary, not sure."
7732,lbohur,12,"I always found It by Stephen King super scary but I did read it at a young age, so I don't know how it holds up.

Also pretty scary: Hex by Thomas Olde Heuvelt. I haven't read it in English yet (he changed the setting to the US in the English version), but I found it pretty nerve-wracking in the original."
7733,lbohur,126,"I've been looking for a scary book too, most books I found so far, while they are thrilling, aren't scary.
The only bokk so far that managed to give me the chills for reals was 'Salem' s lot' by Stephen King. Can really recommend."
7734,lbohur,12,I am not into vampires kind of stuff. More into paranormal.
7735,lbohur,4,This was an amazing book.
7736,lbohur,8,"I like to think that I can handle scary things pretty well, but A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul G. Tremblay really freaked me out."
7737,lbohur,10,"Penpal by Dathan Auerbach

Maybe more thrilling than horror but it definitely messes with your brain!"
7738,lbohur,13,have you read The Shining by King?
7739,lbohur,3,"While not being a horror book, there is a part in 22/11/63 that haunts me to this day."
7740,lbohur,10,I'd recommend The Woman In Black by Susan Hill. A good old fashioned ghost story. I had to sleep with the light on when I finished it.
7741,lbohur,31,"The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty. I didn’t really did the movie too scary, but the book terrified me in ways I can’t describe."
7742,lbohur,7,Dark Matter by Michelle Paver
7743,lbohur,5,"I remember being intrigued by it when I read it on reddit, but there were a ton of plot holes. I figured “oh hey, he wrote a full book, he must have fixed them”. Nope. Still there and still glaring."
7744,lbohur,22,Bag of Bones. It’s a great read and is genuinely scary at points.
7745,lbohur,27,"the ruins by scott smith—it’s about a group of american tourists (who actually aren’t particularly stupid!) who get trapped on top of the ruins of a mayan temple, surrounded by semi-sentient, borderline lovecraftian flesh-eating vines."
7746,lbohur,3,"The shining ,pet sematary , or Salem’s lot"
7747,lbohur,12,"I liked The Troop and Head Full of Ghosts.  Didn't find the Troop terrifying, but I thought it was a good edgy read.  Head Full of Ghosts had more of a creep factor, but I didn't really find it very scary.  The ending was a good one though."
7748,lbohur,26,House of Leaves is in the realm if you haven't read it.
7749,lbohur,7,I just bought Head Full of Ghosts. I'll start it today 😁
7750,lbohur,21,"I remember you by Yrsa Sigurðardóttir. Scariest thing I've read. I've been trying to find something to love up to it ever since. 

I did find Stephen King to be legitimately scary but it's also been years since I read it. 

Hex starts out strong and scary enough it made up for the fact it goes off the rails at the end. 

The Troop was creepy and gross but I didn't find it that scary."
7751,lbohur,14,Yes. I had to put it on pause several times.
7752,lbohur,8,Dean Koontz intensity
7753,lbohur,8,This book scared me so badly that I could only read it in the morning and I still can't watch the movie.
7754,lbohur,23,"The haunting of hill house by Shirley Jackson 
The Shining, It &amp; Pet Sematary by Stephen King"
7755,lbohur,4,No. Is it a good horror? Tho I have heard that the movie was one of the greatest horrors of all time
7756,lbohur,15,I haven’t read it yet but I was like that with IT. Took me a little under a year to read it because I kept needing to take a break 😅
7757,lbohur,20,"If you like psychological horror, Leaves of Grass is great. Its not Lovecraftian, but it made me feel what I imagine it’s like to be a worshipper of Lovecraftian Outer Gods who slowly descends into madness.

Edit: I wrote Leaves of Grass instead of House of Leaves, I had a brain fart y’all xD 

I totally mean the novel by Mark Z. Danielewski"
7758,lbohur,11,I remember the book Phantoms by Dean Koontz reallllly scaring me. I read it as a teenager though so I may not be quite as scared now!
7759,lbohur,11,I had to pause on IT as well! It terrified me.
7760,lbohur,5,Relic by Preston &amp; Child is the scariest book I've ever read.
7761,lbohur,12,"Sun Down Motel was excellent! Also, check out Michael McDowell from the 1980s. The Elementals was my favorite. I, too, love the supernatural books."
7762,lbohur,3,I second this.
7763,lbohur,57,"Heart Shaped Box by Joe Hill. It's kind of just your average ghost story, but it really got to me for some reason."
7764,lbohur,27,The book is much scarier than the movie. It’s the only book that’s ever truly creeped me out.
7765,lbohur,16,Leaves of Grass is by Walt Whitman.  I think you mean House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski
7766,lbohur,3,"the movie was absolute garbage.
It is the only horror book I have read, so I dont have anything to compare to, but I can tell you this: the book was amazing and some parts of it were scary (like really scary, I didn't even know it was a horror book when I picked it up, but I couldn't believe that a written story could make me fear)

Edit: to anyone who thinks the movie was good, if you have also read the books, then its ok I guess; if you haven't, the movie might be good as a standalone, but when compared to the book it's story is garbage. Its like someone read a small summary of the book and made the movie. I don't want to spoil the book, some ideas just cant be conveyed through movie. And king knew what he was doing. Sure some scenes were creepy but the ideas, the ones that can not be conveyed (or rather were not) were the true horror and genius in the book. Skipping over the essential ideas of the book hardly seems to make a good movie especially when compared to the book"
7767,lbohur,3,The Walt Whitman book?
7768,lbohur,16,Ghosts of democracy
7769,lbohur,11,"See, I found this unbearably campy and melodramatic. The characters fell into stereotypical roles and the vines felt like they came out of a Goosebumps book. Nothing about it really seemed to build any tension.

A lot of people seemed to love both this novel and its film adaptation, though, so I might be the odd one out. But as someone who can't handle much horror at all, I was disappointed."
7770,lbohur,3,One of my favourite King books. Which part haunts you?
7771,lbohur,5,"The Road by Cormac McCarthy, not traditionally horror (although there are some scary parts), but the fear you have for the main characters keeps you on edge the whole novel."
7772,lbohur,15,"Pet Semetary by Stephen King. I personally found it to be the scariest of his books, and I’ve read The Shining. Had to pause it several times. Sometimes, dead is better."
7773,lbohur,6,"I read this and it stuck with me for a few days, so Scott Smith did something right here."
7774,lbqzql,28,Alexander McCall Smith’s No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series - it’s cozy and gentle but also pretty bright and funny.  It’s been a good read along for a couple of folks I know.
7775,lbqzql,22,"{{And Then There Were None}} Agatha Christie.

This is really easy to get into and really rewarding as you try to figure out the possible motivations of each character. It's also the best selling crime novel of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

{{The Woman In White}} Wilkie Collins.

Some people find this to be a little bit on the long side. But this classic in my opinion still outshines more modern mysteries.

&amp;#x200B;

{{Rebecca}} Daphne du Maurier.

This one is interesting to read with another person because different people seem to have vastly different opinions on the ""point"" of it. Some read it as a romance, others as a mystery. Some find it romantic and sweet, others not so much."

&gt;First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:
&gt;
&gt;""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""
&gt;
&gt;When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.

[**The Woman in White**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5890.The_Woman_in_White)

^(By: Wilkie Collins, Matthew Sweet | 672 pages | Published: 1859 | Popular Shelves: classics, mystery, fiction, classic, gothic | )[^(Search ""The Woman In White"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The Woman In White&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;'In one moment, every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop... There, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth, stood the figure of a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white'
&gt;
&gt;The Woman in White famously opens with Walter Hartright's eerie encounter on a moonlit London road. Engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie, Walter becomes embroiled in the sinister intrigues of Sir Percival Glyde and his 'charming' friend Count Fosco, who has a taste for white mice, vanilla bonbons, and poison. Pursuing questions of identity and insanity along the paths and corridors of English country houses and the madhouse, The Woman in White is the first and most influential of the Victorian genre that combined Gothic horror with psychological realism.
&gt;
&gt;Matthew Sweet's introduction explores the phenomenon of Victorian 'sensation' fiction, and discusses Wilkie Collins's biographical and societal influences. Included in this edition are appendices on theatrical adaptations of the novel and its serialisation history.

7782,lbqzql,3,"I honestly can't get over how much I loved {{Anxious People}}

It's a mystery but it focuses more on the relationships between people and the struggles that all people can and do go through. It was the last book (of 40ish) I read last year and it was my favorite. So much so that it was my go-to Christmas gift for many friends and family.

It includes both m/f and m/m relationships. It's one of my favorite comfort reads. 

*Hench* by Natalie Zina Walschots. A minion injured by a superhero begins investigating the collateral damage caused by heroes and finds that the difference between heroes and villains, considered mathematically, might be largely one of PR. The MC is bi, and her main love interest is a guy. 

*The Invisible Life of Addie Larue* by VE Schwab features a bi MC who gains immortality at the price of never being remembered by anyone. Both her primary relationships throughout the book are with men (or, well, one man and one male demony thing)."

&gt;It is the fourteenth century and one of the most apocalyptic events in human history is set to occur - the coming of the Black Death. History teaches us that a third of Europe's population was destroyed. But what if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been: a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt.

Here Choctaw traditions are safe from the cultural genocide being waged in the world above. But crisis is about to strike the underground community, threatening its continued existence.

7807,lh76g1,4,Thanks very much!!

7809,lh76g1,9,Let it sit for a moment. I'm on mobile too and just seems to be an animation
7810,lh76g1,5,"That is a pretty cool website, thank you for this. 

I also use [https://www.orderofbooks.com/](https://www.orderofbooks.com/) because some authors can be pretty prolific and sometimes it's hard to figure out what book comes next in a series."
7811,lh76g1,4,I use [https://www.orderofbooks.com/](https://www.orderofbooks.com/) for that. It's a pretty useful site too.
7812,lh76g1,3,"I got this website here on reddit too! I'm still curious on how they based the ""similarity"" like is it based on genre? writing style? hmmm"
7813,lh76g1,3,"As I understand it, it's based on overlap of readers. It doesn't try to analyze the writing at all, it just says, ""People who like author A tend to like author B as well."""
7814,lh76g1,9,"I typed in Vonnegut and it kicked back most of my favorite authors (double English major over here), but not a single woman writer. No Atwood or Le Guin or even Anne Tyler. Where the women at?

Still, quite cool. Pretty accurate suggestions off of Vonnegut, too."
7815,lqehmn,4,"Trudi Canavan's ""The Black Magician"" trilogy is awesome. Got a prequel and a sequel even though I'd recommend to read {{The Black Magician}} first and the prequel later if you want to avoid being spoilered for the main story^^"
7816,lqehmn,3,"Oh and it's not really fantasy but more of a medieval adventure: 
{{The Letter For The King}} by Tonke Dragt

And another one (which is more like young adult fantasy but still kinda focused on politics in those imaginary realms). It's a series written by Kristin Cashore which is about 3 women owning their political positions in their kingdoms. One is an assassin, the other a monster and the last one a young queen trying to figure out how to lead her country.
The books are called {{Graceling}}, {{Fire}} and  {{Bitterblue}}."
7817,lqehmn,3,"Not really fantasy, but The Kingsbridge trilogy by Ken Follet definitely has intrigue and action Shogun by James Clavel also has plenty of it"
7818,lqehmn,3,"That’s quite a list! I haven’t read all of those, but several of these are in my top favorites list. Gentlemen Bastards is one of my all-time favorites for sure, but it’s not finished yet so just be aware that you might be in for a long wait (worth it though, and the books largely stand alone, each one focuses on a different heist or con job that gets wrapped up in some way by the end. There are always a lot of questions left unanswered for future books, but the endings still feel satisfying in some way). Riyria is super fun, I devoured those books haha. The Powder Mage books were ones I couldn’t personally get into, the magic system is really awesome but the characters just weren’t for me (still worth a read though, especially for Sanderson fans!). 

Lightbringer honestly felt like Stormlight Archive and ASOIAF combined (unique magic system with clear, understandable limits! Massive war being fought against an ancient and powerful force! Political battles between corrupt old men and young, idealistic people!), so if that’s something you’re looking for I’d definitely recommend bumping it up the list, but there are so many other great series on your list that it’s hard to say how to prioritize them!"
7819,lqehmn,9,"Here are some newer series that have the potential of having the detailed settings and deep dense world building you're looking for:

*Bone Shard Daughter* is a setting inspired by Asian/Polynesian Islands and there is a political landscape here that is very pronounced. EXCELLENT book with some trippy magic use and cliffhanger chapter endings.  A bit lighter than ASOIAF but no less enjoyable.

*Black Sun* by Rebecca Roanhorse is a thrilling adventure book featuring a multi-cultural inspired dark fantasy world. One of the main characters is a young man who is believed to be a reincarnation of a god.  Again, not as dense, but shows promise as having some deep lore and political intrigue as the series comes along.

*A Memory Called Empire* by Arkady Martine won the Juno award this year and it's well deserved. A political Sci-Fi mystery story with excellent characters and interesting concepts about how memories can exist after death. A great character book that doesn't feel like sci-fi at all. Again, looks like this one could go down some interesting rabbit holes when the next books arrive.

*Gideon The Ninth* is a fantasy/sci fi blend that is a wild setting and has a ""ten little indians"" mystery to it. This one is a much denser read than the others, but I think this series has a satisfyingly unique world with deep lore. The second book especially goes DEEP into the politics and world building.  Third book due in a year.

*The Broken Earth* trilogy was well loved by the Hugo Awards.  Very detailed and interesting settings.

*The Traitor Baru Cormorant* starts a series that is *super* detailed in political landscapes.  Some complain it's almost too textbooky in fact.

*The Poppy War* is a very popular and an epic military fantasy series."

7840,lqj059,81,I picked up Pet Sematary by Stephen King after years of not being able to read a book past the first few pages. I couldn’t put it down and really felt sucked into the story visually.
7841,lqj059,88,"I can’t recommend Brandon Sanderson enough. His writing style is simple and really easy to digest, so the real focus of his books are the plot."
7842,lqj059,19,The Long Walk by Stephen King
7843,lqj059,4,"Try THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS by John Buchan. It’s short, a classic, was arguably the first thriller, and races by at warp speed — the entire plot takes place over 48 hours. It was written in 1901, but is so zippy and unfussy that you’d never know."
7844,lqj059,17,"For a Sanderson virgin and an overall non-fantasy aficionado, which one would you recommend to start?"
7845,lqj059,16,"Uh, START with Blood Meridian?  I can't agree with that.  Start with No Country For Old Men, then read The Road, then Child of God and THEN, if you are still enjoying his work, only then should you tackle Blood Meridian.  Just my opinion."
7846,lqj059,12,Mistborn The Final Empire. It's a good gateway to his magic systems and its a killer trilogy.

7850,lqj059,31,"So I think the best two places to start would either be the Mistborn trilogy or Warbreaker. The first is great; action packed, easy to understand and great characters, but it is a series which can put people who aren’t into fantasy off. Warbreaker is the first Sanderson I read; it’s a stand-alone with a good engaging plot put its real strong points are its characters. That being said it is important to other books in the cosmere as a whole so looking back it might have been better to start elsewhere. Either way both are great, I personally think Mistborn is the better one but Warbreaker is great if you have commitment issues. Take your pick."

{the gunslinger} is the start of the Dark Tower series, and reading those books was a trip. Definitely kept me going, and it was one of those series that HAUNTS you once you finish it, and all throughout, I guess. 

{we are legion (we are Bob)} -we’ll see if the bot can grab that title- by Dennis E. Taylor and its following books are awesome as well, if you’re into sci-fi.

7864,lqj059,39,The Martian
7865,lqj059,22,"Absolutely agree with all of these, especially Naomi Novik. She writes beautifully and I still think about Uprooted frequently even though it's been who knows how long since I've read it."
7866,lqj059,288,"Any book by Michael Crichton. His books are adventure focused, heavily backed up by real science (he has a medical background), they are fast paced racy books, rushing to save the world type, very fun to read."
7867,lqj059,3,Women by Bukowski.
7868,lqj059,15,"Well, seeing as you’re open to this kind of fiction, {Inkheart} by Cornelia Funke. Great writing."
7869,lqj059,3,Seconding everything here
7870,lqj059,7,100% the way you should go. I started with Blood Meridian was my intro to Cormac McCarthy and it was tough on my first read through. I decided to read The Road and No Country for Old Men following. After those two I came back to Blood Meridian and enjoyed it so much more than my first time. All great books though
7871,lqj059,7,1984 by George Orwell if you haven’t read it yet. I didn’t read it till my 20s and I couldn’t put it down once I started reading.
7872,lqj059,6,{The Fifth Season} by NK Jamison!
7873,lqj059,12,Ian McEwan. His descriptive writing takes me to another place every time
7874,lqj059,12,Ruth ware does this for me. I always have to take a break after reading one of her pieces.
7875,lqj059,13,"Fair warning for anyone wanting to read this. While it is amazing, one of my favourites, it deals with very heavy subjects, such as death of loved ones, so please go in expecting to see those things. Other than that though, I cannot agree enough!"
7876,lqj059,21,The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss
7877,lqj059,15,Thiiiis. His voices were insane. Really makes you see everything.
7878,lqj059,16,"The Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. Fast paced, and really immersive in my opinion! Plus there are a bunch of them so they might last a bit, I’ve been reading them all throughout lockdowns!"
7879,lqj059,17,"I was going to recommend sci-fi thrillers and stumbled across this comment. Crichton is the author of a good deal of great thrillers that were adapted into major movies and his work will HOOK you. 

Something similar in style I read recently was Cold Storage by David Koepp. It’s about a strain of cordyceps fungus that evolves to take over practically any life (similar to the popular game The Last of Us) and the response to deal with this threat before the next extinction level event."
7880,lqj059,6,Lord of the Flies. Golding has in incredibly descriptive and allows all the scenes to play out in your head as if you are watching a movie.
7881,lqj059,37,"THIS.

Sphere, Jurassic Park and everything else I loved."
7882,lqj059,9,"It's funny how different opinions can be on a book. For me, the Night Circus was very slow and hard to get into. I never really felt like it grabbed me but it's often recommended here so I think I'm in the minority."
7883,lqj059,3,Mistborn is really fun!
7884,lqj059,8,"The Pillars of the Earth Triology by Ken Follett

The Foundation Series by Isaac Asimov

Dune series by Frank Herbert"
7885,lqj059,10,"If you can get into some old school fantasy, try Anne McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern series. 

I must also mention The Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch. 

Another quick and delightful author is Jasper Fforde."
7886,lqj059,14,"With Stephen King, I find all of his books are excellent and compelling as audiobooks - I enjoy them more as audiobooks than reading them. Though Stephen King himself isn’t the best narrator (he does seem to like to narrate his books)."
7887,lqj059,6,"Amazing world building and definitely had that 'magical' feel to it, especially with the audio book. However the plot wasn't really that great, but I still personally enjoyed it."
7888,lqj059,4,"I often read Stephen King and John Scalzi novels in very abbreviated timespans, although some of King’s work is notoriously long. I also read Jeff Vandermeer’s “Annihilation” in two days, but mostly because it’s pretty short. I also recommend Paul Tremblay for captivating and cinematic writing."
7889,lqj059,9,YES!!!! I’ve read this probably a dozen times now and each time I still find something new. Her writing is like poetry.
7890,lqj059,4,"I should add, Dan Brown? He has a formula for fast paced mystery books, sort of like finding one clue after another to keep you hooked. I would start with Angels and Demons. His work does have a habit of being quite formulaic though so after the 4th book or so you may get bored."
7891,lqj059,5,"I came here to recommend Farewell to Arms! Such a page turner, so vivid and accessible, plus the story is so beautiful. Hemingway is lowkey a simp sometimes."
7892,lqj059,10,David Koepp worked on a number of film adaptations of Crichton novels. It makes sense that he might be considered an heir to Crichton’s style/legacy
7893,lqj059,8,"I feel this way toward Ottessa Moshfegh. Her writing is so compulsively readable, even if you don’t like the stories. 

I think Emily St John Mandel also has this going for her because of her distinctive, literary style. It really worked on me.

For non-fiction, Barbara Ehrenreich has this effect. I read both Nickel &amp; Dimed and Bait &amp; Switch within a week."
7894,lqj059,3,"TIL! This was my first introduction to his work, and while the omniscient POV was a little weird at first it really felt like a Crichton book after the first 1/4."
7895,lqj059,62,Definitely Blake Crouch with his Dark Matter book.
7896,lqj059,9,"Big second for Naomi Novik but especially for LMB! Her writing style is very cinematic and witty. The Chalion books remind me of nothing so much as a fantastical and tightly-written Shakespeare film, and of course the Vorkosigan books are a SF action-adventure saga waiting to happen."
7897,lqj059,8,Which pratchett would you start with?
7898,lqj059,3,"Gonna recommend Joe Abercrombie (start with the *Third Law* trilogy) and Anthony Ryan's Blood Song series. They are definitely what I call a ""cinematic experience"" in reading."
7899,lqj059,3,That just happens to be my favorite one.
7900,lqj059,5,"Dune is descriptive enough and ""cinematic"" if that makes sense. That's my opinion. Try it, it's easy to read although Frank Herbert invented vocabulary and that can be a bit off-putting for some, but I actually like it. Give it a go and see if you like it."
7901,lqj059,3,"I appreciated book four for being a bit of an intermission of the story. Book five was VERY good imo but book three was my favorite overall. My best friend says he likes 4 the best and my fiance said he likes 5, so my own circle seems to appreciate the later books!

I really think it's just personal taste."
7902,lqj059,6,"This fits my current read, “ A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. I don’t believe that there’s ever a perfect book, but, for me, this comes close."
7903,lqj059,7,"Seconding this. I picked up His Majesty's Dragon the other day, even though I don't like alternate history or the Patrick O'Brien-type sea novels. I couldn't put it down."
7904,lqj059,5,I've always wondered if it is worth reading his books if you've seen the movie (specifically Jurassic Park). What do you think?
7905,lqj059,3,It's a very affecting story that one. It really does stick with you.
7906,lqj059,8,"I think Brandon Sanderson achieves this so well. His cosmere universe is a work of art and reading it is like being immersed in a movie. Mario Puzo achieves this too— I forgot I was even reading a book when I was reading The Godfather/ the rest of the series.

Also, if you feel like reading a classic, Gone with the Wind had the same effect for me."
7907,lqj059,3,"I must admit I haven’t read Jurassic Park, it’s a different ball game. From what I gather the film is this wondrous thing, whereas the book is concerned more with the technology and scientific equipment..."
7908,lqj059,16,Agree. Airframe was a lot more gripping than I had expected.
7909,lqj059,49,"The Andromeda strain is a great example. Fast paced, loads of science that puts you right in the scene of the action as if you were another scientist trying to solve the problem."
7910,lqj059,5,Good bot!
7911,lqj059,10,"Robin Hobb

I've been re-reading The Farseer trilogy lately (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin, Assassin's Quest), and holy cow, they are SO good. I'll probably go on to re-read the other sets of series after this, as well."
7912,lqj059,47,I couldn't put down Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and it's not even my typical genre.
7913,lqj059,8,"i normally don't read fantasy. like, at all. i'm a scifi nerd. but a friend of mine kept recommending brandon sanderson for years. eventually he told me to read ""steelheart"", as an introduction to his writing style. it gives all the keys to the way he writes and tells his stories, but in a very compressed way. plus, it's not fantasy. so, well, i read it. i'd say it's not his best book. but it got me hooked, and made me want to actually give his cosmere books a chance. personally, i started with elantris (first cosmere book), it's one of my favorites of his to date, but apparently i'm in the minority (personally don't like warbreaker at all, which seems to be the majority's favorite - warbreaker ties a lot into stormlight later, though). mistborn is fun, but not what i'd say the catalyst of his cosmere series. and stormlight archives is pure awesomeness. honestly, i'd say just go right to the honeypot and start with stormlight, but the books are long and may be a bit daunting to imagine reading so many pages before you're actually into cosmere. maybe a good starting point would even be the novella ""shadows for silence in the forests of hell"", set in cosmere but not really tied to anything (yet); but could potentially open up your appreciation for his style and storytelling method."
7914,lqj059,5,"Lionel Shriver. Her writing is impeccable. Try “We Need to Talk About Kevin” (very dark subject matter, but damn so good) and her recent collection of short stories “Property” (they are all great but my favorite was “The Self-Seeding Sycamore,” truly a showcase of her immense talent)."
7915,lqj059,26,All of Gillian Flynn’s novels are un-put-downable!
7916,lqj059,3,"Don’t know how open you are to New Adult fantasy but Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas had me devouring the series in a way I haven’t in years. The first two aren’t as good but once it finds its feet in the 3rd book you get hooked. They were my definite saviours for lockdown reads, and really great escapism."
7917,lqj059,3,"Kind of off the regular path, but the Akira manga for me was a black hole of sci-fi drama that I obsessed over. Also Stardust by Gaiman is a one or two sitting book."
7918,lqj059,16,The Song of Achilles and Circe by Madeline Miller definitely did this for me.
7919,lqj059,4,"I read Song of Achilles in four days. Does that count?

Or anything by Garcia Marquez"
7920,lqj059,7,"Lots of good suggestions, bookmarking this"
7921,lqj059,4,One of my favorites
7922,lqj059,26,I actually like recursion even more!!
7923,lqj059,3,I second Annihilation. It really draws you into the mystery and does the whole Lovecraft horror thing so well. It sent shivers down my spine.
7924,lqj059,3,"I started with Way of Kings at the very end of last year, and it was good enough for me to go buy all of the cosmere books, and start from the publication beginning. I’m through with Elantris 1 &amp; 2, Mistborn Era 1, White Sands, and well into Mistborn Era 2 now. And I can’t wait to pick up where I left off in Stormlight. He gets stronger in his writing as you get further into it, I think (reference intended :) ) WoK, Elantris, Final Empire, Warbreaker- all good entry points. If you like any of them you might just find yourself reading all of it!"
7925,lqj059,3,"Neil Gaiman always does it for me, also Diana Wynne Jones"
7926,lqj059,11,"Anything and everything Tana French. Beautiful and immersive writing, compelling mysteries... she’s my exception to my no thrillers rule."
7927,lqj059,10,I was gonna mention Ian Reid but you beat me to it! I read I’m thinking of ending things in less than 24 hours
7928,lqj059,5,"A gentleman in Moscow, Amor Towles. Captivating story with a small cast of well developed characters. The writing style is elegant, sophisticated and highly readable. For me the pinnacle of a great novel. As close to flawless as a book comes.

Dark Matter, Blake Crouch. Conceptual novel that grabs you from start til end.

Red rising trilogy. A fast paced, extremely plot driven, scifi novel. I raced through all 3 of them, extremely addictive

Discovery of heaven, Harry Mulisch. One of the great Dutch books, a masterpiece.

Secret history, Donna Tartt. Well known mystery thriller. Although not my go-to genre, I thoroughly enjoyed this and kept me reading.

Perdido Street Station, China Miéville. Brilliant novel, fantastic story, excellent writing

Gormenghast, Mervyne Peake. stylistically a superior novel.

Shantaram, Gregory David Roberts. An escaped convict arrives in Bombay...

Gates of fire, Steven Pressfield. The epic story of the 300 Spartans from the perspective of a slave. 

Hyperion, Dan Simmons. Amazing story, unputdownable scifi"
7929,lqj059,3,"I’ve seen this series recommended a lot, and finally decided to look into it. Holy moly there are TONS of books. It’s so exciting! I hope I enjoy Butcher as much as everyone else."
7930,lqj059,7,donna tartt
7931,lqj059,4,Seconding this!! What a story. “Intelligence and education that hasn’t been tempered by human affection isn’t worth a damn.”
7932,lqj059,20,Recursion was amazing. I tweeted him my appreciation right after I finished it and he “liked” it so I was happy for a few minutes.
7933,lqj059,3,Brandon Sanderson for sure
7934,lqj059,4,"My favourite has to be Prey he really pushes the boundaries (figuratively) of nano technology. Also it has a nice family dynamic that gets your heart in motion, gives you something to root for! The colegial relationships within the book are very meta enthusiastic."
7935,lqj059,4,"Hugh Howey’s Silo series is great. 

I’ve always thought that Irvine Welsh is a little Hunter S. Thompson - that might just be me. 

I read Slade House by David Mitchell in one sitting. I might’ve been too scared to stop. 

Douglas Adams is always fun. 

Anne Rice’s world feels real and is captivating. 

Brave New World by Huxley was one I read in a day. 

Along with many mentioned by previous commenters. I wish I could sit and drink coffee with each you and just listen to you talk about the books you loved."
7936,lqj059,6, This is the way
7937,lqj059,6,I adore small gods. And also the Tiffany Achins sub series which start with the wee free men
7938,lqj059,4,The DaVinci Code did an excellent job of this.
7939,lqj059,7,The shadow of the wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón and all of the sequels
7940,lqj059,6,His best work in my opinion.
7941,lqj059,6,"YES for sure, all are brilliant . The first I read was Sphere and I fell in love"
7942,lqj059,6,Loved that book
7943,lqj059,21,"He might be a more popular name than OP was looking for, but King was my immediate thought as well. I read 11/22/63’s 850 pages in two days because I couldn’t put it down. I canceled Friday night plans and left a Saturday night concert early so I could keep reading."
7944,lqj059,8,After reading PS I bought 11/22/63 because I saw people raving about it but I haven’t started it yet. I definitely will soon.
7945,lqj059,12,"I concur.

I read the 3 wayward pines books in 1 sitting. Also Dark Matter is captivating."
7946,lqj059,14,"Recursion kind fucked up my perception of reality for a brief time. I spent a few days walking around in a fog, like ""this is all a memory because it happened microseconds before my brain processed it!"""
7947,lqj059,4,"My husband and I are reading Jurassic Park together, and we are *loving* it. And we've always loved the movie. It's actually helping to read the book, as well as being hella interesting and exciting still. Def recommend."
7948,lqj059,3,"I’m actually going to recommend Elantris, since it reads as a standalone book, and you’re a newb just looking to get started :). However, The Stormlight Archive is completely incredible. I’ll admit that I really had to hang in there for almost the entire thing—I kept thinking, “OK, but like HOW do all of these people tie together?! Where is this book going?!”—but as the book ended and all of the points starting converging and I could see what he was drawing together, I was like, “Oh my gosh....oh my gosh.....oh my GOSH this is amazing!!”

I recommended it to a friend who’s also big into books, with the same warning, and she experienced the exact same thing: Almost giving up because she couldn’t figure out where it was going, but hanging in there because I warned her she’d probably feel that way, and she had the same reaction by the end and loved it :).

Enjoy getting into fantasy! I’d also recommend the podcast LeVar Burton Reads to hear short stories, especially speculative fiction and fantasy realism, and maybe find new authors to explore :)."
7949,lqj059,8,Upvoting for Sir Pratchett!
7950,lqj059,3,Came here to support Jim Butcher!  Dresden files is absolutely amazing.
7951,lqj059,5,You’re in for a treat. It’s phenomenal.
7952,lqj059,3,There’s not enough Jasper Fforde love around here. ‘Delightful’ is a great word for his works. I’d recommend The Eyre Affair as a good starting point.
7953,lqj059,3,"I absolutely agree Blood Meridian is a standout - it’s an American classic, really. But could I, or would I want to, read it in two days? No way. The prose is too heavy, the subject matter too unrelentingly grim. It’s a damned masterpiece, but not something I would tell someone to take on a long plane flight or to the beach if you know what I mean."
7954,lqj059,3,"I was wondering if someone else would mention this! I couldn't recommend these books more - the most amazing writing, such a gorgeous series. I rarely meet people who have read it where I'm from."
7955,lqj059,5,"Haruki Murakami -  prepare to a slow start with a big payoff in this writer's stories. It well worth it and someone that people either fall instantly in love with or are put off by (due to the weirdness, magical-realism, and intense borderline perverted sexually explicit content in his stories). But this is, without a doubt, one of the absolutely greatest writers of our time, and someone that will be discussed by future generations, the way that we discuss the classics of literature. 

*Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World* \- this is a short read and can serve as an introduction to the weird magical realism in most of Murakami's books. Enjoy. If you do, then you can move on to a lengthier book like *1Q84*. 

*Norwegian Wood* \- A more grounded story, without the magical realism in the other books, but, be warned, there is some intense sexually explicit content that turns off some readers. I put it this way, if the sex scenes in George RR Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* series does not turn you away from an otherwise great story, then this case is no different. Sex is nothing to run away from, but a lot of readers will not cross this line for whatever reason, and the sex scenes painted in Murakami can become too intense for some. TBF, it's in most of his books."
7956,lqj059,8,Airframe was great example of how I always feel like I learn so much from his writing.
7957,lqj059,11,The Bluest Eye by Tony Morrison. The Color Purple by Alice Walker. Bastard out of Carolina by Dorothy Alison. Stones From the River by Ursula Hege. Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Goldwyn. Those are the books that immediately jump to my mind.
7958,lqj059,6,Both books by Erin Morgenstern; Night Circus and thr Starless Sea! I've just finished listening to each of them a second time (not consecutively) and loved them just as much on thr re-listen! Such vivid word imagry!
7959,lqj059,5,"Any of Douglas Adams books, i.e. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series or The Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency Omnibus. 

Two day reads, each (7 total I believe)

And then you'll wanna reread them. So outstandingly fun!"
7960,lqj059,4,"Also, Artemis. Both by Andy Weir"
7961,lqj059,8,"Jurassic Park was much better than the movie. Seeing dinosaurs in the movie helped with the book, though.

I wouldn't say his writing is beautiful, but he's a good storyteller."
7962,lqj059,4,Any book by Kurt Vonnegut
7963,lqj059,7,Loved Sphere
7964,lqj059,5,"Seconding Blake Crouch! I read Recursion in less than a day, it was so captivating."
7965,lqj059,4,"The Luminous Dead is probably the only horror book besides Pet Semitary that made me scared enough to jump at noises in my house. There are some semi-slow moments, but it’s so worth it for the book as a whole."
7966,lqj059,3,"The game of thrones series was a movie in my head. 

Also “The Idiot” by Fyodor Dostoyevsky was a movie in my head."
7967,lqj059,16,Sharp objects was really good too!
7968,lqj059,3,Add to that the Time Machine.
7969,lqj059,4,"&gt;Michael Crichton

I needed some exciting adventure book to listen to while walking in the windy/rainy weather to get my mind off of the weather. Thank you!"
7970,lqj059,3,"dude, Jurassic Park is SUCH a good book. get on that ASAP."
7971,lqj059,5,the Jurassic Park book is seriously amazing and such a quick read/page-turner. I strongly suggest giving that a read before you croak.
7972,lqj059,10,So was Dark Places. She is an amazing writer
7973,lqj059,3,"I sometimes have dreams with plot that leads up to a pivotal moment only to be awakened from sleep by a sound that could be misinterpreted as part of the dream. Like: all hell is breaking loose across the country and finally the demons have arrived at my city. Over the hill, at the edge of my elementary schoolyard, crests the devil’s swollen army, and a chorus of fallen angels lift their gleaming bugles to herald all doom and then a passing train blasts its horn and wakes me up. 
—
Either my dreams can see the future (in so far as what wakes me up) or it’s doing some fantastic gymnastical story telling in those microseconds.   :D"
7974,lqj059,5,Completely agree. The Dublin Murder Squad series of books - read them in order - are wonderful procedural detective novels that take you into the psychology of the police detectives. I had to force myself to read two or three books between each one of these so that I wouldn't burn through the series too quickly.
7975,lqj059,6,"Read the first two tiffany books to my 9 year old and he's hooked. Read Maurice next, and now we're halfway through Mort, which he's loving so far. He really enjoys all the word play Pratchett is known for. +1 to anything Pratchett."
7976,lqj059,3,Guards! Guards!
7977,lqj059,3,"I came here to suggest Annihilation and the entire Southern Reach trilogy, really. I'm a bit of a slow reader but I devoured it."
7978,lqj059,5,"The audiobooks for both of those, but particularly Circe, are magical"
7979,lqj059,3,"Ooooo, I didn't even think about that. I was just gonna keep rereading lol, but I do love love love a beautifully done narration so I'm gonna have check that out, thank you!"
7980,lqj059,3,"Beloved scarred me when I read it in high school, I wish I had read it a little bit later in life honestly"
7981,lqj059,3,"Likewise! Before I knew it, I had finished the entire book lol"
7982,lqkevp,4,"*The Bone Shard Daughter* is a new fantasy series and the first book came out last year.  It's a fantastic setting inspired by Polynesian/Asian culture and has some really cool characters.  I recommend this one because my wife and I read together and had a lot of fun hitting cliffhanger chapter endings and talking about what we thought was going on.  Some really cool plot twists and mysteries in this one, and because it's a brand new series you can look forward to future releases together."
7983,lqkevp,6," [This Is How You Lose the Time War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43352954-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war) by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.

Love letters left in time from two opposing soldiers in a Time War.

* Quick
* SF/Fant
* Romantical
* Standalone"
7984,lqkevp,5,"I'd recommend The Night Circus, by Erin Morgenstern. It really helped me recapture my love of reading after a slump of a few years where I didn't read. Now it's probably my favourite book."
7985,lqkevp,3,"I don't have a suggestion, however, I have found that when I am busy and don't have the time or brain capacity to commit to a heavy novel that a well written book for teens or young adults is perfect."
7986,lqq19z,11,Sophie's World
7987,lqq19z,7,"Bertrand Russell’s A History of Western Philosophy is huge but fairly accessible. A bit outdated now as I don’t think many of the modern favorites are featured, but it was book 3 on a list for university in the way back when."
7988,lqq19z,3,"I know that the following are always recommended here on Reddit: 
- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (stoicism)
- Seneca’s Letters (stoicism)
- Sophie’s World. (General introduction)
- The Myth of Sisyphus. (Absurdism and existentialism)

But it depends which branch of philosophy you’re interested in. For example for ethics, a very easy and comprehensive read is “Justice” by Michael Sandel. He’s a professor so he writes clearly and uses concrete examples to illustrate different ideas. 

If you’re interested in politics, the Social Contract by Rousseau, Locke’s two Treatises of Government, Macchiavelli’s Prince, or some Hobbes are pretty easy reads and all available online for free. 

You can also give the novels of Sartre and Camus a read if you’re interested in Existentialism. 

Candide, by Voltaire is a short satirical utopian novel that has a lot of philosophical wisdom in it.

A favourite of mine which is easy to read is Epicurus. It’s more my kind of thinking than stoicism, you can give it a go to see if you like it or not!

Plato and Aristotle are fairly easy to read but also sometimes deceptively so. And since a good translation is essential to understand well, I’d recommend buying or borrowing a good version with notes (eg. Oxford, Penguin etc) rather than just reading free online versions.

For a history of philosophy, you might want to take a look at Bertrand Russell, the History of Western Philosophy, but it will lack anything post-1945"
7989,lqq19z,3,"I read [this](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1038873.Think?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=VD3hmL8AYl&amp;rank=1) for a first year phil class. Having studied the subject much more since then, I think it holds up pretty well as an introduction. I would peg this as a much less intimidating precursor to something like The History of Western Philosophy."
7990,lqq19z,3,Seconding Sophie’s World - read this as a young girl and enjoyed the storyline tying the philosophical theories together
7991,lqq19z,3,"Im reading Plato's republic, it is very good and easy for beginners"
7992,lr0m1p,3,"Jane Eyre. Teaches one to have a powerful and individualistic mindset.

However, the read is not an easy one. The author is has a broad vocabulary."
7993,lr0m1p,4,"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway

The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien

If you don't want to read about Nazis, I recommend The Flame Alphabet. It's a fictional work where human communication breaks down. First kids' voices start making adults ill, then anyone's voice, then any attempt at communication at all. No one is sure just how or why it happened, and the reader is left to wonder if these are truly the final days of life on Earth."

8002,lrafrt,10,"I never watch horror films or consume the genre (except for the *Magnus Archives* podcast which is a gem) but I really enjoyed Stephen Chbosky's *Imaginary Friend*. It's very long and for me it started as one type of horror and morphed into another, with some good twists. It's got supernatural and religious elements to it (things that wouldn't happen in real life) but it also deals with a lot of real life, normal topics, often through the lens of horror/supernatural stuff. So if you're willing to go for a bit of metaphor and a bit of supernatural, it's worth a go."

&gt;What was it like? Living in that house.
&gt;
&gt;Maggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a nonfiction book called House of Horrors. His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling The Amityville Horror in popularity—and skepticism.
&gt;
&gt;Today, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father’s book. But she also doesn’t believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don’t exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after her father’s death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but warm. People from the past, chronicled in House of Horrors, lurk in the shadows. And locals aren’t thrilled that their small town has been made infamous thanks to Maggie’s father. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself—a place filled with relics from another era that hint at a history of dark deeds. As Maggie experiences strange occurrences straight out of her father’s book, she starts to believe that what he wrote was more fact than fiction.
&gt;
&gt;In the latest thriller from New York Times bestseller Riley Sager, a woman returns to the house made famous by her father’s bestselling horror memoir. Is the place really haunted by evil forces, as her father claimed? Or are there more earthbound—and dangerous—secrets hidden within its walls?

&gt;¿Qué puede hacer una institutriz, sola en un aislado caserón, para proteger a sus dos pupilos del lento acoso de los fantasmas? Nos hallamos ante uno de los mejores argumentos de la literatura moderna. Se ha dicho que encierra un aviso de la presencia del Mal más allá de toda imaginación, una refinadísima historia sobre los inconvenientes de la bondad, una metáfora de la escritura. Tal vez las interpretaciones sean infinitas. La presente traducción, obra del argentino José Bianco, un escritor no por secreto menos necesario, tiene categoría de clásica. «Recuerdo ahora», escribió Jorge Luis Borges, «su admirable versión del más famoso de los cuentos de Henry James. El título es, literalmente, La vuelta de tuerca. Bianco, fiel a la complejidad de su artífice, nos da Otra vuelta de tuerca».

8021,lrafrt,10,The Hunger by Alma Katsu. It’s a reimagining of the true events of the Donner party. It’s basically about the psychological breakdowns and paranoia of the members. Is someone a witch? Is something evil out there? Psychological and creepy.
8022,lrafrt,28,"One of the best things about most Stephen King works is that there’s a *touch* of magic and the supernatural, but the story isn’t centered on such things.  I always recommend *Pet Sematary* although that does have a little more supernatural than it sounds like you would enjoy.

*Gerald’s Game* is a dark and psychological work that leaves you wondering whether things are actually happening or are just imagined.  Having said that, the book does have a rape scene (trigger warning) and would probably be considered “misogynistic” by today’s standards (although it was and is a good depiction of prevailing attitudes of its era)."

8028,lrafrt,5,"Check out the Mothman Prophecies. It's a 'non-fiction' book about a man investigating a series of unusual events around Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

I'd describe myself as skeptical of ghosts and aliens, but this book definitely made me revisit my worldview."

Horror films are in general not as good as other genres (just give imdb a look), but it's usually the cheesiness that people enjoy. However, there really is a big difference between horror films and horror texts, mainly due to the medium. You can scarcely create a jump-scare or develop the soundscape through a book. With that said I'd probably second every Stephen King suggestion on here. He spends a lot of time on building the characters up, so the beginning can be a bit tedious, but the pay-off is usually great."

&gt;Working at the local processing plant, Marcos is in the business of slaughtering humans —though no one calls them that anymore.
&gt;
&gt;His wife has left him, his father is sinking into dementia, and Marcos tries not to think too hard about how he makes a living. After all, it happened so quickly. First, it was reported that an infectious virus has made all animal meat poisonous to humans. Then governments initiated the “Transition.” Now, eating human meat—“special meat”—is legal. Marcos tries to stick to numbers, consignments, processing.
&gt;
&gt;Then one day he’s given a gift: a live specimen of the finest quality. Though he’s aware that any form of personal contact is forbidden on pain of death, little by little he starts to treat her like a human being. And soon, he becomes tortured by what has been lost—and what might still be saved.

8055,lrafrt,4,I really enjoyed Bird Box. It’s significantly scarier and better than the movie on Netflix. Maybe try Mexican Gothic too? It’s about a family and house that are intertwined and the main character goes to check on her cousin.

&gt;Fascinating patient stories and dynamic exercises that help you connect to healing emotions, ease anxiety and depression, and discover your authentic self.
&gt;
&gt;In It's Not Always Depression,  psychotherapist Hilary Jacobs Hendel presents readers with a unique and pragmatic tool she calls The Change Triangle. The Change Triangle is a map--a guide to carry you from a place of disconnection back to your true self. Working the Change Triangle is the step-by-step process at the heart of Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP), a therapeutic method that teaches patients to identify the defenses and inhibitory emotions (shame, anxiety, and guilt) that prevent them from being in touch with their core emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, and excitement). In allowing ourselves to fully experience core emotions, we move toward an openhearted state where we are calm, curious, connected, compassionate, confident, courageous, and clear. Through moving, persuasive stories of working the Change Triangle with her own patients, Hendel teaches us how to apply these principles to our everyday lives.

I have found these characters explorations of these major existential themes very very helpful in my coming to terms with my own depression, anxiety, guilt complex, and existential dread.

Plucky young Jenny Benet, a recently orphaned American girl who was raised on the Wild West frontier and educated at a Boston finishing school, has come to Egypt in company with her uncle Neville Hawthorne, a prominent British archaeologist. They're part of a team investigating the legendary Buried Pyramid, the tomb of the pharaoh Neferankhotep -- who may also have been Moses the Lawgiver.

&amp;#x200B;

But they're not the only ones interested in the site. Another party, led by the opulent and treacherous Lady Audrey Cheshire, is shadowing theirs. Someone who signs himself ""The Sphinx"" has been sending threatening letters -- written entirely in hieroglyphics. In Egypt, an ancient and shadowy organization seems determined to keep the tomb from being discovered.

Hancock is a controversial figure in many ways, and he presents this book — about the true resting place of the lost Ark — as factual. Many, many people take issue with his findings. I personally read it without worry as to its veracity, as it’s just a fun and fascinating book.

He’s written many, many others. *The Message of the Sphinx* is also a lot of fun. 

Again, take his assertions with a grain of salt and read his books as though they’re historical fiction. He’s a very talented writer and his work is genuinely engrossing."

8143,lrn2ot,8,"While t’s not specifically Egypt (it’s on a planet that’s clearly not earth), a series I liked that was inspired by and borrows a lot from Egyptian mythology is N.K.

&gt;SERVANT OF THE BONES is Anne Rice's new electrifying novel, with a hero as mesmerising, seductive and ambivalent as the vampire Lestat. Azriel is a restless Jewish spirit, born almost 2500 years ago in Babylon, who can be called forth by whoever holds and understands the arcane mystery of the casket of golden bones he is tied to. Caught between heaven and earth, Azriel is forced to bear witness to the long and troubled history of Western civilisation, from the household of an ancient Greek philosopher and the deathbed of Alexander the Great, to the Mongolian Steppes and fourteenth century Strasbourg, where Jews were made scapegoats for the Black Death. And finally in the present, he is summoned to witness and avenge a brutal murder on Fifth Avenue. The dead woman is Esther, step-daughter of Gregory Belkin, fanatical messianic leader of a worldwide cult, the Temple of the Mind. Belkin is known to be the son of Holocaust victims, but he has a secret history which binds Azriel's fate to his. SERVANT OF THE BONES is as rich and terrifying, as sensual and violent as any novel by Anne Rice - an enthralling epic which conjures up more than two thousand years of Jewish history and penetrates the unfolding mysteries of evil, redemption, life and death.

8149,lrn2ot,6,"It's a limited genre, right? Maybe we'll see some more suggestions soon."
8150,lrn2ot,3,Anne Rice did a couple of mummy books {The Mummy or Ramses the Damned by Anne Rice} and {Ramses the Damned The Passion of Cleopatra by Anne Rice}
8151,lrn2ot,5,"Not mummy-related per se, but I think you would enjoy reading about Cleopatra - the last Ptolemaic (the Ptolemies were rulers of Greek descent from Alexander ""the Great"") ruler of Egypt. Also, a very underrated historical ruler, who managed two seduce and ally with not one but two powerful Roman rulers, Julius Caesar and then Marc Antony. She was the only Ptolemaic ruler who bothered to learn the native Egyptian language. Before her, the other Ptolemaic rulers spoke Greek and disregarded the native language of the Egyptian people over whom they ruled. That Cleopatra bothered to learn their language should show the kind of person she was. She secured a lot for Egypt by allying herself with the Roman rulers. This is an intriguing history with family murder, sex, war, politics, culture, suicide, more murder, and much more. And, it all happened in real life.

Try *Cleopatra* by Stacy Schiff. I also recommend *Anthony and Cleopatra* by Adrian Goldsworthy and *Cleopatra and Antony* by Diana Preston."
8152,lrn2ot,10,I love them too! They’re so fun.
8153,lrn2ot,5,"Funnily enough, the same year saw the release of Richard Marsh’s “The Beetle,” which is similar to Dracula, but the ancient evil menacing modern Britain is a reanimated mummy.

It was vastly more popular than Dracula, too."
8154,lrn2ot,5,The Jack West Jr. series (Seven Deadly Wonders is first book) by Matthew Reilly and the Nina Wilde/Eddie Chase series (The Hunt for Atlantis is first book) by Andy McDermott.

&gt;To you, perceptive reader, I bequeath my history....Late one night, exploring her father's library, a young woman finds an ancient book and a cache of yellowing letters. The letters are all addressed to ""My dear and unfortunate successor,"" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.
&gt;
&gt;The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.

It sounds interesting! I dig archeology! Thanks!"

Yes!! I was so pissed when Rachel Weisz(idk if that’s right spelling) wasn’t in the 3rd one! I couldn’t watch it the same and they just didn’t have that special chemistry I loved. I was heartbroken. lol"

8185,lrn2ot,7,"Michael Crichton's books hit a similar note using sci-fi instead of fantasy, but mixing pulpy adventure with fun real-world knowledge in the same way... ""Timeline"" involves time travel to the medieval era and IMO, it rocks! Also you might like ""The Club Dumas"" by Arturo Perez Reverte."

8187,lrn2ot,3,I am reading Out of the House of Life by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. No mummies but it's got a lil Anne Rice twist if ya know whaddi mean
8188,lrn2ot,3,"A few recommendations, that could take you in different directions based on your interests. 

For the original pulp novels that inspired movies like the Mummy, you could try King Solomon’s Mines by H. Rider Haggard. There are definitely some dated elements - the book is from the 1800s - but it is still a blast. 

Similarly, A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a rollicking “sword and planet” style pulp adventure with similar themes. 

For graphic novels, any volume of the Tintin comic will fill the bill. Cigars of the Pharaohs is set in Egypt. 

Moving more toward reality, but still quite adventurous, you could try Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East by Scott Anderson. A non-fiction book that covers T.E. Lawrence and several of his contemporaries up to and during WWI in the Middle East. 

Lastly, I actually lived in Egypt for a couple of years and would be remiss not to recommend something by Naguib Mahfouz, the most important modern Egyptian writer and the only writer, writing in Arabic to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature so far. His “Cairo Trilogy,” starting with Palace Walk is decidedly non-adventurous, but is a beautiful family saga set during the revolutionary period that started modern Egypt. 

Hope something here is useful!"
8189,lrn2ot,4,Literally LOL’d. Dozens!
8190,lrn2ot,6,"Sahara the book can be pretty dark. Also, I’ve read Clive Cussler since the actual 80s and sometimes it doesn’t age well. One time I thought the movie was better."
8191,lrn2ot,7,"Second this, I’m a huge Mummy fan and these are very Rick and Eve. Especially the first few books."
8192,lrn2ot,3,"I think you’d love River God by Wilbur Smith. And then the other books in that series such as the Seventh Scroll. 

Really, really good."
8193,lrn2ot,8,Oh my god I forgot about Sahara. My dad had the book on tape and it was his *only* book on tape so we listened to it on many long car rides. Just downloaded on my kindle thanks to you!
8194,lrn2ot,5,That was a lie I just remembered he had Angels and Demons too. I preferred Sahara.
8195,lrn2ot,7,I LOVE them!!!  My sons bought me a signed first edition of Crocodile on the Sandbank for my 50th birthday.
8196,lrn2ot,5,Same! I loved her. I don't think I ever even started the third movie because of that :(. At least we got two really good movies!
8197,lrn2ot,6,"Theres dozens of us! But for serious I love that series. Kinda dropped it a while back and been meaning to pick it up again.

Fun fact, got into it because my freshman English teacher divided us into groups and had us read modern books she thought we'd like. I got book one of Amelia Peabody."
8198,lrn2ot,4,"You’re in luck then 😁check out the Egyptian series written by Wilbur smith, packed full of adventure old gods etc starts with River god"
8199,lrn2ot,3,"Bit left field but I would say the Tintin books hit the spot for this - I know exactly what you mean about the mummy, and I got the same thrill from Tintin. Mystery, intrigue and spooky ancient curses. In particular, I would get The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun. There are dozens though each with different adventures and they’re all fab"
8200,lrn2ot,7,"Yeah, I went through a phase of buying used copies of them from charity stores and some of the older ones have some rather outdated positions.

I remember one book has Pitt pretend to be gay, but it is in a ridiculously over the top ""camp"" way.  It was too painful to continue reading."
8201,lrn2ot,3,"If you’re ok with a slightly older book targeted towards a YA audience, check out {{Mara, Daughter of the Nile}}. It’s a great adventure set in ancient Egypt, complete with double agents, grave robbing, and romance. It’s one of my favourite nostalgia books and I think it holds up pretty well."
8202,lrn2ot,3,"A note on reading Cussler, he writes his ""Dirk Pitt"" protagonist as very misogynistic. *That* aspect of his writing is pretty bad, even for the 70's and 80's. He *should* have known better. 

If you can get past that, then his books can be a pretty fun Indiana Jones style of adventure novel. It doesn't effect the plot and doesn't happen a lot, so I usually skip past it. But there are some passages that I stopped and thought, Jesus Christ dude, WTF?"
8203,lrn2ot,4,"Cussler is a great recommendation for this OP.

Matthew Reilly's Jack West Jr series would also be a good fit.  It starts with *Seven Deadly Wonders*."
8204,lrn2ot,4,"Oh yeah, Cussler has some bad shit in there. The overly misogynistic portrayal of women, particularly when it was still Cussler writing and not a ghost writer is bad. The time Pitt pretended to be gay by being being the most stereotypical lisping, velvet suit wearing flamer is bad. The transgender assassin (which he did twice, I think? And if I remember rightly both times the 'reveal' comes by disrobing the corpse of the crossdressing/trans person to reveal their 'true' gender) is bad. 

 Fun adventure stories but oof. I don't think I could ever recommend his books these days."
8205,lrn2ot,4,"From what I remember, she left the 3rd Mummy project/didn’t sign on due to “disagreements with the script.”  Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know.  I love Rachel, but even her presence wouldn’t have saved that movie.  It was a disaster."
8206,lrn2ot,3,"Your liberty and freedom revolves around some stranger not recommending an airport adventure novel series where the hero disrobes two different corpses in two different novels because he just *has* to know whether they've got tits?

I mean, you do you buddy, but that's one heck of a weird way to judge how free you are."

&gt;
&gt;FRANCE, 1939
&gt;
&gt;In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says good-bye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn’t believe that the Nazis will invade France…but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne’s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.
&gt;
&gt;Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets Gaëtan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can…completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.
&gt;
&gt;With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.

8233,ls5xb9,3,"I'm not sure if this qualifies as literary fiction, but *The Red Tent* by Anita Diamant might be good. It is the retelling of a biblical story from a female perspective. There are aspects related to romantic and marital relationships, but it's definitely not a romance. It is presented as a female oral history. 

*Their Eyes were Watching God* by Zora Neale Hurston is definitely a literary classic from a Black female perspective. Aspects of romance, but fundamentally about what life was like as a Black woman in the late 1800s. Published in 1937. A powerful work."

&gt;In the city of Atlanta, women are dying—at the hands of a killer who signs his work with a single, chilling act of mutilation. Leaving behind enough evidence to fuel a frenzied police hunt, this cunning madman is bringing together dozens of lives, crossing the boundaries of wealth and race. And the people who are chasing him must cross those boundaries too. Among them is Michael Ormewood, a veteran detective whose marriage is hanging by a thread—and whose arrogance and explosive temper are threatening his career. And Angie Polaski, a beautiful vice cop who was once Michael's lover before she became his enemy.
&gt;
&gt;But another player has entered the game: a loser ex-con who has stumbled upon the killer's trail in the most coincidental of ways—someone who may be the key to breaking the case wide open...

&gt;Connor, Risa, and Lev are running for their lives.

&gt;The Second Civil War was fought over reproductive rights. The chilling resolution: Life is inviolable from the moment of conception until age thirteen. Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, parents can have their child ""unwound,"" whereby all of the child's organs are transplanted into different donors, so life doesn't technically end. Connor is too difficult for his parents to control. Risa, a ward of the state, is not enough to be kept alive. And Lev is a tithe, a child conceived and raised to be unwound. Together, they may have a chance to escape and to survive.

I will take a small leap and recommend two that will be on the fringes of your preference, just in case, slightly thriller.....

{A Memory Called Empire} far future, space faring setting, with intrigue, politics and a whole civilization based off humanity with a Mayan-ish vibe. Could not put it down.

{All Systems Red} a novella that has again, space as a setting but intriguing characters and a fun “adventure movie” feel."

[Tami Hoag](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9890.Tami_Hoag)

[Sandra Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6218.Sandra_Brown) \- warning! She started as a bodice ripper writer so avoid any books that have romance on the cover or ""family"" in the name....unless you like that sort of thing.

[Brad Thor](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5088.Brad_Thor)

[The Pendergast](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40552-pendergast) Series by Preston and Child

[Robin Cook](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19697.Robin_Cook) writes medical thrillers, he's an MD who is credited with creating the genre. So if that sounds interesting [Patricia Cornwell](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1025097.Patricia_Cornwell) also has a great series of medical thrillers.

[Nelson DeMille](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1238.Nelson_DeMille)

[Stuart Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3936.Stuart_Woods) writes mysteries that have a bit of humor in them.

[James Lee Burke](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7031.James_Lee_Burke) writes about Dave Robicheaux and his side kick Cletus who has some humdinger sayings. These take place in the bayou of Louisiana and Burke's mastery of words has you feeling the humidity and smelling the smells of south Louisiana. If you're into audiobooks Will Patton narrates these and does a fabulous job. His voice is so perfect for these books."

8321,ls87g9,3,"Not the OP, but I'm on book 28 of the challenge I set myself to read 126 books this year (there was a calculation that led to the number but I can't remember how I got there now) so I might be able to help.

The way I've managed to top 100 the last few years is by making a list of the books I want to read over the year and trying to get ahead of the target amount by reading the shortest ones first. At the current pace (which won't keep up all year), I'd get through something like 150 books, so it gives a little leeway for times when I don't get to read as much as I'd like to. I also have various ebook apps on my phone so I can read whenever I have a spare few minutes and absolutely zero social life due to not long ago having moved to a country where I know no one and that's in COVID lockdown so that helps 

The list of books generally comes from stalking this sub and others and noting down any that sound interesting, or by googling various ""must read"" lists of the year. I'll usually overshoot the target number by a few in case of the rare occasion that something is so bad that I have to put it down. 

What kind of books do you enjoy? There's a pretty good chance I'll be able to rec some things. If it's a book, I'll read it usually so I have a pretty varied list of suggestions"

&gt;In Underland, Robert Macfarlane delivers an epic exploration of the Earth’s underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself. Traveling through the dizzying expanse of geologic time—from prehistoric art in Norwegian sea caves, to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, to a deep-sunk ""hiding place"" where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come—Underland takes us on an extraordinary journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind.

&gt;
&gt;Global in its geography and written with great lyricism, Underland speaks powerfully to our present moment. At once ancient and urgent, this is a book that will change the way you see the world.

&gt;  
&gt;    Figuring
&gt;  
&gt;   explores the complexities of love and the human search for truth and meaning through the interconnected lives of several historical figures across four centuries--beginning with the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, and ending with the marine biologist and author Rachel Carson, who catalyzed the environmental movement. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists--mostly women, mostly queer--whose public contribution has risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience, and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson.
&gt;
&gt;Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures--Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman--and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry, and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement.

8325,ls9xqf,9,"I always recommend {{A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson}} but it really is pretty good and, I think, especially great for people who aren't really into non-fiction.

Bryson is very readable, can make *most* things interesting, and he's laugh-out-loud funny more often than he has any right to be."
8326,ls9xqf,4,"[**A Short History of Nearly Everything**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything)

^(By: Bill Bryson | 544 pages | Published: 2003 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, science, history, nonfiction, owned | )[^(Search ""A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.

8327,ls9xqf,3,"I've seen this books often in audible sales, might be worth getting the audiobook in the next sale

thanks a lot"
8328,ls9xqf,4,"The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman - it’s about the beginning of WWI and she’s a wonderful writer. 

The Glass Castle by Jeanette Walls and Educated by Tara Westover are really interesting memoirs. I’m not sure if they’re educational in the sense that you mean, but they’re really haunting accounts of what it means to have a mentally ill family member/parents. 

Disability Visibility by Alice Wong is a wonderful collection of essays/accounts about living with disabilities. It was mind blowing."
8329,ls9xqf,6,"Loved the sob story. I'm so sorry she has both depression AND testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is a particularly tough break for a girl. 


I loved the book Catastrophe by David Keys. Dry in some areas but it basically makes the argument that a volcanic eruption in 535 shaped our modern society. Super interesting."
8330,ls9xqf,3,"The Botany of Desire, by Michael Pollan is a fun read about plants that humans domesticated, and how they changed us in turn. 

Freakonomics by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt is popular economics with a howaboutthat kind of fun element, like a lot of the books by Malcolm Gladwell.

An older favorite of mine because it reads like a seafaring adventure yarn is Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton.

John McPhee writes a lot about geology, but somehow makes it interesting. The Control of Nature  is my favorite of his.

And I would be remiss to not mention Devil in the White City by Erik Larson. Fascinating book about both America's first serial killer and the 1893 Columbian Expo in Chicago that the killer took advantage of.

All of the authors listed here have written other nonfiction that you might like as well or better than these titles."
8331,lsaqgn,28,"*Washed and Waiting* by Wesley Hill

*Is God anti-gay* by Sam Alberry

I'm trying to think of another book but it's slipping my mind at the moment. I'll update if I think of it."
8332,lsaqgn,42,Sorry but “Is God Ant-Gay” made me laugh. I imagined God struggling to repress his attraction to ants lol.
8333,lsaqgn,126,"Boy Erased by Gerard Conley. It’s the memoir of an American man who grew up in a fundamentalist Christian home. His parents force him to go to a gay conversion camp. He’s able to explain the divide between people who think being queer is wrong and people who don’t. He also explains the impact of this kind of Christian thinking on the individual. It’s very powerful.

I wish you the best. I used to work with a gay man who tried “gay conversion”, married a pastor’s daughter, and worked as a conversion “counselor” himself. He was very successful in his own little church bubble. But, he couldn’t keep living a lie and harming everyone around him. So, he left everything, and started over in a new city. 

He was a very giving, charitable, and loving person. He accepted his sexuality and himself, and lived very happily. He found affirming churches to attend as well. He was very clear that the damage to himself and others that was caused by his conformity to a strict and unyielding theology was far worse than his acceptance of himself and his sexuality."
8334,lsaqgn,8,"Oops, fixed it!"
8335,lsaqgn,9,If you’re on Instagram @heretical_theology just started a series on this
8336,lsaqgn,52,"I don't have great resources handy, but the Episcopal Church is open and affirming to all LGBTQ peeps. You can read about some of our doctrines on episcopalchurch.org. I would also happily answer questions via PM. Praying for you as you reconcile your faith with your sexual orientation. Unlearning conservative Christian values/beliefs is tough work."
8337,lsaqgn,16,"I'm sorry, no that's not good advice. Recognizing your orientation is a fantastic thing and your willingness to explore it safely is even better! Far too many religious people suppress their sexual orientation to the detriment of themselves and others. And too many non-heterosexuals have been repressed throughout history.

Remember, your sexual orientation is a part of who you are. Your religion is a part of what you believe. These are not the same. In Christianity it's believed that we are all made in God's image so you already have nothing to worry about. If he made you then it's all part of his plan. 

As well as this there is nothing in the Bible that specifically says that being gay is wrong. Any unbiased biblical interpretation will tell you this. 

Regarding the above advice...
Finding ""a woman who will love you regardless and be true to her"" is not fair to you or to her. It is setting up a marriage to ultimately fail. Even if you are both on board at the beginning, any children you have don't have a choice in it. How long can you realistically pretend to be happy, ten years? Twenty? Forty? How does it all ultimately end? Divorce? Hatred? How can you marry someone you don't truly love, even if you care about them a great deal. Imagine the life you're stealing from her. 

Understand that Christianity is about love, openness, fairness, turning the other cheek and forgiveness. Anyone who tells you different isn't very Christian. 

Personally, I just try to be a good guy every day."
8338,lsaqgn,32,"As someone who has been down the road you are now traveling, I can first of all say have hope.  You will come to clarity, although it does take time.  In my experience, a book did not help me.  Talking with someone I trusted, like a therapist, did.  And experimenting (as in dating and/or befriending) with both women and men also helped me to discern what I really wanted in life."
8339,lsaqgn,12,"Hey, I wish I had some good resources for you, but I will say that I'm praying for you and for direction. Wherever this ends up going, God still loves you and wants you to be with him"
8340,lsaqgn,11,It's fiction so its not exactly a resource but The Heart's Invisible Furies is one of my favorite books of all time and it's about a gay man living in (obviously very Catholic/homosexuality is a sin) Ireland in the 20th century. It's a beautiful book.
8341,lsaqgn,4,Would you be able to forego a heterosexual life for your faith if you felt you had to?
8342,lsaqgn,17,"24 year old gay catholic here. If you decide to explore your feelings and sexuality and come out the other side realizing you are, in fact, gay, then I’d probably strongly advise against finding “a woman who will love you regardless.”

There’s nothing wrong with being gay. There’s nothing wrong with having sex with men. There’s absolutely nothing wrong about loving a man and being in a relationship with a man.

These things do not run counter to faith. They may run counter to *some* people’s faith, but that’s their shitty, narrow-minded interpretation of a thousands-year-old book, and you should not “find a woman” just to comply with someone else’s idea of faith.

Grappling with your sexuality fucking sucks— especially if you feel trapped in a world where being anything but heterosexual makes you an outsider. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat about it so we can work through the shitty parts of our lives together :)"
8343,lsaqgn,6,You're coming across as kind of a terrible person. Not very Christian at all.
8344,lsaqgn,7,"Just as a heads up, Gay Girl, Good God is definitely NOT affirming. 

It doesn’t speak to navigating the evangelical world as a queer person really, but Unclobber by Colby Martin is a good look at the verses people always point to about homosexuality have been twisted and misinterpreted over the years."
8345,lsaqgn,4,"I already mentioned that sexual orientation is part of who people are and religion is part of what people believe.
There's nothing won't with being a Christian homosexual and it's not a choice.
 Must be boring if your religion is the defining characteristic of your identity.
 Or is heterosexuality the defining characteristic of your identity?
 Or maybe it's your personality and the things you do and say?"
8346,lsaqgn,6,I don’t want to just drop a romance (kinda) novel but “Call Me by Your Name” is a great read dealing with a same sex relationship and religious (Judaism) hints scattered throughout.
8347,lsaqgn,8,You sound like a total douche.
8348,lsaqgn,5,"Cis and straight F here, but LGBTQ+ ally. I'm so sorry you're struggling to reconcile your sexuality with your religion. Remember that the Bible doesn't specifically address being queer, as sexual orientation wasn't really thought of during that time period. Being gay and drastic age relationships were incredibly common among the Romans and Greeks of this time period. Anything against being queer is much more modern.  I hope for the best for you!"
8349,lsaqgn,17,"Shameless by Nadia Bolz Weber, not specific to LGBT (though does include that), more focused on the broadly looking at sex and sexuality being part of being a whole/holy/healthy being."
8350,lsaqgn,15,"I dont have a book but i just want to reasure you that Jesus is love. 

God wouldnt create same sex attraction if it wasnt in his will. I am christian, 25 and a gay female. 

I struggled for years and years because of so called christians abusing me for my natural being. 

Jesus is on the side of love , never on the side of hate."
8351,lsaqgn,5,Such a good book!
8352,lsaqgn,24,"I don't have a book to recommend, but I would recommend finding an LBGTQIA+ friendly church in your area and talking to the pastor/priest/religious leader there.  I also want to say good on you for exploring this and not just deciding that it has to be one or the other.  A close friend of mine was in the same situation as you and felt that he had to reject his sexuality in order to commit to Christianity.  He committed suicide a couple of years ago, and I've always wondered if things could have been different if he had gone in a different direction or talked to the right person."
8353,lsaqgn,6,I am slightly sad you fixed it.  I was having a nice time imagining many different iterations of god leaping about many different iterations of heaven wildly smashing ants.
8354,lsaqgn,4,"I've looked at your profile. Seems like a throwaway account to give relationship advice to the emotionally vulnerable. Is that part of your training as an elementary school English teacher? 

On other comments you've defended transgender people and how they dress. Why should he not be gay if you believe transgendered people can dress how they want. You seem confused.

The only other interest is cryptocurrency. Only 4 interests, we've got a troll here.

I made it further than 7th grade when I graduated with a BA in Philosophy which happened to cover the philosophy of religion, theology, political philosophy,  Asian philosophy, middle Eastern philosophy, 2 rounds of metaphysics and much more. 

How are you finding 7th grade?"
8355,lsaqgn,9,This was what I was going to suggest! Seconding Shameless.
8356,lsaqgn,11,"Bolz-Weber is a (very progressive) Lutheran pastor, so Shameless does address sexuality in the context of Christianity, just in case that wasn’t clear. She also has a great podcast called The Confessional you might be interested in."
8357,lsaqgn,5,"I've read this- authors name is actually Sam Allberry. I would say the author (a pastor with same sex attraction) provides a unique perspective compared to most, though it might not be what some want to hear. He does go into his understanding of biblical texts on the topic, though by now we know there is many ways to interpret the Bible (my church has a different interpretation).

I would recommend it. Short, honest, supportive, uplifting in ways."
8358,lsaqgn,6,Nadia Bolz Weber is fantastic.
8359,lsaqgn,7,"So this may be more heavily academic than you may be looking for, nd I haven't read it yet, but it sounds like the type of thing you are looking for.  
""God and Difference, The Trinity, Sexuality, and the Transformation of Finitude"" by Linn Marie Tonstad. Shes a friend of a friend, and I thought it sounded like an interesting read.

[https://www.routledge.com/God-and-Difference-The-Trinity-Sexuality-and-the-Transformation-of-Finitude/Tonstad/p/book/9781138938038](https://www.routledge.com/God-and-Difference-The-Trinity-Sexuality-and-the-Transformation-of-Finitude/Tonstad/p/book/9781138938038)"
8360,lsaqgn,9,"I don't have any nonfiction recommendations, but I just want you to know that embracing who you are does not mean giving up what you believe.  Any person or group that would make you choose one or the other without your full buy-in may be well-meaning, but doesn't necessarily have your preferred priorities at heart.  It is possible to uphold your faith AND be LGBTQ+, even if many Christians would lead you to feel otherwise.  Whatever direction you take, know that this stranger is thinking of you warmly and with hope for your beautiful future."
8361,lsaqgn,6,"So this might be a bit to young adult for you but ""darius the great is not okay"" is a great book that has a young man who is Muslim dealing with acceptance and hints at dealing with his sexuality, its the first in a trilogy so there is alot more to read if you want. 

I know its not the same situation as yours but its the closest to your situation I could think of and it might be helpful. It certainly helped me."
8362,lsaqgn,4,"No book recommendations, but you might want to ask this question in r/OpenChristian as well."
8363,lsaqgn,39,"I apologize, as you definitely asked for a -book- to read, but I think you’d find some joy in watching Queer Eye’s episode on Pastor Noah. It’s beautiful, and may bring you some happy tears. I hope you all the best x"
8364,lsaqgn,9,I dont know where in the bible people like you get your information but in christianity youre supposed to follow Jesus. He never said anything about that sort of thing.
8365,lsaqgn,5,"Im confused by this comment, especially the bit about student ministers. Are you trying to insult me? or Help me? Im not really sure what youre getting at..."
8366,lsaqgn,29,"Hi OP,
I manage a Christian bookshop and have made finding good, affirming Christian books on this subject an ongoing study. I would really recommend ‘Undivided’ by Vicky Beeching. It is part memoir and covers her experience of coming to terms with her sexuality and then coming out as queer as a prominent figure in the evangelical church. Beeching also has a theology degree and large parts of the book delve into the scriptural arguments FOR unashamedly embracing same sex attraction and LGBTQ+ identities as God given. It is honestly a phenomenal, humble and hugely honest book.

Other good books I’ve come across on this subject include Love Means Love by David Runcorn and The Bible’s Yes to Same Sex Marriage by Mark Achtemeier. Also I’m not sure where you’re based but the Methodist Church in the U.K. (which is very different to the US Methodist Church) is currently publishing a series of blog posts by LGBTQ+ Christians for LGBT history month which you might find helpful https://www.methodist.org.uk/about-us/the-methodist-church/the-inclusive-methodist-church/lgbtplus-history-month/celebrating-lgbtplus-history-month/

Feel free to message me if you’d like anymore book suggestions or just want to chat to someone who understands the faith aspect as well as the queer aspect. Meantime I’ll be praying and hope you find some resources that help you feel peace and the love of God. You are fearfully and wonderfully made exactly as you are."
8367,lsaqgn,8,Thanks for the rec and the encouragement!
8368,lsaqgn,6,"I gotta say, ""Must Be a Christian Thing"" definitely seems like a weird thing to say if not a passing remark on my faith."
8369,lsaqgn,7,Or maybe you could be a little more straightforward? Youre comments are vague and seem unhelpful.
8370,lsaqgn,3,Good luck. Hope everything works out beautifully.
8371,lsaqgn,9,"I think you should blame the downvotes on people who don't like condescension, which is what your statements reek of."
8372,lsaqgn,11,"Hi there, I don’t have any book recs but I’m grateful you asked because I’m a 25 year old bisexual female that’s somewhere in between a Christian and a spiritual person questioning Christianity. I’m gonna check these books out too. 

I went to Regent University, Pat Robertson’s private Christian college, for two years before dropping out because it just wrecked my mental health. I spent my nights wondering around campus praying to God (ever had those deep, cathartic, talk-out-loud-and-cry prayers? I had a lot of those) about why I’m attracted to other girls when everyone is telling me that that’s wrong. I felt very isolated and ashamed. I’m not sure how your faith around the Holy Spirit is, because it varies so widely. But one night I heard from the Spirit, “if you don’t think I love you, you don’t know me.” Then a month later, a pastor/public speaker came and gave a sermon. At the end, he let the Spirit speak through him. There was wild stuff like accurately calling out that someone had a tattoo that didn’t heal. And the he said, “There’s someone here who thinks that the Lord hates them because of their sexual orientation. But He loves you, and He has plans for you, and He has not left you alone. You are meant to be who you are.” This was a very conservative school, so I’m glad he took the risk in saying it! I knew he was talking about me (probably others too). I don’t know if this helps you, but this is my experience and it’s a real comfort to me. I hope it can be for you, too. 

Anyways...I guess I’m just saying you’re not alone, lol."
8373,lsaqgn,6,Figure what out? That you're a pretentious and condescending person? One look at your profile told me enough to say that I shouldn't take your advice lol.
8374,lsaqgn,5,"Hi, I don't really have any advice to give but I just wanted to let you know I will be praying for you on this journey."
8375,lsaqgn,3,"Not a book but a musician. They go by the name Semler for their music and gracebaldridge on instagram. She talked a lot about being a Queer member of the church. 

A Note:

As someone who is currently struggling with there own religious trauma I really hope that you find the peace you are looking for. Please remember that you have so many people who love you even if you have never meet them. I am proud of you not for the person you were yesterday but for the person you are becoming."
8376,lsaqgn,3,Embodied by Preston Sprinkle. He is a father to a son of the Lgbtq community and he is a pastor. Great read
8377,lsaqgn,3,"The two books that spring to mind are *Unclobbered* by Colby Martin and *Unashamed* by Amber Cantorna. They both helped me immensely when I was where you are right now. I'll also second *Shameless* by Nadia Bolz-Weber.

I know how hard it was for me to find an affirming church that advocates for the LGBTQIA+ community, so if you'd like some recommendations feel free to drop me a dm (all the churches I know of have online services for COVID)."
8378,lsaqgn,4,"My first husband was a gay closeted minister in non-accepting denomination. Whatever you do, don’t do that. Good luck! You’ll find your way."
8379,lsaqgn,18,Unitarian Universalists are also very welcoming.
8380,lsaqgn,8,"Those would be great suggestions if he'd asked for books about questioning one's faith.  The fact that he didn't ask that question yet you felt compelled to suggest those books indicate to me that you should zip it Mr or Mrs. Former Super Evangelical.  -signed an agnostic mainline Lutheran who used every once* of his self control to not tell you what he really thinks you should do with your answer.

Edit: ounce not once"
8381,lsaqgn,3,This is not exactly about LGBTQ but I can’t recommend Love Wins by Rob Bell  highly enough to anyone that struggles with who they are and if God Loves them or not. Easy read and if you are an audiobook lover Rob Bell reads it himself well worth it.
8382,lsaqgn,5,"Interesting that you bring up how the internet works.  The way I find that the internet works is that the second someone shows the least bit of vulnerability, vultures, assholes, and false profits selling certainty, show up to feed.  You're absolutely right that the OP can ignore your post.  I think he should and hope that he does.  I, on the other hand, didn't want to ignore you, because I have no problem calling out someone who is trying to influence, when he or she has been called upon to support.  But you are right about one thing...I've spent enough time on a former evangelical tonight (even a super one).  Consider me fucked off and done with the conversation."

Absolutely fascinating if you're interested in the case but you ideally should know some of the background because it is faithfully only from his perspective (and therefore misses some aspects of his last days which are interesting because Raoul wouldn't have known about them). 

I work with serious offenders and the very faithful look into his mindset and his way of thinking at the time of his offences is fascinating, and the way a person can be derailed by paranoia or a sense of persecution."

8476,lsroju,4,"Check out Lawrence Block, he writes a few mystery series from the perspectives of criminals. The Bernie Rhodenbarr books are about a neurotic (funny) burglar in NYC. The Keller books are written from a hitman's perspective. I'd even throw in his Matthew Scudder series, which is about a less-than-ethical NYC police detective. That's a darker series but has an interesting character arc over the years. He started these series in the 70s, which is in and of itself a great throwback to the gritty New York of yesteryear.

8487,lsroju,4,"Arsene Lupin by Maurice Leblanc comes to mind. He's something akin to a Gentleman thief, the stories are set around 1900. I think there's even a ""crossover"" with Sherlock Holmes where both are set against each other. 

What I love about Arsene Lupin is that he's effortlessly smarter than the police trying to catch him. But he's less of a criminal mastermind like Moriarty, set on gaining political power. He's more interested in ""ordinary"" things like jewels, paintings etc. If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes stories, Arsene Lupin might be for you. And if you're fluent in French (which unfortunately I am not), there might be even more stories available. So far I've only been able to find a few translated into English.

It has recently been made into a Netflix series set in modern days as well, though I haven't checked that one out yet."

8491,lsroju,3,I just finished this last week and was disappointed in it. He annoyed me by always saying he would talk about it later. It made no sense since he wanted to be dead in a years time and not draw it out like Ted Bundy. Maybe it was just him toying with them. The book just felt skimmed over things and rushed.

8500,lsroju,3,American Psycho by Brett Easton Ellis is not really a traditional crime book but it’s from the antagonists perspective and there’s murder. More of a psychological thriller but I would recommend it if you haven’t read it.

8502,lsroju,3,Seconding White Tiger. Fascinating read.
8503,lsroju,5,I've got to cancel my Netflix subscription.
8504,lsroju,4,"Even the most ludicrously popular novels don't equate to ""is there anyone left who hasn't read this?"" which is always a resounding yes. There are plenty and this viewpoint isn't ever worth stating regardless - not only is it just not close enough to ever be considered a ""no"" but this also needlessly denigrates anyone who hasn't read the novel yet. 

Crime &amp; Punishment is canonical, it is one of the best novels ever written, it's also over a hundred and fifty years old. Most people who have read it are dead, most of the rest of us are relatively uncommon. It's well-known, there might be fewer and fewer people who don't *know* of it in the literary community, but actually reading it is entirely different."

The best thing you can do is just listen without judgement when they tell you about their symptoms and do your best to accommodate them. Having a judgement free space where they can explore their compulsions in safety works wonders for recovery.

8510,lswuw8,7,"The Little Prince immediately comes to mind, but another great choice are any children’s “beginning readers” rather than picture books. Also, even though they don’t exactly fit your qualifications, many people find religious texts comforting, so a Bible, Koran, Tanakh, etc might make good choices, as well. I know that when I was working at the library, a lot of esl learners seemed to also enjoy magazines because of the photography, cultural immersion, and short articles. Reader’s Digest would be a great one to keep on hand."
8511,lswuw8,5,"A Little Prince and The Book Thief maybe? English isn’t my mother language as well and although I am fluent now, I remember reading these two books and actually enjoying them when I was in the middle school. If possible, staged books might help too. Oxford publications have these series. For starters, stage 1 (it corresponds to A1) books are an excellent guide to read."
8512,lswuw8,6,"Thanks so much!  Oh Lord, I totally meant to mention to ask for photography- I haven't a clue where to start with it but it's obviously a good option- thank you! Magazines are a great thought too, and I can obviously cycle them out to keep them fairly up to date. 

I'll definitely think about religious texts, too. I am and was basically raised atheist so it didn't come to mind but it's an obvious one now that I think about it- just a matter of which ones to carry and what editions to get- wouldn't want to leave anyone out- thank you!"
8513,lswuw8,4,The middle school seal of approval- that's always a good review! I've actually had The Book Thief on my shelf for about a damned decade and haven't got round to reading the thing- I should move it up my list. Perils of being a bookseller and getting stacks of proofs every week I suppose.
8514,lswuw8,5,"This is lovely. I hope you get just as much out of the experience as you are clearly trying to give to your visitors.

There are lots of lists online for ESL book suggestions, but I also wonder if it might be nice to include a couple of books in your guests' native language, if you will have advance notice of their origin. Most countries have a subreddit, so (for example), you could post in r/syria and ask what some of their most beloved, uplifting book recommendations are, and see if you can order them online. I would imagine that their displacement and uncertainty would be soothed a little if they could see that you were interested in honouring their nationality; moreover, when a person is far from home, probably the last thing they want to be doing is learning a new language 24/7 from day one, so the break would surely be welcome.

Also just straightforward coffee-table books would be good to have, like books about nature or the absolutely stunning [Man-Made Wonders of the World](https://www.bookdepository.com/Man-Made-Wonders-World-DK/9781465482525?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1614348170847&amp;sr=1-1) (it's quite an expensive example, I'm afraid, but I'm sure there are similar ones that you could get second-hand for a lot less). It can be very comforting to see what beauty looks like to different people across the world, and how many things unify us rather than divide us. Most people love start by looking up the places they've lived or the places they've visited in the indexes of books like that, but what you *end up with* is a list of brand new places you hope to explore someday. I would call that the definition of optimistic. :)"

8516,lswuw8,7,"I loved The Arrival by Shaun Tan, it’s a graphic novel without any words about an immigrant man leaving his family to go to a new and fantastical land. It’s a really beautifully done book, you’ll have to decide whether the subject matter would be too close to home for your guests or whether it would make them feel understood. The family is reunited at the end and it ends on an uplifting note but there are also sad moments."
8517,lswuw8,4,"Will you be hosting any children? Some great children’s books that have very minimal to no words might be:

The Adventures of Polo by Roger Faller

Most of David Weisner’s collection - ex. Tuesday, Flotsam, Mr. Wuffles, Sector 7

Good Dog, Carl by Alexandra Day

Mo Willems Pigeon or Gerald and Piggie books are also a huge hit with little kids - simple pictures and short sentences in speech bubbles

Also some Dr Seuss is very easy to read and accessible. Things like The Foot Book or Green Eggs and Ham.

Also seconding the Arrival for older kids/adults.

Edit: As an adult, I love looking at David Weisner’s books just for the art and imagination. I also thought Polo was fun and cute to flip through - gives a similar sense of childlike joy and imaginative storytelling."
8518,lswuw8,3,"Any of Shel Silverstein's books! I still have my poetry collections from childhood (A Light in the Attic, Falling Up) and still get a chuckle rereading them. The Giving Tree is also one of my favorites and the message is pretty beautiful."
8519,lswuw8,4,"I would recommend some, like, coffee table books for this.  These are books that are primarily pictures and are meant for adults.  

I don't keep up with coffee table books.  A lot of them are about architecture and style and fashion, which is great, but only having pictures of mansions or models might not be the most inviting.  I know there's a Humans of New York book that would be fun and interesting, generally uplifting.  You could find a photography book of the area you live in or of your country in general.  Or the area your visitor is from.  There are books based on artists or art museums which can be fun.  Maybe pictures of space or the ocean.  

Coffee table books can be expensive, especially if you want a bunch of them.  If your library is open now you can browse a little bit and pick some out, if they're only open for pickup you can call and ask a librarian to pick some out for you.  It's also a great option because you can talk about the library and (again, if it's open) invite the person staying with you to visit the library with you."
8520,lswuw8,10,"Maybe Humans of New York? In case you don't know it, it started with a blog and is a collection of pictures of, well humans of NY and their stories, and they're often very touching, you can have a look at the website [https://www.humansofnewyork.com/](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/)"

&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of Rules of Civility—a transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel
&gt;
&gt;With his breakout debut novel, Rules of Civility, Amor Towles established himself as a master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction, bringing late 1930s Manhattan to life with splendid atmosphere and a flawless command of style. Readers and critics were enchanted; as NPR commented, “Towles writes with grace and verve about the mores and manners of a society on the cusp of radical change.”
&gt;
&gt;A Gentleman in Moscow immerses us in another elegantly drawn era with the story of Count Alexander Rostov. When, in 1922, he is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, the count is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him a doorway into a much larger world of emotional discovery.
&gt;
&gt;Brimming with humour, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavour to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.

8527,lswv0y,6,"I finished listening to A Man Called Ove and it was a great read! I suggest you look further into Backman's works such as Anxious People or Beartown if you loved his writing. If about spiritual journey, I think The Alchemist fits this description."

8529,lswv0y,23,"Oh if you liked a man called Ove for being sucked into the world and the historical anecdotes, there is no better choice to read next than The 100 year old man who climbed out the window and disappeared!! It is also Swedish, also dark-humory, also about a mans long life story. I think about that book a lot."

8532,lswv0y,4,"I would also read the rest of Backmans books! I’m Swedish but I don’t usually enjoy Swedish authors, most are boring contemporary or mystery books that all seem the same, but Backman and Jonas Jonasson are both amazing and really funny!"
8533,lswv0y,6,Seconding the other suggestion of the 100-year-old man who went out his window and disappeared. It's very funny and also it has a lot of flashbacks to his earlier life and some of the things he got up to in history. So he was very well-traveled. Also you might like the first fifteen lives of Harry August which is about a secret society those people who can go back and restart their lives with modern knowledge so they time travel in a way.
8534,lswv0y,5,"If you’re looking for history, try {{Pillars of the Earth}} by Ken Follett.  It’s historical fiction set in medieval England.  It’s a long book but it goes by fast!  It’s a great view into daily life in a different time, and while I wouldn’t exactly call it spiritual, it’s set in a monastery and the characters’ religious beliefs are important to the plot."
8535,lsx04u,3,Universal a guide to the cosmos by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw maybe? I enjoyed it
8536,lsx04u,3,"If you have an audible account, check out the Great Courses. There are a number of fairly short series covering many topics, physics being one of them. It would be a good way to get a better grasp of the basics."
8537,lsx04u,12,Richard Feynman is a really great physicist! He approaches physics from an intuitive mindset rather than just handing you a bunch of quantum formulas. Really helpful if you haven’t taken calculus or higher level math yet. There’s a reason why lots of people suggest you start with him (at least in my experience). Feynman Lectures Vol. 3 or Six Easy Pieces would be great first books 📚 Hope you enjoy physics and good luck on your senior year 💖☺️
8538,lsx04u,5,"This webpage is related to those books and is recomended by the physics department of my university.

[https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/)"
8539,lsx04u,3,"Paul Hewitt's *Conceptual Physics* is pretty good for explaining physics without requiring you to know a lot of math.

If you want a free book, there's Openstax: https://openstax.org/details/books/physics

To continue beyond that level, you will need to have a good command of calculus. (I can suggest math books if you want them.)

For an intro to physics at the university level (physics with calculus), one of the most well-liked textbooks is [Halliday and Resnick's *Fundamentals of Physics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentals_of_Physics). There are many editions of this one, with the more recent ones co-authored by Jearl Walker.

Ramamurti Shankar has an online introductory physics course here: https://oyc.yale.edu/physics. This course uses Wolfson and Pasachoff, *Physics with Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers*, 3rd edition. Shankar also wrote a pair of books (titled *Fundamentals of Physics I* and *II*) based on the lectures from this course.

There are also good-looking physics courses on edX and Coursera but I haven't tried them."
8540,lsx04u,3,"Check out “Physics and Technology for Future Presidents” by Richard A. Muller. He’s a physics professor at Berkeley. The book is written for the lay person and provides a great overall explanation of the various fundamental physics topics that exist and how they influence the world. It’s a great read to gain an overall understanding of and appreciation for physics, and it’s written in an easy to understand format and full of interesting real world examples.

8542,lsxh1c,6,"If you haven’t already I’d give Brandon Sanderson a try. Mistborn: The Final Empire is a great place to start, though others might recommend “The Way of Kings”. Mistborn is a finished trilogy, while The Way of Kings is book 1 of 5/10 with 4/5 complete book 5 should be out in 3 years (almost guaranteed because Sanderson is a machine). Incredible author either way with lots of books."
8543,lsxh1c,10,"Here are some of my favorites:

Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion series' - plural, he wrote a number  of different series based on different incarnations of The Eternal  Champion - was groundbreaking. It introduced the dark antihero to modern  fantasy. I'd suggest starting with {Elric of Melniboné}. 

Barry Longyear's The God Box is the story of a rug merchant who gains a  very strange inheritance that sends him on a trip through time as well  as across the world. His travels are exciting, funny, and in the end  deeply moving. I'd highly recommend it.

Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series, starting with {Swords and Deviltry}, are also classics of the genre.

{Bridge  of Birds} by Barry Hughart is the first of three books in that series,  and it won the World Fantasy Award in 1985. Set in ""an  ancient China  that never was"", it's the story of a young peasant man who's as strong  as an ox, and an ancient sage with a slight flaw in his character. It  draws on Chinese folk tales and  history, as well as a bit of Sherlock  Holmes. It's a mystery with magic, humor,  adventure, and it's simply  mind-blowing.

The Sun Wolf and Starhawk series by Barbara Hambly starts with {The  Ladies of Mandrigyn}. It's sophisticated and gripping fantasy. Strongly  recommended.

Lawrence Watt-Evans' Ethshar series simply kicks ass. His protagonists  are unusual for the genre in that they're actually intelligent and  decent people. They think about their challenges and make plans to deal  with them - and while their plans aren't always perfect, the forethought  generally helps. The series features different kinds of magic, and  begins with {The Misenchanted Sword}. I'd also highly recommend his  first series, {The Lords of Dûs}. 

Steven Brust is quite possibly the best fantasy author currently living.  His Vlad Taltos series is gritty high-fantasy (magical resurrection is  common, though expensive, and psionic communication is almost as common  as cell phones are in our world) crossed with organized crime (the  protagonist starts as an assassin and minor crime boss, a despised human  in an Empire of elves). It starts with {Jhereg}. I've introduced a lot  of friends to that series, and every single one of them has loved it. 

Roger Zelazny's {Lord of Light} won the Hugo award, and is one of the  great classics of the field. Zelazny was one of the most talented and  poetic writers around, and Lord of Light is one of his best works.  Although it's technically science fiction or science fantasy, it feels  like fantasy; on a distant planet in the far future, people who've  modified themselves into the form of Hindu gods struggle over the  question of freedom and technology. The ending always leaves me with a  lump in my throat. 

Steven Brust's {To Reign In Hell} has the honor of being the most  frequently-stolen (i.e. borrowed and never returned) book in my  collection. It's one of his earlier novels, a stand-alone that retells  the Judeo-Christian story of the creation of Heaven, Earth, and Hell  from a very different viewpoint. It's extremely clever, funny, and  imaginative. You'll have to get your own copy, though, because mine  isn't available for borrowing any more. 

{The Incredible Umbrella} and {The Amorous Umbrella} by Marvin Kaye.  There was a collection of all four of the Umbrella novels released as  {The Incredible Umbrella Tetrology}, too. These are light fantasy in  which a professor of literature accidentally buys a mysterious umbrella  in a junk shop which turns out to be magical. It transports him to other  worlds - in his case, worlds of literature and the arts. Those worlds  include those of Gilbert and Sullivan, classic horror, and fairy tales,  among others. They're funny as hell. 

Look up the works of Lord Dunsany.  He was a major early influence on H.  P. Lovecraft; his stories and plays have a fairy-tale quality that's  mesmerizing. And most of his works are now in the public domain, and  available for [free from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/269). 

H.P. Lovecraft had a HUGE influence on modern literature, particularly  horror and fantasy. For some reason most of his works aren't available  on Project Gutenberg yet, but there are legal free copies of his  complete works [available for download](https://arkhamarchivist.com/free-complete-lovecraft-ebook-nook-kindle/) in many formats.

I wouldn't describe his works as **sassy, witty and smartly written,** but whatever, I guess it's opinion"
8546,lsxh1c,4,"The Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde 

Fans of Douglas Adams and P. G. Wodehouse will love visiting Jasper Fforde's Great Britain, circa 1985, when time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously: it’s a bibliophile’s dream. England is a virtual police state where an aunt can get lost (literally) in a Wordsworth poem and forging Byronic verse is a punishable offense. All this is business as usual for Thursday Next, renowned Special Operative in literary detection. But when someone begins kidnapping characters from works of literature and plucks Jane Eyre from the pages of Brontë's novel, Thursday is faced with the challenge of her career."

8554,lt6lqr,3,"Some suggestions for Novellas (these are all sci-fi/fantasy) that are all under 250 pages.

*Silver In The Wood* is book one in a duology about ""The Green Man."" Forest-y fantasy type of adventure.

*All Systems Red* by Martha Wells is the start of the ""murderbot"" series. Most all of the entries here are under 200 pages. Fast paced, funny, adventure stories with excellent lead character.

*To Be Taught, If Fortunate* by Becky Chambers is a beautiful sci-fi story. She's also the author of a very cheerful sci-fi series called Wayfarers which are much longer books but are super easy reads.

*Ring Shout* by P. Djèlí Clark is about three female demon slayers. More of a horror book, but a fun and fast ride. Think Buffy the Vampire Slayer vs the KKK.

*This Is How You Lose the Time War* by Amal El-Mohtar is written like a series of love letters. Very interesting and romantic.

*A Children's Bible* by Lydia Millet is funny and clever. Basically plays out like a biblical allegory but set in modern era. Was well loved on Best Of lists last year.

*Piranesi* by Susanna Clarke is a unique little mystery book where the setting is just as much a character as the MC.

*The Ocean at the End of the Lane* by Neil Gaiman is his newest. Very twee and sweet, reads a lot like his classic Coraline.

*Riot Baby* by Tochi Onyebuchi is very gritty and frantic, but an excellent read. About a girl with powers who can't do anything to help those she loves.

*The House in the Cerulean Sea* by T.J. Klune is a very Tim Burton-esque magic realism book. Very sweet and self aware of it's qwirkyness."

8557,lt6lqr,3,"I’ve been recommending it a lot here and other places but I’m gonna recommend it again. A Deadly Education by Naomi Novik is a really good book. It’s a simple read, but still interesting and has a bit of a cliffhanger ending that makes you look forward to the second book in The Scholomance Series."
8558,lt6lqr,3,"[**The Colour of Magic (Discworld, #1)**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11138378-the-colour-of-magic)

&gt;Somewhere on the frontier between thought and reality exists the Discworld, a parallel time and place which might sound and smell like our own, but which looks completely different. Particularly as it’s carried through space on the back of a giant turtle (sex unknown).
&gt;
&gt;If you’re new to the Discworld don’t worry, you’re not alone . . . Twoflower is the Discworld’s first tourist, he’s exceptionally naive and about to get himself into an array of dangerous and fantastical situations on his travels.
&gt;
&gt;And if that didn’t sound fateful enough, it’s the spectacularly inept wizard, Rincewind who is charged with safely chaperoning Twoflower and his Luggage (a walking suitcase that has half a mind of its own and a homicidal attitude to anything threatening) during his visit.
&gt;
&gt;Safe to say chaos ensues…
&gt;
&gt;The Discworld novels can be read in any order but The Colour of Magic is the first Discworld book. It is also the starting point in the Wizards collection, followed by The Light Fantastic.

Also, {{The Maze Runner by James Dashner}} also became a good movie. 

And, ofc, continuing on this YA trend, I have to recommend {{The Fault in Our Stars by John Green}}"

8626,lwisgj,4,Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi and the movie of course is Goodfellas directed by Scorsese
8627,lwisgj,15,I'll state the obvious.  Princess Bride.  It helped that the author of the book also wrote the screen play.
8628,lwisgj,3,"Highly recommend “Ordinary People.” Amazing book, stellar movie."
8629,lwisgj,6,"Room by Emma Donoghue. The book is told from the child’s point of view, the movie more so the mother’s. They are a good complement to each other."
8630,lwisgj,6,"The Green Mile, and Shawshank Redemption both by Stephen King and no neither is scary"
8631,lwisgj,10,"Holes. It's a great book and a great movie, it was my favorite for a long time, maybe still is! I've read the book 4 or 5 times, and seen the movie at least 8 times. And even if you've watched the film, read the book and do it again."

Bunnicula #1, 'Bunnicula': very good, very accurate title. Involves a bunny who is also a vampire. Chester hasn't yet suffered the downfall of his neurotic tendencies. 10/10 bunny-vampire literature. Co-authored by a husband and wife but the wife died months before publication, a very sad google mid-read. Please don't feed dogs chocolate.

Bunnicula #2, 'Howliday Inn': Atrocious, not even worthy of the Bunnicula title. No Bunnicula??? An outrage. Skimmed it. 

Bunnicula #3, 'The Celery Stalks at Midnight': The author has hit peak pun. Fantastic. A true return to form. Bonus points go to the thump thump thump of that terrible (artichoke) heart.

Bunnicula #4, 'Nighty-Nightmare': Once again, Bunnicula-less. 2/10, did not enjoy.

Bunnicula #5, 'Return to Howliday Inn': &gt;:(

Bunnicula #6, 'Bunnicula Strikes Again!': IS THIS THE END OF BUNNICULA? spoiler, no. But Bunnicula is in this one! Much more fun. Bunnicula searches for his past. Truly a literary classic that will make you ponder the meaning of existence. Started googling the author midway again after reading his bio and seeing that he was now living with his partner, Mark, and found that he remarried a guy in 2011. What a character arc for him.

Bunnicula #7, 'Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow': the new illustrator is terrifying and I can't remember the plot because I'm way too  busy confronting my [sleep paralysis demon brought to life.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/815420007617003550/816488155746271252/Screenshot_20210303-122211_ReadEra.jpg)"

8642,lwjfot,7,"“If you can rec a m/m book that isn’t YA lit I’ll love you forever” - challenge accepted ;)  if you like fantasy, which it looks like you do based on the other books you’ve read, you will love **The Last Sun** by K.D Edwards.  It’s the first book in The Tarot Sequence.  The sequel **The Hanged Man** is equally awesome and he’s editing the third book in the series right now - it’ll be out this year!!"

&gt;I was ten years old when my parents were killed by pirates. This did not bother me as much as you might think - I hardly knew my parents.
&gt;
&gt;Bronte Mettlestone's parents ran away to have adventures when she was a baby, leaving her to be raised by her Aunt Isabelle and the Butler. She's had a perfectly pleasant childhood of afternoon teas and riding lessons - and no adventures, thank you very much. 
&gt;
&gt;But Bronte's parents have left extremely detailed (and bossy) instructions for Bronte in their will. The instructions must be followed to the letter, or disaster will befall Bronte's home. She is to travel the kingdoms and empires, perfectly alone, delivering special gifts to her ten other aunts. There is a farmer aunt who owns an orange orchard and a veterinarian aunt who specialises in dragon care, a pair of aunts who captain a cruise ship together and a former rockstar aunt who is now the reigning monarch of a small kingdom. 
&gt;
&gt;Now, armed with only her parents' instructions, a chest full of strange gifts and her own strong will, Bronte must journey forth to face dragons, Chief Detectives and pirates - and the gathering suspicion that there might be something more to her extremely inconvenient quest than meets the eye...
&gt;
&gt;From the award-winning Jaclyn Moriarty comes a fantastic tale of high intrigue, grand adventure and an abundance of aunts.

Forced into Fairyland to seek her kidnapped brother, Tiffany allies herself with the Chalk's local Nac Mac Feegle - aka the Wee Free Men - a clan of sheep-stealing, sword-wielding, six-inch-high blue men who are as fierce as they are funny. Together they battle through an eerie and ever-shifting landscape, fighting brutal flying fairies, dream-spinning dromes, and grimhounds - black dogs with eyes of fire and teeth of razors - before ultimately confronting the Queen of the Elves, absolute ruler of a world in which reality intertwines with nightmare. And in the final showdown, Tiffany must face her cruel power alone...

8656,lwjfot,3,"Have you checked out the Hundred Thousand Kingdoms Trilogy (Inheritance Trilogy) by N. K. Jemisin?  Magical, erotic, and a hell of a page-turner for me.  I don't think I've ever read anything so fast in my life; finished the whole trilogy in a single week"
8657,lwjfot,3,"I know you said you have DNF historical fiction so maybe you have tried this one but have you read {{The Magpie Lord}} ? 

If you are ok with urban fantasy and don’t mind series, one of the best smut I’ve read is the {{Black Dagger Brotherhood}}. I enjoyed the world building and the characters. It does have m/m content and a book dedicated to the couple (love at last). As a side note, there are two male characters that should have ended up together but did not and interestingly someone wrote the best fan fic I’ve encountered that makes it happen!"
8658,lwjfot,3,"Inspired by this comment, I'm going to turn the premise of 'greedy gay dragon' into an award-winning fantasy trilogy. I'll make sure to mention you in my melancholy but vague author's note where I state how much of a tragedy it is that I've forgotten who initially inspired my great success."
8659,lwjfot,3,"I love urban fantasy! In theory, anyway. In practice, I've found less that have appealed to me, but I will faithfully continue searching. I'll try both of these out, thank you! Even when I DNF a genre a lot, I try to still keep testing books within that genre, to make sure I'm not just rejecting books out of hand."
8660,lwjfot,3,I love you both
8661,lwjfot,3,"I saw A Tale of Two Cities on that list - LOVE that book! The crying afterwards, not so much haha. I read Les Miserables for the first time this year and it’s excellent. I am partial though because I enjoy any story about revolutionary France (any of their 18/19th century Revolutions will do). My favorite is *A Place of Greater Safety* by Hilary Mantel but it’s long and follows a ton of revolutionary figures so it’s not for everyone. 

I read *Shadow and Bone*, *Siege and Storm*, and *Ruin and Rising* this past weekend (all by Leigh Bardugo) and they were easy, entertaining reads. 

I’ll be curious to see what you decide to read!"
8662,lwjfot,3,"Just to add, the Goodreads bot interpreted History of Sex wrong, it should be Michael Foucault's History of Sex, I've not read the book it suggested, so I don't have any recommendation for it."
8663,lwjfot,3,"Okay but I have to admit, I have no idea what's happening in A Tale of Two Cities and it may be because I am a fool. I'm digging the Dickens still though, no one ever told me that he's *funny*.

I bought an absolutely beautiful copy of Les Miserables to enjoy and I just haven't brought myself to start it yet. I might make it my 100th book for the year, whenever I hit that. I'm still mulling over which I'll pick for my 69th (though I'm leaning towards Maurice), I'll let you know!"
8664,lwjfot,5,"Oh lord, I cannot do any more Foucault. Amazing rec, but I just finished a 4-year Criminology undergrad - if I read more Foucault, I'll die. If I read the one it recced instead, I'll let you know what I think!"
8665,lwjfot,3,"A Tale of Two Cities starts out a little slow and can definitely be confusing as it sets up the story but the payoff is OMG! The most bittersweet ending of any book I’ve ever read. Maurice is a good call. I was going to suggest *The 120 Days of Sodom* or *Justine* to keep with your theme but really, don’t read those haha :)"
8666,lwjfot,4,"I've not read Red, White, and Royal Blue yet (it's on my TBR though) but I have read Boyfriend Material by Alexis Hall which I've seen a few people say is a good one to read if you enjoyed RW&amp;RB. It's New Adult Romance rather than Young Adult, M/M romance, enemies to lovers trope, and there's also some steam."
8667,lwjfot,3,I came here just to recommend this as well. This book is really wonderful.
8668,lwk9dv,30,"If you have not already, Brave New World is another fantastic read that deals with using language as a form of oppression."
8669,lwk9dv,13,We by Yevgeny Zamyatin
8670,lwk9dv,29,"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury feels more relevant today than ever, mainly by showing how *destruction* of language and anti-intellectualism is a method of control. A nice touch is that both books predicted a small facet of the future: where 1984 predicted the modern state of constant lack of privacy with two way televisions (I feel like, anyway), the parlor wall of televisions in Fahrenheit 451 showed the idea of multiple screens in the house at once being a constant distraction."
8671,lwk9dv,14,"If you're looking for something more modern, I would recommend 'The Memory Police' by  Yōko Ogawa, lots of people (myself included) it see as it as a nice 'sequel' to 1984."
8672,lwk9dv,6,"If you're up for an epic post apocalyptic that bends into sci fi, check out Neil Stephenson's Anathem.  As for a pure language based post apocalyptic, check out Riddley Walker by Russell Hoban.  It's an uphill read at the start, but it's an incredible read.  Each book is one of  my all time favourites!"
8673,lwk9dv,5,The parlor wall in this book was such a wild and interesting concept to me given the time the book was written
8674,lwk9dv,3,"At the time I first read it (4th grade- I’m autistic and was a bit of a precocious kid!), my mind was blown by that. With how big and pervasive smart TVs are getting now (and I’m part of that, since I own a 55” one), parlor walls seem very plausible."
8675,lwk9dv,4,"**The Handmaid's Tale** by Margaret Atwood: The United States is taken over by an extremely repressive radical religious sect. Control and manipulation of language is a central theme. Women are forbidden from reading and writing under threat of maiming.  Horrifying things are given catchy names in an attempt to lessen their evil.

**The Language of the Third Reich** by Victor Klemper: A fascinating non-fiction book about Nazi-Germany survivor Klemperer's conviction that the language of the Third Reich helped to create its culture. As he writes: ""It isn't only Nazi actions  that have to vanish, but also the Nazi cast of mind, the typical Nazi way of thinking, and its breeding ground: the language of Nazism."""

8687,lwmpwe,6,I second this
8688,lwmpwe,15,"I am currently reading The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune (recommended by many people on this sub). I swear it has little to no drama. Its super heartwarming because it has kids (but had magical powers), amazing character development from the main lead, and lastly, here is what the author has said about the book: 

""THE HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA is, at its core, a story about kindness. When I sat down to write the book toward the end of 2017/beginning of 2018, the world was in a weirdly dark place. I wanted to find a way to counteract that the best way I knew how: by writing. Little did I know that by the time the book was released in March of 2020, the world would take a turn for the worse. The novel came out right at the beginning of the pandemic, and for a time, I worried it was going to get lost in all the bluster and noise. But the more I’ve thought about it, and the more I’ve heard from readers who’ve taken an adventure to this mysterious island, the more I believe this book came out exactly when it was supposed to. The message of kindness and speaking up for those who can’t speak for themselves is one I think we all need to be reminded of. I know I need that reminder. THE HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA has been described many times as a hug in the form of a book, and I can’t think of a better description. We could all use a hug every now and then."""
8689,lwmpwe,6,Yes! My heart burst reading this!!
8690,lwmpwe,5,"*Anne of Green Gables* by LM Montgomery is my go to to lift me out when I feel like I'm sinking.  It a sunshiny summer day for the heart.  

*Good Omens* by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimon also works, in a get me out of my head way,   with outrageous humor and wit.

And, to be the third or fourth to say it, *The House in the Cerulean Sea* by TJ Klune is like a hug in book form.  It pulled me out of what I am calling the ""2020 pandemic blues""."
8691,lwmpwe,3,"I listened to it in 2018, when I suffered a breakup in a 6-year long relationship. I was also overworked and hopeless about the future. This had slowly, over a course of one month turned into a full-blown anxiety problem and insomnia. I also did not have a single friend back then. So one night I decided that instead of doing what I should do to make myself feel better or to reach my own expectations of 'recovery' from myself, I decided to let myself do what I liked even though it might seem useless, pointless or just a waste of precious time. So I shuffled through the available audiobooks and just like that cuz it seemed like a cool and breezy story, played it. In the next three days, I could feel my days were easier to get by. I was more with myself. I looked forward to nighttime instead of dreading it. This book eased me into rekindling my love for books. I went on to listen till the 4th book in this series, after which I read Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse.   
God bless writers!"

&gt;
&gt;But now, Gaius Sextus, First Lord of Alera, grows old and lacks an heir. Ambitious High Lords plot and maneuver to place their Houses in positions of power, and a war of succession looms on the horizon.

Yet as the Alerans' most savage enemy - the Marat - return to the Valley, he will discover that his destiny is much greater than he could ever imagine. 
&gt;
&gt;Caught in a storm of deadly wind furies, Tavi saves the life of a runaway slave named Amara. But she is actually a spy for Gaius Sextus, sent to the Valley to gather intelligence on traitors to the Crown, who may be in league with the barbaric Marat horde. And when the Valley erupts in chaos - when rebels war with loyalists and furies clash with furies - Amara will find Tavi's courage and resourcefulness to be a power greater than any fury - one that could turn the tides of war.

8723,lws9zo,5,"This probably come up a lot but try {{Mistborn}}. I'm a big Avatar fan and when I read Mistborn I can't help but think of Avatar. It's about a group of (mostly) young people who try to overthrow an empire and its god-like ruler. They possess a power called Allomancy which allows them to consume certain metals in order to gain powers like pushing/pulling metal objects, influence emotions, heightened senses. Most can access only one power but a few of them who are called Mistborn can use all of the metallic arts (like the Avatar ;) )."
8724,lws9zo,3,I just read these and they are very good. They have a great sense of humor and Kyoshi is very relatable.
8725,lwt1gt,102,"I love this sub too, so many people who really know what they're talking about and have great suggestions"
8726,lwt1gt,39,"Perdita Weeks' narration is incredible, I recommend it to everyone, even if they don't like audiobooks.  She's the new Higgins on Magnum PI, which means eventually I'm going to have to give that show a shot, but damn if I have a hard time accepting a Magnum reboot.  Without a mustache, no less. 

Song of Achilles would have been better if I didn't listen to Circe first.  If you want to listen to it, wait at least a year so you won't be comparing it so directly to Circe.  It is similar to Circe in some ways that I didn't feel are appropriate, which is sort of resolved by the ending, but it is a very good candle while Circe is the Sun.

I love this sub too, along with r/audiobooks and r/fantasy .  I've found so much stuff I would have ignored, like Circe."
8727,lwt1gt,13,"If you want another truly infectious narration, check out Moira Quirk reading Gideon the Ninth.  I was tempted to listen to Circe again immediately, but I didn't.   I did listen to Gideon twice in a row."
8728,lwt1gt,3,"I was so in love with the audio book that when I went to reread a hard copy I just couldn’t do it!! Soooo perfect for her voice. 

Song of Achilles has a great reader too, but it didn’t transfix me like Circe did!"
8729,lwt1gt,9,Totally agree to wait between readings!! I was so eager for more then I got Song of Achilles pretty much right away and while it’s a beautiful book in its own right... I don’t think it stood up as well to Circe as I hoped it would.  I wish I would have given it more time.
8730,lwt1gt,26,"Song of Achilles is the beeeest, please read it!!"
8731,lwt1gt,7,"This sub is amazing for sure I dont even read about what the books are about I just look at a recommendation and dive right into it.  


OP - Re: Circe, I have 0 understanding of Greek Mythology is that required for this read? I assume not but always worth a shot to ask."
8732,lwt1gt,5,I listened to Song of Achilles first and thought it was just ok. I think I just didn’t like the narrator though. Then a couple weeks later Circe was available from my library and I almost didn’t listen but I gave it a shot.  I loved it so much and Perdita Weeks is probably my new favorite narrator.  These books aren’t at all in my usual genre of books I listen to but I’m glad I read Circe.
8733,lwt1gt,13,"I think you don't need any background, the book explains every necessary details about the relationship between the characters :)"
8734,lwt1gt,3,"Wait a year, then listen to Song of Achilles, I think you'll like it."
8735,lwt1gt,4,"No I don’t think so. Only thing is that the first chapter took me a bit to get into to. I also did the audiobook so I think it was harder to follow the story right out of the gate because of it

But once you are in the world is explained and you can follow no issues. I would say the only advantage is that if you are familiar with it, the author weaves many of the key figures into the story so is nice when they show up."
8736,lwt1gt,11,"I think I’m in the minority but I enjoyed the Song of Achilles more. I guess the story of Achilles is more known but still following Achilles and Patroclus since childhood and seeing their relationship evolve and the tragedy of it all was just beautiful. I liked doing it back to back as I was already immersed in the Greek mythology world so it allow me to be in it for a bit longer.  

I also did the audiobook for Circe and yes it was amazing! I feel like the reading added so much more to the story. But still there was something about the ups and down in the story that made me not love love love it."
8737,lwt1gt,3,"Me too!!! I just finished the Song of Achilles yesterday and while I enjoyed Circe, I love this one so much more!!! I put off reading it for so long because I was like meh not feeling reading about a hero but I'm so glad I finally read it! I wasn't really familiar with Achilles' story and after first hearing about Patroclus in the Hades game I really really loved getting to hear this story starting from their childhood. It was so beautiful and so tragic."
8738,lwt1gt,3,Thank you for sharing.  I was looking for a title for my credit this month and I am downloading this.  I listened to the sample and was sold immediately.  Not my genre normally but am super excited.
8739,lwt1gt,6,"I read SOA but I haven’t started Circe. Thanks to you, I’ll probably try the audiobook. I highly recommend SOA. I used to pat my son’s back while he fell asleep and during this time I would read by his little night light. SOA drew me in so deeply that I stayed by that little night light long after he fell asleep. I could have gone to my room with better lighting but I just couldn’t get up and leave the story for a minute."
8740,lwt1gt,3,""" - I thought: I cannot bear this world a moment longer.

  \+ Then, child, make another."""
8741,lwt1gt,4,"Song of Achilles is SO GOOD, please give it a chance lol"
8742,lwt1gt,25,Mixed reviews? I've only heard people praise the song of achilles (and rightly so) :)
8743,lwt1gt,11,"To add my voice to the (Greek) choir: 

I ***LOVE, LOVE, LOVE*** *Circe.*

I very much like *Song of Achilles.* It's only a come-down in the sense that *Achilles* was absolutely one of my favorite books the year I read it VS. *Circe* being in my desert-island, all-time Top 5.

Especially if you're at all a mythology/fables geek, you should read it,  plus it's interesting to spend some time with the character Odysseus before he ends up on Circe's island.

(Warning: *Circe* didn't make me cry, but *Achilles* did!)"
8744,lwt1gt,3,"I have the book, but haven’t gotten to it yet. I’m now sold on the audiobook for this one. That’ll be my monthly Audible credit, and I’ll listen right after I finish Girl, Woman, Other."
8745,lwt1gt,3,"Gideon is *so* good, although I read it (don't really do audiobooks)."
8746,lwt1gt,7,I’m literally listening to this audiobook now based on this sub suggestion of the book! Couldn’t place the narrators voice - turns out she’s the British girl in the horror movie As Above So Below which was a wild realization
8747,lwt1gt,3,"I wasn't into audiobooks, and I was actually against them entirely, but getting into them has been so awesome.  It took some time to get used to it, but there are some performances that elevate a book so much, and this is one of them.  Not every narration is amazing, but many are good and some are the audio equivalent of the best thing you ever ate that you spend the rest of your life wishing you could eat it every day.  Gideon was one of those.

On top of the wonderful experience listening is, it is also convenient.  Between the convenience of being able to listen to a book while doing other things, and the availability of them in the library apps, I've listened to more books in the last two years than I read in the 10-20 before, and I love reading."
8748,lwt1gt,3,"I really like Circe and A Song of Achilles equally. I’m not sure why ASOA is getting such mixed reviews, I greatly enjoyed them both!"
8749,lwt1gt,3,"Oh yeah, not dissing audiobooks at all, I listen to them on road trips and such along with podcasts. But who does road trips right now. :-P Most other times I prefer to read myself, because I'm an imaginative reader (and I read faster than the average audiobook narrator does or should) and I don't really process as well via listening."
8750,lwt1gt,3,"I read Circe rather than listened to it, so I can’t compare audiobooks. However, I am listening to The Song of Achilles currently and it’s really drawing me in. Only about 2 hours in so far but I just know I’m in for a rough ride because of this sub."
8751,lwt1gt,9,"I'm someone who wasn't blown away by Song of Achilles. I'm not into romances, anyway, so this might not have been the book for me. What I like about this sub is that I try a lot of different books, even if I might not like them as much as others."
8752,lwt1gt,3,Oh fuck I absolutely fucking **LOVE** that movie. Maybe I’ll get the audio book just for this reason lol
8753,lwt1gt,3,"I'm listening to Song of Achilles right now, after reading so many suggestions about it here. It's much better and more surprising than I expected! So I'll be listening to Circe as well anytime soon."
8754,lwt1gt,3,Circe is by the same author right? Is it another romance/tragedy or no. I actually am not well read on greek myth.
8755,lwt1gt,3,Those of you who love Circe should read A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes. Can’t speak for the audiobook mind you
8756,lwt1gt,6,"Oh yes, same author (she wrote *Achilles* first).

*Circe* definitely has both romance and tragedy in it along with adventure and fantasy;  it's not a ""romantic tragedy"" in the same way *Achilles* is. It's really more an epic story of one woman (/goddess) over the course of centuries of her life.

For those who happen to be fans of Greek myth and/or The Odyssey, it takes a pretty minor character and turns her into the narrator and hero, and likewise these major gods and heroes become players in *her* story- but it's not necessary to be familiar with them to enjoy it, just a fun bonus if you are."
8757,lwt1gt,4,Well cool I'll add it to my list because Achilles stuck with me so if Circe is as good or better it will be a great read.
8758,lwt1gt,4,"I loved Song of Achilles, and I read it shortly after I read Circe. I still ponder the story of Achilles, and don’t think much about Circe. Madeline Miller did an interview I watched online, and in it she recommends more reading. I’m currently working my way through her reading list. She’s a great writer!"
8759,lwt1gt,7,This☝️
8760,lwt1gt,3,"Since you've read both...

I listened to them, and the performance for Circe is truly special.  Very few performances can match it.  The problem I had with Achilles is that the narration is very similar in tone, which is to say passive and melancholy, &gt;! which I didn't think made sense until the end, when you learn that Patroclus' ghost is telling the story, he's already dead.  Until that point, or the point where I suspected he wasn't making it out of the Trojan War, it didn't make sense to me that a human would be so drowsy telling such a personal story.  With Circe, she's a thousands years old demigoddess, so a little detachment from things that happened so long ago makes sense. !&lt;

&gt;!So, ultimately, it did justify the style of narration in Achilles, but by that point I spent too much time irked by it.  Also, humans with one tragic lifetime aren't as interesting as everything Circe portrayed.  I love mythology more for gods than heroes.!&lt;"
8761,lwt1gt,3,"I just got Circe and am so excited to start it, especially after seeing this! I actually have read Song of Achilles and I highly recommend. In fact, that’s what encouraged me to buy Circe. I think Madeline Miller is just awesome. Song of Achilles is such a great story of  love and friendship, and it takes a perspective that is very rare, but so impactful!"
8762,lwt1gt,3,We’ve ordered it for my sons birthday 🥳
8763,lwtv7m,6,"Oh, man. Jump right into {{Cat's Cradle}} if you can. Maybe more relevant in 2021 than it was in the '60s."
8764,lwtv7m,3,"You should really just read the rest of his books. As another said, Cat's Cradle is great, Galapagos, Slaughterhouse 5. He continues his commentary on the absurdity of life and culture as a common theme throughout his writings."
8765,lwy0zj,4,"It's going to sound crazy, but ""romance"" books with toxics relationship tell me everything that shouldn't happen in a relationship, the problem is I hate reading those books."
8766,lwy0zj,9,"I don't like the religious aspect of it, but *The 5 Love Languages* was really helpful, as it showed that my partner and I want to receive love in different ways. I think we all assume that everyone wants the same things from a partner that we do, but that's just not true. Honestly, I'm not sure you even need the book - the quiz is [online](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/quizzes/), and it reveals what your preferred ""love language"" is."
8767,lx07hw,3,Have you read/listened to The Hobbit?   I find that one to be my go-to when I need to shut out the world.
8768,lx07hw,3,Mathew McConaugheys new book Greenlights is really good and I believe he narrated it as well for audiobook.
8769,lx07hw,6,"*Ender's Game* is a sci-fi novel that is a nice listen! It is a little more mature than RP1, but it'll still scratch the itch for action."
8770,lx07hw,3,I just listened to that a couple months ago. I LOVED it. Thank you for the suggestion
8771,lx07hw,4,"Garden Spells by Sara Addison Allen, a charming, warm story about a woman who finds an unusual connection to her mother's garden

All her books are good, but this is my favorite."
8772,lx07hw,3,I’m a cancer survivor and i wish you all the beat with your treatment. I wasn’t reading a lot when i was diagnosed but i would recommend something more fantasy related  my favorites are The Golem and the Jinni or the Night Circus.  Where the Crawdads Sing was a great audiobook.
8773,lx0bl1,4,"[**Hiking with Nietzsche: On Becoming Who You Are**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37941732-hiking-with-nietzsche)

^(By: John Kaag | 272 pages | Published: 2018 | Popular Shelves: philosophy, non-fiction, memoir, biography, nonfiction | )[^(Search ""Hiking with Nietzsche"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Hiking with Nietzsche&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;A revelatory Alpine journey in the spirit of the great Romantic thinker Friedrich Nietzsche
&gt;
&gt;Hiking with Nietzsche: Becoming Who You Are is a tale of two philosophical journeys--one made by John Kaag as an introspective young man of nineteen, the other seventeen years later, in radically different circumstances: he is now a husband and father, and his wife and small child are in tow. Kaag sets off for the Swiss peaks above Sils Maria where Nietzsche wrote his landmark work Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Both of Kaag's journeys are made in search of the wisdom at the core of Nietzsche's philosophy, yet they deliver him to radically different interpretations and, more crucially, revelations about the human condition.
&gt;
&gt;Just as Kaag's acclaimed debut, American Philosophy: A Love Story, seamlessly wove together his philosophical discoveries with his search for meaning,  Hiking with Nietzsche is a fascinating exploration not only of Nietzsche's ideals but of how his experience of living relates to us as individuals in the twenty-first century. Bold, intimate, and rich with insight, Hiking with Nietzsche is about defeating complacency, balancing sanity and madness, and coming to grips with the unobtainable. As Kaag hikes, alone or with his family, but always with Nietzsche, he recognizes that even slipping can be instructive. It is in the process of climbing, and through the inevitable missteps, that one has the chance, in Nietzsche's words, to ""become who you are.""

To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee.  This book continues to teach me valuable, all be it under used, lessons in life.  I learned about beauty not being just about a person's physical presence.  I read this book as a young punk teen, and I re-read it every year.  I promise you, I learn something new.  

Maude by Donna Foley Mabry.  Maude was written by her granddaughter.  She tells the story of Maude from her early childhood until her death.  What Maude lived through?  I don't think too many American's could live through her life today.  The woman was a rock.  No matter what crap got thrown at her, and she suffered a lot of crap, she got up every damn day and she tried.  On my pity party days, I remind myself of Maude and drag my sorry ass out of bed. If Maude could try at a time without air conditioning and tampons, so can I!"

8781,lx0bl1,6,Mansfield Park! I know she's unpopular but I love Fanny Price so much. I'm so glad I gave Austen another try after disliking Pride and Prejudice.
8782,lx0bl1,3,First- The Awakening by Kate Chopin. Read in highschool. Learned that I am a whole woman without a man. Second- Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault. Reading it now in graduate school and it is directing me towards my thesis!
8783,lx0bl1,5,The Red Tent meant so much to me as a young woman in high school!!
8784,lx0bl1,7,The Overstory by Richard Powers completely changed my attitude to nature
8785,lx0bl1,4,"""Flatland"" by Edwin Abbott

The way he describes how incomprehensible higher dimensions are through the example of lower dimensional characters is a pure stroke a genius. It made me start to question and fear the reality of reality. We will never know in our lifetime."
8786,lx0bl1,4,"I really should read Steinbeck, don't know what I've waited for."
8787,lx0bl1,6,High five! I’m also a Fanny Price fan! We’re rare but we exist
8788,lx0bl1,3,can I ask what about east of eden gave you this feeling? i haven’t read it but I constantly hear how good it is without any description of what makes it good.

8793,lx3gs1,10,"Marcel Proust’s *In search of lost time* would seem to me to be exactly what you’re looking for.  It also happens to be one of the jewels of world literature.

It’s a major investment of time and attention because of its length, and Proust’s discursive style, but absolutely worth it."

8795,lx3gs1,6,"In the category of ""plays with time in a unique way"": *Slaughterhouse-Five* by Kurt Vonnegut. It has a little bit of reflecting on aging/time passing, but is more about what it looks like to experience time nonlinearly."

8797,lx3gs1,3,The midnight library
8798,lx3gs1,3,"Ruth Ozeki's 'A Tale for the Time Being'. It explores time from the point of view of a really old Japanese nun, but also talks about other issues like bullying and relationship. I think the book description on Google does it better justice than whatever I've written but I highly recommend it. It's amazing."
8799,lx6fr1,21,"The Underland Chronicles by Suzanne Collins! I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the world building in this series is better than The Hunger Games."
8800,lx6fr1,32,"Gone Bamboo, a quirky and humorous action/thriller/mob story written by Anthony Bourdain. Tony was so well known for his culinary and travel books and television, many people don't know he also wrote a couple of fiction books."

8803,lx6fr1,9,Dandelion Wine is a fantastic and underrated Ray Bradbury novel.
8804,lx6fr1,3,"I don't know how much it's a ""niche"" work, but I never hear anyone talk about the shorter theater by Samuel Becket, which means that he's a writer of novels and 4 plays (maybe 4 if the person is on reddit.  Might be 2 or 3.  4 if you're talking to your barely intersted English teacher).

The reality is that compared to the old early-modern masters, like Molière or Shakespeare, Beckett didn't write a huge amount of theater, but the are 4 pieces that are between an hour an hour and two, and then there are about 20 pieces that range between 45 seconds (one piece is this short and is sort of a joke) and half an hour.  More its about 10 minutes and 30 minutes.  So I would want to point out:

Rough for theater 1 and 2 especially.

Also his novella First Love.  It's really pretty much as good as the first half of Molloy."
8805,lx6fr1,7,"Jules Verne’s Paris In The 20th Century was his novel that sought to predict what life would be like in 100 years, and it was “lost” until the 90s when it was translated and published in English."

8808,lx6fr1,3,"Has 2 sequels as well! I'd read the first one ""A graveyard for lunatics"" but wasn't even aware of the second one ""Let's all kill Constance"" until I looked it up just then!"
8809,lx6fr1,14,A Grief Observed by CS Lewis. I recommend it for anyone dealing with loss.
8810,lx6fr1,5,"""The Town and the City"" by Jack Kerouac.  It's his first novel, and the voice is completely different from what you expect.  The ""spontaneous prose"" of ""On the Road"" is not present here, instead this book is often compared to Thomas Wolfe"
8811,lx6fr1,16,"*Pnin* is a lesser-known work of Vladimir Nabokov which is quite fun. I believe Nabokov struggled to get it published.

I like a lot of Calvino's lesser known *Cosmicomics* as well. His cycle of adaptations of the Orpheus and Eurydice myths is great.

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry - *Wind, Sand and Stars* is less know outside France, and just as amazing as *The Little Prince*.

Edit: I also think people sleep on *The Buried Giant*, Kazuo Ishiguro's Arthurian fantasy novel. A deep message about societal trauma and forgetting, with a heartbreaking ending."
8812,lx6fr1,4,The Wind the Sand and Stars is one of my favorite books. EVER. so beautiful. I've even read about half of it in French.
8813,lx6fr1,3,incredible book.
8814,lx6fr1,5,"You know, I never hear people about The Island of Dr. Moreau by H.G. Wells. It’s my favorite by him. Also, no one ever talks about My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier. I think this one is even better than Rebecca 😬"
8815,lx6fr1,5,I second Dandelion Wine
8816,lx6fr1,3,"It's pretty short and the prose is wonderful as always, so a good intro in that sense. I'd say it's a lesser work compared to *Lolita*, *Bend Sinister* and *Pale Fire*. 

Saint-Exupéry is wonderful! I hesitated a bit recommending as it's not *that* niche, but *The Little Prince* is just so phenomenally popular it eclipses everything else."
8817,lx6fr1,4,Fevre Dream by George RR Martin

8822,lx6fr1,4,Or Breakfast of Champions.
8823,lx6fr1,3,Till We Have Faces by CS Lewis. Completely different than his children’s or religious books. Mythology and self introspection from a woman’s perspective. My favorite book.
8824,lx6fr1,3,"I am reading Anthony Bourdain: The Last Interview, and I had no idea he wrote fiction until I read this. I loved his travel shows and books so I'm excited to find more of his work."

8827,lx75a9,21,"The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb starting with [The Farseer Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farseer_Trilogy) is my personal favorite. NK Jemisin's series are really good as is Neil Gaiman. I'm kind of in the same boat, didn't keep up with reading for while and now feel totally out of touch, but I've found some good suggestions on this sub"
8828,lx75a9,17,"Anything from Brandon Sanderson 

The Witcher books

The Name of the Wind (be warned, we’ve been waiting on the final book to be released for years. I still have hopes it’ll be soon though lol)

The First Law trilogy"
8829,lx75a9,4,Game of thrones
8830,lx75a9,11,"Brandon Sanderson is great.  Going to recommend the Mistborn series and The Reckoners series. But you can’t go wrong with anything he’s written. 

The Belgariad series by David Eddings. Some of my favorite characters live here. 

The Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind (Long, but so worthwhile)

Good Omens is absolutely a terrific ride. Completely ridiculous and fantastically hilarious. Must read. Very short."
8831,lx75a9,4,Came to recommend Robin Hobbs Farseer Trilogy!
8832,lx75a9,4,"If you loved Eragon, Christopher Paolini published his first adult focused book last year called To Sleep in a Sea of Stars."

8835,lx75a9,8,"The Stormlight Archive has some of the most fun worldbuilding and great characters, and is so far insanely satisfying."
8836,lx75a9,3,"The Warded Man by Peter V Brett.  Relatively unknown but incredible fantasy and world and character building.  You won’t get dragons, but prophesy, demons, and conflicting magic"
8837,lx75a9,3,The Fionavar Tapestry by Guy Gavriel Kay. Especially if you liked Lord of the Rings!
8838,lxbyg0,87,"Beyond anything else and the myriad of recs you’re going to get I just want to say congratulations and good for you! 

It might not be what you’re into, but {{Bag of Bones}} was the last book that reallllllyyyyyy sucked me in. It’s pretty mild on the scare meter, but damn was I hooked."
8839,lxbyg0,4,I legitimately believe all 6 of these recommendations are from me. Thanks bot
8840,lxbyg0,26,"Shogun by James Clavell 

The Winds of War...and...
War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk. 

These are oldies but goodies. Old fashioned page turners and good writers. Started me down my path of rabid historical fiction reading when I was a teenager, (a habit which has just recently saved me from mid life events and a bout of heavy drinking as well, so I really relate to your sentiment!)

8842,lxbyg0,6,"I read a few of his books when I was a teenager and I was not impressed and really thought he was overrated hype for years. Eventually I moved out of that and thought I’ll give this one a try, almost entirely because I had never heard of it so there was zero hype either way. Loved it and had totally made me reconsider the corner I painted him in."

8844,lxbyg0,6,I think it was me and not him tbh lol. I couldn’t appreciate a slow burn. I started with I think Pet Sematary and I was mad that nothing happened for half the book. I understand pacing and all that differently now. But at 16 I was like “boooooringg”. Then I tried Dreamcatcher..I still don’t want to talk about that one. Maybe one day I’ll give it another chance but..probably not.
8845,lxbyg0,10,"Oh! That makes me think of another suggestion, OP... you might really enjoy Stephen King’s Mr. Mercedes trilogy. It’s his first foray into the crime/detective genre, and it’s a crazy good read."

8847,lxbyg0,3,"Another Herman Wouk fan!  He’s so good, and these two books in particular, that I spent an entire summer recommending Wouk to anyone I met.  Marjorie Morningstar has some scenes that are so funny that tears ran down my face."

8849,lxbyg0,3,*In Harm's Way: The Sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors* by Doug Stanton. It’s legitimately so gripping that I read the entire book in one sitting. You mentioned you read some historical bios (those are my favorite too) so I think you’ll enjoy this one.
8850,lxbyg0,6,"I have not read any of the books you mentioned, but based on your request for a well-written thriller (or at least something that's well-written and fast-paced) I can recommend the following books that I absolutely could not put down:

- {{Rebecca}} - my favorite novel of all time
- {{Piranesi}}
- {{Gone Girl}}
- {{Annihilation}} - some people find this slow, but I couldn't put it down
- {{The Screaming Staircase}} - this is YA but doesn't really have any of the stereotypical cringey tropes, so if you like the concept then give it a try
- {{Fortune's Pawn}}
- {{Sharp Objects}}
- {{All Systems Red}} - the blurb sounds blah but this is actually fantastic
- {{The Martian}} (and from what I hear, I'd pick up {{Project Hail Mary}} when it's released)....the writing is kind of blah compared to the others on this list, but it's still compelling

Edit: looks like the Goodreads bot doesn't like something about this..."

8852,lxbyg0,7,"{{into thin air}}  Jon krakauer is a great writer. This book is about the deadliest season on Everest. He happened to be up there writing an article so it’s quite the account. 

I’ve also recently picked up {{when you are engulfed in flames}} it’s a different speed but David Sedaris’ writing is funny and a bit morbid but very human. If that makes sense. It’s a bunch of essays so easy read"

&gt;A bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that ""suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down."" He was wrong. The storm, which claimed five lives and left countless more--including Krakauer's--in guilt-ridden disarray, would also provide the impetus for Into Thin Air, Krakauer's epic account of the May 1996 disaster.

&gt;It's early autumn 1964. Two straight-A students head off to school, and when only one of them returns home Chesney Yelverton is coaxed from retirement and assigned to what proves to be the most difficult and deadly - case of his career. From the shining notorious East Side, When You Are Engulfed in Flames confirms once again that David Sedaris is a master of mystery and suspense.
&gt;
&gt;Or how about...
&gt;
&gt;when set on fire, most of us either fumble for our wallets or waste valuable time feeling sorry for ourselves. David Sedaris has studied this phenomenon, and his resulting insights may very well save your life. Author of the national bestsellers Should You Be Attacked By Snakes and If You Are Surrounded by Mean Ghosts, David Sedaris, with When You Are Engulfed in Flames, is clearly at the top of his game.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, all right...
&gt;
&gt;David Sedaris has written yet another book of essays (his sixth). Subjects include a parasitic worm that once lived in his mother-in-law's leg, an encounter with a dingo, and the recreational use of an external catheter. Also recounted is the buying of a human skeleton and the author's attempt to quit smoking In Tokyo.
&gt;
&gt;Master of nothing, at the dead center of his game, Sedaris proves that when you play with matches, you sometimes light the whole pack on fire.

&gt;Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.
&gt;
&gt;There is one other person in the house—a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.
&gt;
&gt;For readers of Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane and fans of Madeline Miller's Circe, Piranesi introduces an astonishing new world, an infinite labyrinth, full of startling images and surreal beauty, haunted by the tides and the clouds.

&gt;Marriage can be a real killer.
&gt;
&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?
&gt;
&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?
&gt;
&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.
&gt;
&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.

&gt;Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In Annihilation, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy, we join the twelfth expedition.
&gt;
&gt;The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.
&gt;
&gt;They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.

8864,lxbyg0,3,"Seconded. It's a little on the literary side and Eco takes no prisoners, expecting a lot from his readers, but this is without doubt his most accessible novel and a greater starting point. The central conceit is fantastic and, if you enjoy it, you be we'll set to wade further into his madness with {Foucault's Pendulum} or {Baudolino} which follow similar themes but, with the exception of the former, less of an overt 'thriller' tag."

If you like mystery novels but don't like the super-flashy criminals that loudly announce their intentions to the police from the VIP seat of a booming nightclub that they own, you might try Malcolm Mackay's Glasgow Trilogy.

8909,lxwycx,16,"i’ve heard a lot about the book “All The Bright Places” and how it portrays depression well, another one i’ve heard about is “Fans of the Impossible Life”, lastly “It’s Kind Of A Funny Story” is a really good book and movie that i personally think explains depression among other things really well."
8910,lxwycx,5,A good point—thanks for bringing that up!
8911,lxwycx,41,"I've had the Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression by Andrew Solomon on my to-read list for awhile and might fit the bill for you. It's supposed to be very good - won a national book award and was a Pulitzer finalist.

I read the Midnight Library by Matt Haig recently (suicide TW) and it was very well done. Fantasy/magical realism about trying out all the possible lives you could have lived if you had made different choices. Matt Haig is very open about his mental health struggles and I've heard his other books are fantastic as well (Reasons to Stay Alive, How to Stop Time for example).

For a very ridiculous and funny memoir, Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson was excellent. I can see why some don't like her humor though, so if you try it and don't like it immediately, don't worry about putting it down (it's pretty constant throughout). She goes off on a lot of tangents and is obsessed with a variety of taxidermied animals.

Also, just wanted to say thank you for doing this! You sound like a great teacher.

Edit: spelling"
8912,lxwycx,12,"Adib Khorram’s books Darius the Great is Not Okay, and Darius the Great Deserves Better have a protagonist that has depression and shows how he manages it with medication (and therapy I think?). His dad also has it, and he faces dark moments, but I think it’s a pretty hopeful and grounded depiction of how you can still live a great life."
8913,lxwycx,31,Matt Haig has pretty publicly dealt with depression and related writers block. His book Reasons to Stay Alive is a great tool &amp; resource.
8914,lxwycx,72,i read “it’s kind of a funny story” when i was 13 and really related to the main character.

8917,lxwycx,16,"Seconding Matt Haig's work. Not targeted at teen experiences necessarily, but I really loved Haig's The Midnight Library! As opposed to giving tools or discussing it scientifically, it really beautifully illustrates depression and its potential consequences through a genuinely captivating story."

8922,lxwycx,12,"This might sound like a weird recommendation, but {The Coddling of the American Mind}. 
It’s a non fiction book written by two professors that focuses on how three “untruths” that college aged students are seeing as truths. The book then moved to explain how to work around them and help students improve their self awareness and develop resources to deal with the world and its frustrations."

8924,lxwycx,9,"This might be a bit broader than what you are looking for...Nonetheless, I recommend all of Frantz Fanons work but specifically his short letter: ‘Letter to the Resident Minister (1956)’ found in Toward the African Revolution:

“The function of a social structure is to set up institutions to serve man's needs. A society that drives its members to desperate solutions is a non-viable society, a society to be replaced.”

Might seem like a stretch, but Fanon looks at how colonial/capitalist society leads to alienation, depression and all sorts of other issues. In this context, you cannot make someone whole without addressing the underlying issues. The Sane Society by Erich Fromm covers similar ideas too."
8925,lxwycx,8,"Upvoting for ""it's kind of a funny story"". Thats a great read"
8926,lxwycx,4,One of the best memoirs that helped me understand depression was Matt Haig’s “reasons to stay alive”.
8927,lxwycx,6,I agree with both comments! Matt is amazing!
8928,lxwycx,206,"Don't have a rec unfortunately, but just wanted to say as someone who works in mental health support in schools: having teachers that care about understanding mental health issues is one of the BIGGEST things to make a positive impact for students who are struggling/have a mental illness.

&gt;The physics of vulnerability is simple: If we are brave enough often enough, we will fall. The author of Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection tells us what it takes to get back up, and how owning our stories of disappointment, failure, and heartbreak gives us the power to write a daring new ending. Struggle, Brené Brown writes, can be our greatest call to courage, and rising strong our clearest path to deeper meaning, wisdom, and hope.

&gt;New York Times best-selling author and professor Brené Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.
&gt;
&gt;Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.

8944,nyysrl,4,There is a book called S.O.S. for Emotions that I use to teach young men how to explain their emotions to others. It is not written in any highly complex way and I have found it to be an incredible starting place for the kids

8947,nyzjb6,8,The Philosophy Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained is a good overview.  It starts out with Philosophy and philosophers from the ancient world and progresses through the modern era
8948,nyzjb6,9,"It's been a while since I read it, but you might be interested in \{Sophie's World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy\} by Jostein Gaarder as an accessible way to learn about philosophy through a novel narrative."
8949,nyzjb6,3,"Start with a short book by a contemporary philosopher written for an intro class. E.g.:

Simon Blackburn, *Think* (general intro)

Ted Sider, *Riddles of Existence* (metaphysics)

Michael Sandel, *Justice* (political philosophy)

Peter Singer, *Applied Ethics* (what the name says)

Advantages of such books over literary or semi-literary works: (1) each covers a much wider range of topics (you won't find epistemology or abortion discussed in Sophie's Choice, for example); (2) views and arguments not hidden unarticulated in stories, but presented in plain, straightforward language; (3) gateway to further studies as most of them come with ""further readings"" lists."

&gt;It is 1970, and a down-at-the-heels California commune devoted to peace, free love, and the simple life has decided to relocate to the last frontier—the unforgiving landscape of interior Alaska—in the ultimate expression of going back to the land. Armed with the spirit of adventure and naïve optimism, the inhabitants of “Drop City” arrive in the wilderness of Alaska only to find their utopia already populated by other young homesteaders. When the two communities collide, unexpected friendships and dangerous enmities are born as everyone struggles with the bare essentials of life: love, nourishment, and a roof over one’s head. Rich, allusive, and unsentimental, T.C. Boyle’s ninth novel is a tour de force infused with the lyricism and take-no-prisoners storytelling for which he is justly famous.

&gt;After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.

{{Happiest Baby on the Block}} (tagging this, but just watch the movie - I think you can buy it pretty cheap on Amazon streaming.) 

{{Mom Truths}} (more of a humorous read, but could be a good one to help you and your child’s mother laugh together and have things to discuss.) 

{{Rising Strong}} (this is more about being your authentic self and recognizing and nurturing that in others. I think it could be especially inspiring/life changing given your past few months. Her other book “Gifts of Imperfection” may interest you too.)"

Enjoy it as much as you can and when you find yourself not enjoying it and feeling bad about it just give yourself a pat on the back and let it go.

It can also give you some things to be excited about down the road.

 I'm a relatively new father myself. (My son is 10 months old today) I went through something very similar. A short time in, when all I've really experienced are seemingly endless bouts of screaming, failed feedings, and dozens on top of dozens of soiled diapers, I really began to doubt myself. Could I really do this? Am I strong enough? Am I really OK with putting my wants on the back burner at a moments notice indefinitely for the foreseeable future? It was pretty rough trying to reel in my own insecurities and doubts while trying to help my wife control hers as well. His colic really didn't help things. On top of all that, my generalized anxiety disorder only seemed to fuel my doubts and led to a few panic attacks. But, bit by bit, I began to see little things that just filled me with joy. His first smile. Him getting up on his hands and knees. His reaction when I sang to him. It makes all the sleepless nights and stress-induced hair pulling worth it. Now, it feels like those nights where we sat on our bed at 2 in the morning, taking turns trying to feed a screaming baby until it was time to go to work are so distant. It's cliche to say that having a child can bring you a joy unlike anything you've ever experienced, but there really isn't a better way to describe it.

To doubt is human, particularly when you're putting a major amount of effort in. And it sucks, so so much, to hear ""Just wait, it's hard now, but better things are ahead."" But there isn't a better way to put that either. I'm sorry I don't have a book closer to what you were looking for to recommend, but I wanted to respond anyway because I've been where you are now, and I've been there recently. It's beyond rough and then some, but the rewards later are grander than grand. I wish you all the luck in the world in your parenting journey. It's quite the adventure."
9014,nz8qet,3,"Home Game by Michael Lewis, and Dad is Fat by Jim Gaffigan have some funny stories about fatherhood. I enjoyed both when I first became a dad. Congrats!"
9015,nz8qet,25,"First of all I want to wish you a Happy (early) first father's day.  

I don't have any book recommendations but I saw your post and really felt compelled to leave you a message.

My wife gave birth to our first and only child 3 years ago, he was definitely not planned, although we weren't taking any precautions so not super surprising either.  

Honestly things were tough going for me at first, I wasn't really sure I wanted to be a dad.  Growing up wasn't a super happy time for me and I had a lot of reservations about not being a good dad.  

I grew up in the 80's, mom left when I was 4 and my (newly single) dad was tasked with raising me and my older brother.  Looking back I know that he tried his best, but he was also a pretty emotionally unavailable dad and frankly this really fucked me up and was the cause of a lot of my hesitation about fatherhood.  

It took months and months of anxiety but I finally realized that my wife and son had nothing to do with my unhappy childhood or my hesitancy about fatherhood, so it wasn't fair to them to be stuck in the middle with me and my issues,  I decided that I needed to do everything I could to deal with my issues and make the best of things.  

I wanted to make sure that I was a more emotionally available parent, so I tell my son I love him as often as I can.  He gets all the hugs and kisses he wants and I try to spend as much time as possible with him.  Thanks to covid I've been working from home for 15ish months and so I get to see him all the time.  One of our favourite routines is bedtime he and I cuddle up in his bed and I read to him.  Most nights he and I actually doze off together in his tiny bed, thankfully I'm not a tall guy. 

I don't know what your situation is or what your concerns about fatherhood are, but I want you to know that it's the best thing in my life.  It's an unbelievable amount of work, it's exhausting and can be gut wrenching, but seeing my son smile, or laugh, or get excited to read stories with me at night, make me realize that it's all worth it.  

I really hope that you are able to sort out whatever your concerns are, don't be afraid to ask for help or talk with you gf about what's going on.  Also feel free to drop me a message if you want."
9016,nz8qet,3,"A personal matter, Kenzaburo oe"
9017,nz8qet,19,Can't recommend bringing up bebe more! I'd also get the Oh crap series on potty training and raising a toddler. I know you are a bit far from that but they are great as well!
9018,nz8qet,3,"Aww man, this is my domain. I have like 15 books on parenting. I wish I was kidding. I also recommend that you go to r/Predaddit and r/Daddit. There’s a lot of advice and even some reading recommendations there. I’ll give you the books that I found most helpful. Since you’re an engineering student, I don’t imagine you’ll shy away from a reference text or two. I was a medical student, but I found some of these written very well for laypeople.

1.	Getting Your Baby to Sleep the Baby Sleep Trainer Way by Natalie Willes.
2.	American Academy of Pediatrics: Caring for your baby from birth to age 5
3.	What to expect in the first year (or something like that)
4.	Happiest baby on the block by Harvey Karp (you might be a LITTLE late to this one, but you need to skim it at least.)
5.	Baby 411

There’s one by mayo clinic too, but that has a lot of overlap with the AAP book. This is all you really actually need. Avoid pseudosciency/poorly referenced junk because there is a LOT of bad advice out there. Babies are easy, they don’t need a manual but parents tend to mess up by overtweaking things or doing things the way their parents did them. If you’re only going to get one book, the AAP book is a great reference point and very readable.

[And these ones, the most important books of all.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0761193081?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image)"
9019,nz8qet,6,"Parenting with Presence: Practices for Raising Conscious, Confident, Caring Kids by Eckhart Tolle."
9020,nz8qet,3,"Along those same lines, any of Clint Edwards’ books."
9021,nz8qet,7,"I think the engineer in you will appreciate The Baby Owner's Manual by Joe Borgenicht and Louis Borgenicht

It's a quick read with practical advice, and you'll need to sleep more than read right now."
9022,nz8qet,3,"I suggest .... michael pollens - a place of my own. 

Its about building a shed but change and grow and zen."
9023,nz8qet,7,"Try to take care of yourself. What I needed when I had my baby was a strong, steady husband who could “talk me down” from my hormonal rollercoasters. So, if you’re taking care of you then you can take care of her and babe. Mental health is so important! Be confident. The universe/God never gives you more than you can handle!"
9024,nz8qet,56,"A++ if the baby is sleeping you try to sleep too. It’s so tempting to try and catch up on chores piling up but sleep and self care are #1. Without you baby is fubar. 

I took a dad class weekend thing. Like 4 hour class about changing, feeding, and stuff. 

The most important one for emergencies is baby CPR. Make the spock sign and put hand on chest with fingers at upper chest / neck. Flip them head down on your upper arm and whack that back until the choke comes out. 

Sometimes babies cry it’s nothing against you personally. If you ever feel some anger coming just put the baby in a physically safe place like crib or a box and go walk away for three minutes. 

They only need 3 main things. Food, diaper, and sleep. If they are fed and clean diaper but still fussy sometimes just gotta let them ride it out. Mine sleep better after a poop and bath. especially if sticky from sweat or something.

Getting them to sleep is different for all kids but most seem to fall asleep easiest on a person. Ideally you want to sleep train them early as possible to sleep on their own. I co slept with my first one and 5 years later he still clingy af and difficult to make him sleep in his own bed which is right next to ours.

Good luck may the force be with you!"

9028,nz8qet,3,Born Dancing by Evelyn Thoman. It’s very old but it’s the best book to take away new parent anxiety and learn how to trust yourself and your baby. It was given to me by a top infant expert and saved me when I was a new parent.

9031,nz8qet,8,"For real. Side recommend, Taking Cara Babies has been a godsend to a handful of parents I know. 

To save writing multiple comments, I’d like to endorse Whole Brain Child here too. Lots of other quality recommends.

My biggest recommendation is actually going to be between you and your partner. The way you communicated before is likely going to be much different, and should. Learn how to problem solve together, how to understand your partner’s new role/priorities/mindset and how those will change the daily life you were used to. It sounds like you have lots of stressful things on your plate (new parenthood (❤️❤️), relationship, student, engineering major, normal chaos of everyday life) please remember to give yourself grace and breaks. You can do what you have to do, the people around you are resources.

Good luck on your journey! Here are your tall socks and white New Balance shoes, clickable grilling tongs, and a map of the closest Applebees."

CPR is performed when the infant is not conscious and not breathing. The technique uses either two finger or whole hand, depends on the size of the infant. I recommend a full CPR class."

It's good to play audio of some sort when they sleep. If you always let them sleep in dead silence (and walk on eggshells during that time), they'll get used to that. You don't want that! Play music, play audio books, wind up a music box, read to them if you have time, keep the window open so city/country noises are more audible, etc. As long as it's a regular consistent frequency, it shouldn't wake them up."

9048,nzcou2,3,"It’s very different from any of what you list off and they’re (excellent) middle school age books, but perhaps Wise Child and Juniper? They’re pretty different from each other, as well - they weren’t originally written as a series, so they don’t quite line up as one. Can be read in either order or as stand alone books. Wise Child is less magic focused than Juniper.

You may also like the Earthsea books, particularly “Tales from Earthsea”. There’s some grandiosity, but not much.

Edited to add: oh, Also - and perhaps closer to what you’re asking for:

Many of LeGuin’s short stories. Buffalo Gals won’t you Come Out Tonight; Directions of the Road; The White Donkey; On the High Marsh: Ether, OR; etc. And the book Changing Planes.

Several of N. K. Jemisin’s short stories - Red Dirt Witch and “Cloud Dragon Skies” both come to mind - both are in “How Long ‘till Black Future Month."

9063,nzjdku,11,"Victorian literature is thick with the prototypes of these narrators. Give Vanity Fair a go if you don't mind sacrificing a couple of weeks - everything the narrator says is thick with irony, so while not completely snarky, is definitely having fun."
9064,nzjdku,9,"I think ""breaking the fourth wall"" is when a *character* addresses the reader. The narrator is supposed to address the reader, so that doesn't break conventions."
9065,nzjdku,6,"Two more subtle examples: 
A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles doesn’t have a character narrator per se, but definitely had a distinct narratorial voice.
The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin is told in a very unique, conversational way, where the narrator is talking to “you.”"
9066,nzjdku,14,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is fricking hilarious for this very reason.
9067,nzjdku,4,"The Bartimeaus Trilogy by Jonathan Stroud! They are technically young adult and so good! They are a sort of alternate history of England (and the world) where magicians are real and are involved in the most of the government. They get there power by summoning different magical beings from “The Other Place”. The book switches perspective between Nathaniel, a young magician, and Bartimeaus, the djinn he summons. Bartimeaus is a hilarious narrator and uses footnotes to talk directly the the reader and make jokes, add historical context, or just make fun of humans. They are real good!"

9069,nzjdku,3,Just finished Plain Bad Heroines by Emily Danforth and there were a lot of snarky footnotes from the narrator!
9070,nzjdku,3,"The narrator is just the person telling the story. It can be a character or not. 

When the narrator is NOT a character in the story (3rd person POV, e.g.) maybe metafictional narrative might be the better term (or maybe there is another term or no term) but I have certainly heard others use the ""breaking the 4th wall"" in a similar way when a 3rd omniscient narrator has their own personality and addresses the reader more directly than usual."
9071,nzjdku,3,"I think you'll love Italo Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a Traveller. Basically, the setup of the book is that you are about to read a book called... If on a Winter's Bight a Traveller... HOWEVER, there seems to be some mistake. The narrator guides you through the opening, and then the chapter just... stops. It then starts off somewhere completely different. Is this even the same book? 

Basically, the narrator is as confused as you are. It might be interesting to read a bit more about ""postmodernism"" and ""metafiction"" for this kind of literature, it'll make things a lot less frustrating if you know WHY you are confused instead of thinking ""well this is a shit author"".

Another example is Laurence Sterne's book The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. It is basically the book that kickstarted the anti-romance, which what we would later start to call ""novel"". It's great satire, though it may require quite a bit of energy to read it because it deliberately tries to make it difficult. There are tangents that last forever, the narrator can't seem to make a coherent point, there basically is no plot (because of what I just said)... and that's the point: he's making fun of the long romances of his day."

9073,nzkm3r,3,"I Will Bear Witness, Vols. I &amp; II, by Victor Klemperer, are diaries by a Jewish professor during the years that Hitler came to power in Germany. It is an amazing, personal look at how attitudes from his employers, neighbors, even his local grocer, went from being friendly to him losing his job, his ability to move about the city, his ability to purchase food, even losing the right to own and keep a pet. 

Powerful reading."
9074,nzkm3r,3,"I’m always reccing this one, but definitely give {{Malintzin’s Choices}} a try! It’s a well-researched book on the Spanish conquest of Central America, but from the indigenous point of view. Despite being non-fiction, it’s written like a narrative of Malintzin’s life, with the gaps in the historical record filled in with well-educated guesses.

Its got a similar vibe to Percy Jackson in that its clearly written for a younger audience but is just as engaging for adults.

He was the best, EXCEPT that the protagonist‘s love interest is always a 14/16 years old girl and the protagonist a 30/40 years old man.

Took a little wind out of the sails there, but hey, they're both dead now so it's not like you're rewarding them for their behavior.

Also, the Troy Rising series by John Ringo is something I blazed through in a week, absolutely adoring the tech, the scale, the action, and a fair chunk of the dialogue and concepts. It *also* explicitly endorses unregulated monopolies, implicitly endorses genocide, (the characters feel real bad about it though, guys, honestly) and gives the human race a disease that makes women periodically go into heat, before then dedicating *an entire b-plot to explaining why Mexicans can't operate a space battlestation.* I've reread it but I can't in good conscience recommend it to others..."
9129,nzlu96,4,"Disgrace by J. M. Coetzee. Great book but filled with sexual exploitation of women. Also, I recently started to re-read “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” by Ken Kesey (brilliant author that I read all of many years ago) and it had a lot of racist stereotypes. I had to stop reading."
9130,nzlu96,19,"I don’t know if this exactly what you are looking to hear, but man, I need to vent about this, so here I go . . . 

Mists of Avalon. The author turned out to be supplying her husband with kids for his pedophelia/turned her head the other way. She is dead and all her book sales go to survivor non-profits. 

But yeah. Kind of like how you can’t even talk about it, like Woody Allen movies, even though they were brilliant and genre defining (mists was/is considered one of the greatest feminist works of fiction of all time.) But worse, because of course men who do bad things are given more leeway for their creative endeavors than women when they are scum. Like, nobody jumps down anyone’s throat if they say their favorite movie is associated with Henry Weinstein (seriously, so many movies!) 

Don’t get me wrong, *I fully think the author is scum of the earth, and I hope she is now in hell,* but also this is problematic if/when the book comes up as one of my faves/the *exact story* someone is looking to read (e.g. on this sub if someone asks, *I’d like a feminist retelling of Arthurian legends*, which happens fairly often, I get downvoted to hell and people go on a spirally rant about the author.) 

I read the book for the first time literally decades before anything came out about her, so it’s not like my mind can say, “that book is awful.” The book isn’t the issue, it’s the author. (Of course some people just don’t care for the book, and that’s totally fine, it’s subjective. But to say it is horrible because the author is horrible isn’t logical and it bothers me.) Like, Annie Hall isn’t terrible, Woody is terrible. He shouldn’t be allowed to work in the industry any longer, and his sales should go to non-profits, but that doesn’t mean his work previously was garbage.

Now I brace myself for utter downvote annihilation 😆😉."
9131,nzlu96,3,"THANK YOU for posting this. I think you've done exactly the right thing, and we will do well to get used to routinely calling out the reason the author/artist/musician, or present-day or historical figures must be considered in the light of their actions and their expressed biases and distortions."
9132,nzlu96,4,"SUCH a fantastic book. I've read it twice and it's so conflicting. How can you condemn the relationship, but at the same time how could you ever condone it? I want to recommend it to people but it's such a difficult read that I fear how it will reflect on me."
9133,nzlu96,6,"Sometimes, though, you look back and you realize that the works themselves DO reflect their authors’ biases or problematic behaviors. It’s not always so binary. There are an awful lot of Woody Allen movies where there’s an extremely young woman falling for a much, much older man—sometimes Allen himself. Brilliant and genre-defining, sure, but also revealing of his gross issues, and also taking up so much critical oxygen that other voices could have used."
9134,nzlu96,4,"Absolutely! I agree, and I do think it’s important that we do this (revisit, revise, and reflect.) Sometimes it still doesn’t change the fact that the work changed you/connected with in some essential way and is still a worthwhile piece (to you/an individual - this is totally subjective!) despite its flaws. 

Edit: Also, it could still be an essential worthwhile historical piece in the creation of a genre or art form even after reflecting on the problems of a work. The authors’ actions and morals don’t often change the fact that something is a seminal work in its field. Yes, it should absolutely be critiqued and acknowledged as problematic, but it shouldn’t be dismissed as something that didn’t have importance, value, influence during its time and place.
I think it’s even more problematic to pretend it never existed and never discuss these works because their authors. It’s all an important dialogue. (U.S. founding fathers’ come to mind when thinking of this, as do people like Henry Ford. Nobody’s calling for a ban on all Ford motor vehicles, to pretend they never existed, and that the company never had influence in the industry just because he was a nazi sympathizer.)"
9135,nzlu96,6,"*The Three-Body Problem* trilogy is super imaginative, epic, and captivating.

....but oh man the misogyny is very weird. There is some weird incel-like stuff in book 2 where a character invents his ""perfect woman"" in his head, falls in love with her and leaves his girlfriend for her, even going on trips with the imaginary woman. Later on, he seeks out and finds essentially this exact person. She at one memorable point is described as having a masters so she's smart, but not a phd so not *too* smart. Ugh. It's not treated like he's in the wrong for such non-person idealization. The ""perfect"" woman even falls for him.

Then in the third book there is some weird uncomfortable stuff a hundred or so years in the future where humanity has some major issues and the book almost explicitly says its because humanity has grown too woman-like.

&gt;The physics of vulnerability is simple: If we are brave enough often enough, we will fall. The author of Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection tells us what it takes to get back up, and how owning our stories of disappointment, failure, and heartbreak gives us the power to write a daring new ending.

&gt;New York Times best-selling author and professor Brené Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.
&gt;
&gt;Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.

Can I make a simple, additional recommendation? Give them “floor time.” What I mean is get down on the floor and play with them on your hands and knees when they are tiny. Chase them, tickle them and play games. 

Stay on the floor for as many years as you can. My kids loved it when I sat on the floor because they were free to play, wrestle and just jump on dad a lot. This behavior continues into their teens though it was pretty aggressive play sometimes.

A wonderful side effect is that after a half hour or more of floor time, they would want to talk. They always started those questions with “Why Dad…” and those are my most cherished memories.

&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;    If you grew up with an emotionally immature, unavailable, or selfish parent, you may have lingering feelings of anger, loneliness, betrayal, or abandonment. You may recall your childhood as a time when your emotional needs were not met, when your feelings were dismissed, or when you took on adult levels of responsibility in an effort to compensate for your parent’s behavior. These wounds can be healed, and you can move forward in your life.
&gt;  
&gt;  In this breakthrough book, clinical psychologist Lindsay Gibson exposes the destructive nature of parents who are emotionally immature or unavailable. You will see how these parents create a sense of neglect, and discover ways to heal from the pain and confusion caused by your childhood. By freeing yourself from your parents’ emotional immaturity, you can recover your true nature, control how you react to them, and avoid disappointment. Finally, you’ll learn how to create positive, new relationships so you can build a better life.
&gt;  Discover the four types of difficult parents:
&gt;   
&gt;     The emotional parent instills feelings of instability and anxiety 
&gt;     The driven parent stays busy trying to perfect everything and everyone 
&gt;     The passive parent avoids dealing with anything upsetting 
&gt;     The rejecting parent is withdrawn, dismissive, and derogatory

9216,nzpn93,5,"Props to you for wanting to be the best parent you can be!

As a girl who has had a father and a step father, this is what I remember most fondly about them:

1. Just being there. Showing up, for the good and the bad. You don’t need to have answers or solutions, that’s not what kids are looking for anyway. Just let them know you love them no matter what, and listen to whatever they have to say.
2. Little traditions! My dad and I got donuts every Sunday morning my entire childhood. It was only him and I (with my brother and mother at home) where I was able to get his undivided attention for half an hour. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but multiply that by every weekend for 15 years… it adds up. 
3. Trying new things! My step dad showed me new types of music and different types of food that are my favorites to this day. I can’t eat sushi and not think of him. 
4. Total acceptance. I could tell my dad and my step dad anything, and I know they would love me no matter what.

But I just have to say that if you’re aware of this pattern and are already making efforts to prevent continuing it, you are much further along than you think. There is no such thing as a perfect parent—it’s the effort that counts."

^(By: Johann Hari | 322 pages | Published: 2018 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, psychology, nonfiction, self-help, mental-health | )[^(Search ""Lost Connections"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Lost Connections&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.
&gt;
&gt;Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told—like his entire generation—that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this question—and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. 
&gt;
&gt;Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hari’s journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin—all showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights. They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.
&gt;
&gt;Just as Chasing the Scream transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, Lost Connections will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxiety—one that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.

9221,nzpuru,3,"That book was an anchor for me in an extremely dark time. 

It not any sort of self-help, it's just a very accurate description of major depression, which really let me know I was not unique and was cycling through a darkness that others have gotten through before."

9223,nzsawr,14,A Prayer for Owen Meany is about a kid who accidentally kills his best friend’s mom and then believes that he has been chosen by God to do His will. Narrated by the best friend. Set in small town New England with a lot of weird characters.

{{Gideon the Ninth}}

These books both made me say ""What the heck is this?"" and are both awesome."
9226,nzsawr,42,"*The Memory Theater* by Karin Tidbeck is wonderfully bizarre and expertly written.  A ""portal"" story that is refreshing and different than others of that same genre.  Both magical realism and weird fiction.

*What Big Teeth* by Rose Szabo is a little whimsical yet dark, features a woman who returns home to her highly dysfunctional and unusual family.  It's an easy read, and while not perfect, enjoyable if you don't mind a touch of horror and a touch of family drama.

*The Starless Sea* is very popular on this site, and has a man who falls down a rabbit hole of literary driven mystery. Gets a little esoteric by the end, but has some neat moments.

*Ten Thousand Doors of January* is an excellent book about a young girl who is trying to track down her parents who have disappeared into another dimension.

*Piranesi* is a quick read. About a man who lives in a mysterious house/castle. The house is just as much of a character as anyone, and has some mystery involving who the MC is and how he got there.

*This Is How You Lose the Time War* by Amal El-Mohtar is written like a series of love letters. Very interesting and romantic.

*A Children's Bible* by Lydia Millet is funny and clever. Basically plays out like a biblical allegory but set in modern era. Was well loved on Best Of lists last year.

*The Ocean at the End of the Lane* by Neil Gaiman is his newest. Very twee and sweet, reads a lot like his classic *Coraline*.

*The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton is filled with manipulative characters and nothing is quite what it seems.  A man wakes up without memories and is trying to not only piece together his identity, but also solve a murder in the process!  Do yourself a favor and don't read spoilers on this, just dive in.

*The City We Became* is a modern fantasy tale set in NYC. It's very frantic and wild, but once the story kicks in it weaves a very unique story involving Lovecraftian twists. What makes this so cool is that every city in the world has an ""avatar"" that acts as it's protector of sorts.  Very hip and modern, smart and snarky.

*Tender Is The Flesh* is one of those horror books that is truly terrifying but in an American Psycho way. You are nauseous the entire time you read it and can't quite believe you've read something so shocking and disturbing.

*House of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski is bound to come up. It's creepy and weird for sure, but most of what makes the book so well loved is the experimentation with typography. It's an experience book for sure. Same with *The Raw Shark Texts* by Steven Hall which is equally as strange and experimental.

*Ring Shout* by P. Djèlí Clark is about three female demon slayers. A fun and fast ride. Think Buffy the Vampire Slayer vs the KKK.  Just won the Hugo for Best Novella of 2020.

*The Gone World* by Tom Sweterlitsch - A time traveling government worker finds the end of the world, and goes back in time to try and figure out how to stop it.

*The Only Good Indians* by Stephen Graham Jones is an emotionally raw horror book that features a group of friends who upset nature's order. Interesting read in that the tone changes with each character, some in frantic ways to help guide the reader through that character's struggles with anxiety or substance abuse.

*The Library at Mount Char* by Scott Hawkins is a wild horror book that is about a group of young kids raised by a god-like figurehead. They grow up and he disappears. The kids need to figure out what happened to him, deal with each other, and the humans that don't understand the powers they control. Gets pretty trippy by the end.

*Lexicon* by Max Barry is about a girl who attends a school for powered individuals but discovers controversy and conspiracy. Has some moments of a big looming supernatural feeling threat and some legitimately scary adventure moments.

*Recursion* by Blake Crouch is a popular book here because it's a trippy time/dimension hopping adventure. Only thing I've read that's quite like it is another one of this author's books *Dark Matter.*

*Bunny* by Mona Awad is a ride and pretty eff'd up. There is a creepy layer of ""what's going on here"" through most of it. Very trippy and at the end it's fun to try and figure out what it was that was actually happening. Not extreme as so much disturbing and bizarre.

*Mexican Gothic* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia is a creepy book, but stops just short of being truly scary. A young woman goes to visit her ill cousin who lives in a colonial mansion. Weirdness starts happening and she's determined to find answers.

*The Hollow Places* and *The Twisted Ones* by T. Kingfisher are unsettling and creepy books, but delivered in a casual and qwirky self aware YA style that keeps it from being downright scary.

*Battle Royale* is a controversial political book that arguably inspired *Hunger Games.*

*Blackfish City* is an interesting take on dystopia.  Post climate disaster, a huge floating city filled with classism doesn't know what to do when rumors of a mysterious woman riding a killer whale starts circulating.  Some cool moments and inspired by Inuit fokelore. 

*Follow Me to Ground* by Sue Rainsford is a creepy but poetic novella. A bit disturbing, but in a medical sense. I loved this little book and couldn't put it down."

9230,nzsawr,6,"Necroscope. 

Ok, so when people die, they actually just go into a mental prison, of sorts. Their mind lives on, in perpetuity. They are undisturbed and free to pursue their passions forever. I.e. the best bridge builder would have designed bridges spanning oceans. Beethoven has written the most amazing symphonies. ETC ETC. 

Now, enter the one man who can communicate with them! He can tap into the wealth of hidden human knowledge. And, once released from their mind prisons, the dead have someone to talk to again! They love him. 

So he learns all of these amazing things and becomes a champion for the voices of the dead. Need to fight? Let Bruce Lee teach guide your mind via martial arts. Need to dance? Where's Michael Jackson? Need to ace that math test? Boom, Isaac Newton is happy to help. Cool, right?

But wait, there's more! Turns out, there are a lot of people who have ESP powers... telepaths, future-readers, human lie detectors, etc. But only one guy who can talk to the dead. 

Now, if there are a lot of people like that, then it only makes sense the government would recruit them... and use them as SPIES. So now global espionage is extra cool, because there are telepaths and people who can predict the future. 

And, so then, we're set during the height of the Cold War. And the Russians are super-evil. Evil, psychic spying, etc. Awesome, right?!

Now. Throw in some vampires, alien planets, werewolves and gypsies vampire hunters and you have one BADASS series. 

(you did, indeed, read that last sentence correctly)."

9232,nzsawr,3,"China Mieville in general. I've read three of his books and in order of my preference: Embassytown, The City and The City, The Censustaker. 

They are so weird. I'm still not sure what happened in The City and the City. Embassytown is somewhat straightforward because it follows a human character, but she gets wrapped up in very weird alien culture/conflict."
9233,nzsawr,3,"The Unwind series by Neal Shusterman. The premise is that parents can have their children retroactively aborted (unwound) between 13 and 18 years old. The child's body is completely taken apart and each part re-used in other humans. The first book is a fine standalone if you're not into series. 

A Brief History of the Dead by Kevin Brockmeier. The premise is that there is a city of the dead that lies between life and... whatever is next. The dead stay there for as long as there is a living person who remembers them. When a pandemic hits, the city begins to empty."
9234,nzsawr,4,"Murakami usually hits the spot with odd ass premises.

John Dies in the End (the series) by David Wong -- I enjoyed it a while back. Stuck with me, but never really wanted to re-read.

Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky -- Recently read this one. The style and the concept was just really odd to me. Really, enjoyable though."
9235,nzwgfb,17,"Ur not alone! I know how u feel cuz the same thing happened to me, but maybe worse.  
I’ve gained too much weight (even more than my first year of college…lol)  
I drink too much (can anyone say, “party of one!”)  
I feel like I’m on a mental rollercoaster, constantly feeling up then down.  
After some close examination, I decided I needed help so I talked to my mom because she’s always positive.  
She said her morning routine is what keeps her sane and day on track. She says she writes in a journal, follows positive affirmations and meditates.  
This sounded overwhelming so I started with small steps.  
I found this new book, it’s a freebie!  
It teaches positive affirmations and how you can develop ur morning routine.  
At first I wasn’t a believer in self-talk. I felt weird talking out loud to myself, but you know what?  
After a week I got used to it and started noticing a difference. I can’t say that I’m back in control yet or that I’m performing miracles regularly! But it’s only been a week and I’m feeling better and am more positive. Even my mom noticed!  
Unlike a lot of freebie ebooks, this one was actually pretty good. It provided examples in 5 areas of your life – love, abundance, appreciation, health and success.  
It’s not the end to all your problems or even a cure, but I was able to start practicing the first day so I would say this is more of an exercise book.  
It’s free so what do you have to lose? &gt;&gt;&gt; https://track.conquerlife.net/reddit"
9236,nzwgfb,3,"I know a lot of people who could use a “lift me up” because of the pandamic. Many of my co-workers who were forced to work from home liked it in the beginning but anyone who has worked from home for a long time understands that eventually you will feel like you’re a hostage if you don’t take care of your mental health.  
self-talk can be your best friend or worse enemy  
I listen to my inner voice, but I need positive vibes if it want it to be my best friend. So, affirmations do work if you learn how to use them. most people will try it for a day or two and because they don’t like to talking out loud they think it’s rubbish.  
The key to affirmations is that you have to stick with it and practice. Yes, the morning is your best chance to make your day great, but if you’re not taking any time for yourself then you are leaving your day to chance.  
I started using affirmations when I was a teenager because I was tired of being bullied or people making fun of me, like my appearance or clothing I wore. Today, I have self confidence that I know wouldn’t be right if I didn’t use affirmations everyday.  
People say it feels fake and in the beginning it does because you don’t know anything else. But if you stick with it, I promise it’s real.  
No, saying, “I’ll win the lottery today!” won’t happen or make you rich, but applying affirmations in the right way will build your confidence and you will have a healthier mental state.  
That’s my two cents!"
9237,nzwgfb,20,How to do nothing by Jenny Odell. I know it sounds counter productive but you'll see
9238,nzwgfb,45,"For me I’ve found books that teach an actual skill help a lot. Something that can be performed, like a hobby or neat trick. I would recommend Unlimited Memory by Kevin Horsley and/or Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer. Both books teach the practice of building memory techniques and I’ve found both were motivating in other aspects without being outright a motivational book. As with any skill or hobby you need to be in a disciplined and focused mindset. I think these books are incredible for this and can really get you out of a rut. 

I know this seems to veer off from your point quite drastically but your statements really resonated with me (I also can’t stand rah-rah or fluffy self help books) and these were the books that I felt really helped me when I was feeling similar things. And if nothing else, it never fails to impress people when you can memorize an entire deck of cards. I wish you the best!"

I'm currently reading 'Blood in, Blood Out' which is a story about the Aryan Brotherhood. It's fascinating to realise just how insane some people's lives are. For me, when I started struggling with my mental health during lockdown, I found certain books like that helpful. They allowed me to disconnect and be thankful for the life I have, even when it was limited, because it could always be tragically worse.

The best quote from this book is that everyone wants to be rich or fit, but only a small percentage of people choose to do what it takes. 

For me, this book gives actionable steps to start waking up earlier to exercise, read, etc. it’s not some bull shot about thinking positive or other shit. It’s as simple as deciding when you want to do something and doing it. It gives tips on how to wake up without hitting the snooze a bunch of times. Even if you don’t wake up earlier, it can still help you get more focused and get a set routine."

Best when accompanied by attending a program facilitated by a DBT trained clinician, but if you've done much self help you'll find many of the concepts contained within are not novel.

9258,nzwgfb,45,"It really is a good book. The thing I've realized more and more as I have gotten older is there's a pretty small difference between feeling good about things and feeling bad about things. When I'm really busy and stressed, often all it takes is getting rid of like 5% of my load to make it allseem perfectly manageable. The same logic works on almost everything, if you can make something 5% better, or easier, or more fun, it might take it from the ""bad"" category in your mind to the ""good"" category in your mind. And if you can move even just a few things you need to do into the good category, it might take your whole life into the good category."

&gt;Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

&gt;In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

&gt;The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

&gt;From the bestselling author of The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry and So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed.
&gt;
&gt;A wide variety of extremist groups -- Islamic fundamentalists, neo-Nazis -- share the oddly similar belief that a tiny shadowy elite rule the world from a secret room. In Them, journalist Jon Ronson has joined the extremists to track down the fabled secret room.
&gt;
&gt;As a journalist and a Jew, Ronson was often considered one of ""Them"" but he had no idea if their meetings actually took place. Was he just not invited? Them takes us across three continents and into the secret room. Along the way he meets Omar Bakri Mohammed, considered one of the most dangerous men in Great Britain, PR-savvy Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Thom Robb, and the survivors of Ruby Ridge. He is chased by men in dark glasses and unmasked as a Jew in the middle of a Jihad training camp. In the forests of northern California he even witnesses CEOs and leading politicians -- like Dick Cheney and George Bush -- undertake a bizarre owl ritual.
&gt;
&gt;Ronson's investigations, by turns creepy and comical, reveal some alarming things about the looking-glass world of ""us"" and ""them."" Them is a deep and fascinating look at the lives and minds of extremists. Are the extremists onto something? Or is Jon Ronson becoming one of them?

&gt;What makes people love and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name? While many studies have been written on nationalist political movements, the sense of nationality--the personal and cultural feeling of belonging to a nation--has not received proportionate attention. In this widely acclaimed work, Benedict Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the 'imagined communities' of nationality.
&gt;
&gt;Anderson explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kingship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of vernacular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was modularly adopted by popular movements in Europe, by the imperialist powers, and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa.
&gt;
&gt;This revised edition includes two new chapters, one of which discusses the complex role of the colonialist state's mindset in the develpment of Third World nationalism, while the other analyses the processes by which, all over the world, nations came to imagine themselves as old.

An excerpt:

Now more than ever, most journalists work for giant nihilistic corporations whose editorial decisions are skewed by a toxic mix of political and financial considerations. Unless you understand how those pressures work, it’s very difficult for a casual news consumer to gain an accurate picture of the world.

This book is intended as an insider’s guide to those distortions.

The technology underpinning the modern news business is sophisticated and works according to a two-step process. First, it creates content that reinforces your pre-existing opinions, and after analysis of your consumer habits, sends it to you.

Then it matches you to advertisers who have a product they’re trying to sell to your demographic. This is how companies like Facebook and Google make their money: telling advertisers where their likely customers are on the web.

The news, basically, is bait to lure you in to a pen where you can be sold sneakers or bath soaps or prostatitis cures or whatever else studies say people of your age, gender, race, class, and political bent tend to buy.

Imagine your Internet surfing habit as being like walking down a street. A man shouts: “Did you hear what those damned liberals did today? Come down this alley.”

You hate liberals, so you go down the alley. On your way to the story, there’s a storefront selling mart carts and gold investments (there’s a crash coming – this billionaire even says so!).

Maybe you buy the gold, maybe you don’t. But at the end of the alley, there’s a red-faced screamer telling a story that may even be true, about a college in Massachusetts where administrators took down a statue of John Adams because it made a Hispanic immigrant “uncomfortable.” Boy does that make you pissed!

They picked that story just for you to hear. It is like the parable of Kafka’s gatekeeper, guarding a door to the truth that was built just for you.

Across the street, down the MSNBC alley, there’s an opposite story, and set of storefronts, built specifically for someone else to hear.

People need to start understanding the news not as “the news,” but as just such an individualized consumer experience – anger just for you.

This is not reporting. It’s a marketing process designed to create rhetorical addictions and shut unhelpfully non-consumerist doors in your mind. This creates more than just pockets of political rancor. It creates masses of media consumers who’ve been trained to see in only one direction, as if they had been pulled through history on a railroad track, with heads fastened in blinders, looking only one way.

As it turns out, there is a utility in keeping us divided. As people, the more separate we are, the more politically impotent we become.

This is the second stage of the mass media deception originally described in Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman’s book Manufacturing Consent.

First, we’re taught to stay within certain bounds, intellectually. Then, we’re all herded into separate demographic pens, located along different patches of real estate on the spectrum of permissible thought.

Once safely captured, we’re trained to consume the news the way sports fans do. We root for our team, and hate all the rest.

Hatred is the partner of ignorance, and we in the media have become experts in selling both.
I looked back at thirty years of deceptive episodes – from Iraq to the financial crisis of 2008 to the 2016 election of Donald Trump – and found that we in the press have increasingly used intramural hatreds to obscure larger, more damning truths. Fake controversies of increasing absurdity have been deployed over and over to keep our audiences from seeing larger problems.

We manufactured fake dissent, to prevent real dissent.

9360,o0bwrr,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb made a name for himself by rebutting Pinker's methodology. He has partnered with academics and published two scientific studies to do so. [This article explains further](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/21/8635369/pinker-taleb). The gist of the argument goes:

""Taleb and Cirillo conclude that there are two major flaws in Pinker's theory. The first is that their analysis suggests huge conflicts (on the scale of 10 million casualties) only happen once a century, but Pinker's ""long peace"" only covers 70 years. That could mean that what looks like a decline in violent conflict is merely a gap between major wars.

They also conclude that Pinker has underestimated the actual average casualty numbers in major wars by about three times, and that the real numbers don't actually show a decline over time. If that's right, his measurements of the apparent decline of war are overly rosy.""

I'm not a statistician by trade so I can't make a authoritative judgement, but it certainly puts Pinker's thesis in a bad light."

9375,o0bwrr,3,"Gun Control in the Third Reich by Stephen Halbrook.

MAYBE.

The reason and the seemingly underlying concept behind the book... I'll try to be clear... was that the definition of ""US vs THEM vs OTHER"" was defined as such initially.

But given enough time. As the initial ""US"" gained power and influence along all dimensions (political, philosophical, moral, media, physical power) the nature of ""THEM"" becomes ever expansive, until the ""THEM"" also included ""OTHER or EVERYONE ELSE."" And over time, piece by piece, ""OTHER or EVERYONE ELSE"" slowly became ""THEM"" along some kind of analysis or discrimination.

The eventuality became that the ""US"" became whomever wielded the most influence and could control the definition. And this ""NEW-US"" could classify individuals, families and groups, who were ""OLD-US"" under the prior definition and mark these people as a ""THEM"" for any subjective reasons or whims that the ""NEW-US"" deems. 

Any whoo. Any serious exploration of 20th century atrocities will clue you into this concept."

9397,o0hwru,3,"I read both Carrie and Pet Semetary when I was 11 or 12 so those may be great ones to start with. Carrie especially may be a good since it’s not very long, you can get a feel for his writing."
9398,o0hwru,12,"The Shining and Salems Lot would be a good place to start. Those were the first 2 that I read by King. 

Different Seasons is good too, it contains 4 novellas, 2 of which were made into very good films. The Shawshank Redemption and The Body (which was made into Stand by Me)."
9399,o0hwru,24,"Stephen King writes at an easy to intermediate level, you should be fine."

Raymond E. Feist's Magician series (and riftwar saga) is right up your alley.

9429,o0s3kt,3,The chronicles of Amber  Roger Zelazny.
9430,o0s3kt,8,"I second this - Wheel of Time is a pretty big one. The first book has some huge callbacks to LoTR. The entire series is full of what you'd probably consider ""quests"". The world is huge, with tons of different and well developed cultures and peoples. Robert Jordans writing is very comparable to Tolkien's in it's use of description to really paint a picture of the world and it's people - though Jordan focuses on clothing descriptions more than I remember Tolkien doing. Not only is the world big, but it has a rich and mysterious history that you learn pieces of as the characters learn more, but it is done in very interesting ways.

Overall, it's this sprawling good vs evil story that is definitely worth trying out. And the series is complete, so no waiting for the next book to come out. I'm currently doing a reread and  picking up on world building details that I missed in the first read-through.

Lastly, a tv show is in development at Amazon, so you could hop on at just the right time to have a TV show that probably won't do it justice!"

The characters blow me away every time. Honestly I can't even pick a top 5 because they are all relatable and well written (which speaking as a 30F, it's been hard to find decent female protagonists/MCs especially when the author is not female)."

And it was before Titus met Violet, a beautiful, brainy teenage girl who has decided to fight the feed and its ever-present ability to categorize human thoughts and desires. M. T. Anderson’s not-so-brave new world is a smart, savage satire that has captivated readers with its view of an imagined future that veers unnervingly close to the here and now"

&gt;Based on the iconic novel by George Orwell, 1984 brings us the story of Winston Smith, a cog in the giant machine state of Oceania. Physically and mentally under the omnipresent eye of Big Brother, Winston has been caught struggling for scraps of love and freedom in a world awash with distrust and violence. With the brutal ""help"" of four Party Members, Winston is forced to confess his Thoughtcrimes before an unseen inquisitor, and the audience -- which acts as a silent witness to his torture. A ferocious and provocative adaptation of one of the most prescient works of literature of the last century.

Also I'm reading The Iron Heel by Jack London for the 2nd time, which is an incredible dystopian novel. From what I've heard it was the first dystopia novel and heavily influenced Orwell. I don't know why it's not brought up more like 1984 is, considering it's probably closer to our current society than 1984 was, even though it was written over a 100 years ago."

&gt;
&gt;  What if the whole world were a dead, blasted wasteland?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Mistborn
&gt;For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the ""Sliver of Infinity,"" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier ""snapped"" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.
&gt;
&gt;Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.
&gt;
&gt;But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.
&gt;
&gt;Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale-spinner and author of the acclaimed debut Elantris, dares to turns a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the prophesied hero failed to defeat the Dark Lord? The answer will be found in the Misborn Trilogy, a saga of surprises that begins with the book in your hands. Fantasy will never be the same again.

The civilized world descends into chaos and a dystopian way of life replaces it. Her story is sad, exciting, rebellious, and INCREDIBLY funny all at the same time.

9535,o0w9cq,4,Came here to recommend this! One of my FAVORITE series!
9536,o0w9cq,9,"Like all the others, I second and third and forth (lol) Red Rising, lol."
9537,o0w9cq,4,I loved the first book. The second book just drags and I haven't been able to finish it yet. Is the third book more like the first or second with how fast you can read it? I like the idea of the story of the second book. It just isn't drawing me in like the first.
9538,o0w9cq,3,"Fahrenheit 451 was awesome for me, but it’s not directly about teenagers"
9539,o0w9cq,3,Mortal instruments by cassandra clare
9540,o0w9cq,4,"Oh, my sweet summer child. Look into the classics: 1984, A Clockwork Orange, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, The Giver (series). There are so many that are so good - this was my favorite genre back in school."
9541,o0w9cq,4,"This Perfect Day by Ira Levin.

Edit: spelling an author addition"
9542,o0w9cq,3,"Currently reading “a brave new world” by aldous huxley and it’s pretty damn dystopian. not sure if it fits that trope bc i haven’t finished it yet .

“player piano” but kurt vonnegut is a depressing dystopian book that has some of the qualities you’re looking for (no teen protagonist tho)"
9543,o0w9cq,5,"Such a fun book, particularly the first in the series, it’s one of those perfect summer reads."
9544,o0w9cq,4,This was gonna be my suggestion as well!
9545,o0w9cq,4,I found the third book picked back up again
9546,o0w9cq,5,I think you need to add some Ender's Game and Gattaca in there too
9547,o0w9cq,3,Shadow and Bone series by Leigh Bardugo fits most of these criteria! I’m reading it now and enjoying it!
9548,o0w9cq,3,"Not really YA but check out the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons. It is about a future where humanity has multiple star systems but it's ruled by a hegemony government and lots of fun stuff to do with time, reality and gods."
9549,o0w9cq,3,Station 11 was excellent. Weaves together a gripping story of multiple characters post and pre pandemic that kills off a majority of the population. Highly recommend.
9550,o0w9cq,3,"The Chrysalids by John Wyndham

The Handmaid's Tale

The Giver

1984 (although you've probably already read it)

Brave New World

Farenheit 451

These are all a bit more mature, less teen-movie books but still great dystopian stories where a small group is against the broader world.  Just no 'i have to choose between these two boys who love me and our love will save the world'. Not that there's anything wrong with a fun YA trope!"
9551,o0w9cq,5,"If you're looking for more matured ones: 


- 1984: most classic from the genre
- Brave New World: most interesting with big worldbuilding (the best piece imo)
- We: first dystopian book, kind of like Brave New World but not as good
- Anthem (by Ayn Rand): quite short, easy to understand but still interesting
- Fahrenheit 451: not as well written as the others, but it has a good premise and it's a good starter"

Other ones people like but I agree: red rising by Pierce Brown (I found this one really frustrating because it relies on the trope of showing us a man is bad by having him rape woman. It’s done in a fetishy way and the lead is a Mary Sue. So ya I don’t recommend it but I’m sure lots of people will). Unwind by Neal Shusterman (this is completely anti abortion propaganda and rubbed me the wrong way) and Sycthe by Neil shusterman (I actually relatively enjoyed this one, just not as much as others).

&gt;Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, VOX is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.
&gt;
&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.
&gt;
&gt;This is just the beginning.
&gt;
&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.
&gt;
&gt;But this is not the end.
&gt;
&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.

&gt;Elena Fairchild is a teacher at one of the state’s new elite schools. Her daughters are exactly like her: beautiful, ambitious, and perfect. A good thing, since the recent mandate that’s swept the country is all about perfection.
&gt; 
&gt;Now everyone must undergo routine tests for their quotient, Q, and any children who don’t measure up are placed into new government schools. Instead, teachers can focus on the gifted.
&gt; 
&gt;Elena tells herself it’s not about eugenics, not really, but when one of her daughters scores lower than expected and is taken away, she intentionally fails her own test to go with her.
&gt; 
&gt;But what Elena discovers is far more terrifying than she ever imagined…

&gt;Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now . . . 
&gt;
&gt;Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force.

9574,o12q1r,5,"There are a bunch of books written by Leslie Patricelli aimed at this age group (mostly 1-2 years). Books have titles like HUGGY KISSY, BABY HAPPY BABY SAD, POTTY, etc. and have stories that infants can follow. These books are hardbound therefore can take more than a few tumbles and spills. I also recommend Mr. Men series by Roger Hargreaves, but these are on regular paper (therefore not exactly baby proof). My daughter loved both."
9575,o12q1r,5,"This is the perfect book for a child who likes books: Once Upon a Time, The End by Barry Blitt. In the book the author plays with conventional stories like the three little pigs (it becomes two little pigs to cut out the fat). The idea is the dad is trying to get the children to go to sleep faster. But of course children memorize archetypal stories and know that something playful is going on. It opens up the idea that stories are created and they can play at this too. 

I’ve given it as a gift a few times and it is always a hit."
9576,o12q1r,4,"We are avid readers and read lots of books to our two kids (3 and 6 yo)!! The key thing is to repeat books for kids over and over again as it is how they learn. We also occasionally read simple lines from poems or songs with them as well.

My recommendations are below! 

Anything by Mem Fox is good for this age group!

The gruffalo series

Where the wild things are: probably more suitable for 2-3yo ish. My son adores this book!

Goodnight moon - our copy is so worn after reading it nightly for my 2 young kids. The rhythm is great for their language development

Other classics include books by Eric Carle or Alison Lester (her Kiss by the moon is my favourite)"

Love you Forever

Farmer Joe’s Hot Day

Kids love anything by Sandra Boynton (ex. ""Moo, Baaa, la,la,la"")  or by Robert Munsch (ex. ""Mud Puddle"" or ""I have to Go"")

9603,o13oo2,16,"If you are interested in poetry, I was thinking of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, but that text was edited so much in the translation process by Edward (?) FitzGerald that one can almost consider it an English fantasy of what the Golden Age Islamic world/literature was so idk if it's a good recommendation. 
(If anybody knows if, and if yes where, I can get a version that's truer to what Omar Khayyam himself wrote, I would be interested)

Again poetry: Rumi. I haven't read any of his poetry, but I did once listen to an event about poetry where the author of ""The Poetry Pharmacy"" was present, and he read a poem of his which was great."
9604,o13oo2,50,"The best match to Plato’s The Republic is The Book of Government from Nizamulmulk. Any book of Avorrees and Muqaddimah of Ibn Khaldun are good reads of thoughts on government and society.

The Masnavi from Rumi and Divan of Yunus Emre is one of the well-known philosophical books.

If you want to read sth recent on this topic. Lost Enlightenment from Frederic Starr, and Venture of Islam from Marshall Hodgson are excellent readings

Btw these are the first ones that dropped to my mind. If you have any questions about some other sources, I can try to answer"
9605,o13oo2,85,"I’ve been trying forever to find some accessible publications, so far in English it seems like they’re mostly aimed at academics and are quite expensive, anyhow:

The philosopher they obsessed over primarily is Aristotle, pre-Ibn Sina the bulk of Arab philosophy was dedicated to commentaries on Aristotle. In this regard we have al-Farabi (there are commentaries on Logic I could find, apparently only after reading his commentary on Metaphysics did ibn-Sina understand it) and al-Kindi, and much later in Spain, Averroes (AKA ibn-Rushd). These guys wrote extensive commentaries on the Greeks with a lot of original thought that could be of your interest. 

The most influential, arguably, is ibn-Sina, he has a short autobiography that I would recommend first. His major undertaking is called “Book of the Healing” that laid out his entire system, a lot of things in it, ie Proof of the Truthful, laid the foundation for things like the Contingency Argument. The other giant would be al-Ghazali, major dude on Jurisprudence and somewhat despised the over-fetishisation of the Greeks, his major undertaking is called “Incoherence of the Philosophers,” (which I found too difficult to read, and I’ve gone through some stuff...). The aforementioned Averroes, being a traditionalist who worshipped Aristotle, responded with “Incoherence of the Incoherence.” 

Two philosophical novels come to mind, structurally similar to More’s Utopia or Nietzsche’s Zarathustra in the Western tradition: Theologus Autodidactus (The Self-Taught Theologian, probably spelt it wrong) and Hayy ibn Yaqzan (Alive, Son of Awake). Both feral child stories, and works on the idea of prior knowledge and how one attains ideas from nothings, the former more focused on theology."
9606,o13oo2,33,"""The introduction"" by Ibn Khaldun. One of the earliest books about history and sociology. 

""The epistle of forgiveness"" by Al Mua'arri (fun fact it is like the Islamic version of the divine comedy except that it was written before the divine comedy). 

If you are looking for arabic poetry then the best pre islamic pieces of literature in Arabia are ""the seven golden odes of Arabia: The Mu'allaqat"".


EDIT: also wanted to add ""the compendious book on calculation by completion and balancing"" by Al Khwarizmi (btw the word algorithm comes from his name. And Algebra is the arabic word for completion)"
9607,o13oo2,6,"The introduction by Ibn Khaldon, considered one of the leading thinkers in sociology and philosophy"
9608,o13oo2,51,"With Middle Eastern and Islamic texts, it's important to thoroughly vet the translator lest we have a Rumi situation. Orientalist takes may seem harmless on the surface but it can erase a lot of identity, history, context, meaning and general agency of its source material. 

That being said, Ibn Khaldun is a sure-fire pick for great classical texts as is Ibn Battuta (though he's focus is more on travel et al)"

9628,o13oo2,5,"There are a few philosophical works that may appeal:

- Conference of the Birds by Attar

- Theologus Autodidactus by al-Nafis

If you're up for stream of conscious or free form non-fiction, travelogues written by Arab historians are great. Ibn Battuta, Ibn Fadlan, and Ibn Jubayr are some such writers. 

Another option. NYU publishes a series, Library of Arabic Literature, with a dizzying selection of texts. Happy reading!"
9629,o13oo2,4,"I probably didn't word this in the best way. Basically, she reads Persian and therefore Rumi in its original language and she still can't make sense of it due to its metaphysical/spiritual imagery and examples."
9630,o13oo2,3,"The divan of hafiz will definitely fascinate you. Hafiz was a sufi poet from shiraz.
Then I’d definitely advise you to look for the tutinameh, a collection of tales that the 1001 tales were modelled after. 
Then you could try to find hayy bin yakzan by Ibn Tufeyl.. I’m not sure if there is an english translation of this book, but it is a philosophical narrative disguised as a robinson crusoe tale centuries before robinson crusoe…
Yet the quintessential Golden Age character of the Islamic age is most definitely Ibn Arabi… 
He has written hundreds of books, yet not many have been translated. In any case, anything he wrote is worth lookinh into… moroever, I’d recommend western scholars works on Arabi, like Claude Addas’ Arabi biography, “The Quest for The Red Sulphur”
Henry Corbin is an incredibly important French scholar who wrote extensively on Ibn Arabi… anything he wrote will be amazing, guranteed…
That being said, here are the names of a few contemporary scholars whose critical work might be interesting to read for you: seyyid hussein ben nasr, william chittick, freidoune binislama (not really sure of this last name, imight be recalling it wrongly-this guy wrote an incredible book on the psychoanalysis of islam)"

&gt;Lilith Iyapo has just lost her husband and son when atomic fire consumes Earth—the last stage of the planet’s final war. Hundreds of years later Lilith awakes, deep in the hold of a massive alien spacecraft piloted by the Oankali—who arrived just in time to save humanity from extinction. They have kept Lilith and other survivors asleep for centuries, as they learned whatever they could about Earth. Now it is time for Lilith to lead them back to her home world, but life among the Oankali on the newly resettled planet will be nothing like it was before.
&gt;
&gt;The Oankali survive by genetically merging with primitive civilizations—whether their new hosts like it or not. For the first time since the nuclear holocaust, Earth will be inhabited. Grass will grow, animals will run, and people will learn to survive the planet’s untamed wilderness. But their children will not be human. Not exactly.

Tamsin Muir - Gideon the Ninth

All very good modern sci-fi (and many of them are the first in a series)! I've not listed them in any particular order, and each is very different, but if you want a more accessible starting point I'd recommend going for Becky Chambers."

* Martha Wells

Janny Wurts

Margaret Weis (usually writes with Hickman)"
9655,o1d9we,33,This right here.  The Ancillary series and MurderBot series are two of the BEST current SFF series.
9656,o1d9we,4,"Try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander Series.   


I think there are currently eight books in the series. The main character is very clearly an adult woman - no silly teenager bs,  and the storyline is really interesting.   


I read the first I think four books, then I got busy and I haven't had a chance to get back to it.   


The first couple books are particularly racy, too. If you're into that kind of thing.

EDIT:  TW for sexual assault"
9657,o1d9we,10,"I’m here to second Connie Wallis and Ursula Le Guin, and to add An Unkindness of Ghosts by Rivers Solomon. The last one isn’t great, but it’s unique in my experience: slaves in space. ETA: I will delete the last part of my comment if people think I should. I just remembered that I’m pretty sure Rivers Solomon is non-binary."
9658,o1d9we,18,Anything I’ve ever read by Octavia Butler definitely I’d count as sci-fi not meant for kids.
9659,o1d9we,5,"Here are just some of my favorite female  authors.  

1.  Marion Zimmer Bradley.  Best known for MISTS OF AVALON and THE DARK OVER SERIES.

2.  Anne Mccaffrey.  Best known for the DRAGONRIDES OF PERN series.

3.  C. J. Cherryh.  She has written more than 70 sci-fi/fantasy books.

4.  Ursula Le Guin.  Best known for THE EARTHSEA series.  

5.  Andre Norton.  She has written more than 300 books.

     There are years of reading here."

9663,o1d9we,5,"Andre Norton I found out was a female SciFi 
writer. 

Martha Wells: MurderBot Diaries

N.K. Jemison, lil bit more on the fantasy side.

Octavia E. Butler. The. BEST. EVER. 

Amal El-Mohar: This is how you lose the time war."
9664,o1d9we,7,"Piranesi was mentioned already, but Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell would also definitely fit.

Similarly the Temeraire series by Naomi Novik is another great fantasy-alternate history story."
9665,o1d9we,17,Robin Hobb for sure!  I'd start with Soldier's son trilogy or Farseer Trilogy.
9666,o1d9we,3,I adored Hellspark by Janet Kagan.  1980s First Contact sci fi focused on the challenges of interplanetary/intercultural communication.
9667,o1d9we,11,I loved Piranesi :)
9668,o1d9we,10,"The Daevabad Trilogy is so great and different.

An Ember in the Ashes series is sometimes regarded as YA, but I never really felt that way. Maybe the first book more so?"
9669,o1d9we,59,I’m shook. All of these are books I’ve read in the last year or so. All of them are deeply loved by me. Piranesi  and this is how you lose the time war deserve elevated special recommendations. This is a lovely list.
9670,o1d9we,11,Grass by Sheri Tepper

What makes that choice for you? Genuinely curious, not attacking."
9675,o1d9we,6,"Both solid choices. I envy anyone that gets to start the Farseer Trilogy, much less the greater Realm it's part of, for the first time."
9676,o1d9we,9,Ann McCaffery or Mercedes Lackey somewhere around 1000 books between them.
9677,o1d9we,5,Came here to recommend both Cherryh and McCaffrey. I particularly like McCaffrey’s *Crystal Singer* and *Brain Ships* series.
9678,o1d9we,21,"The Temeraire series by Naomi Novik-- if Anne McCaffery and Patrick O'Brian wrote a series together this would be it. The Napoleonic wars, epic battles at sea...with dragons as air support. The first three are the best.

And the Enchantment Emporium trilogy by Tanya Huff, and her Blood books series, and her Valor series. Let's just say it's hard to go wrong with her books~~.~~"

9682,o1d9we,4,"Connie Willis ( all are so good!), Kage Baker (time travel but very scientific) , Jodi Taylor (the Chronicles of St. Mary'sis about the study of history in contemporary time.  the new Loki show really reminds me of these books).  Anne McCaffrey (dragon Riders of Pern were favorites).  Mercedise Lackey (some really good fantasy things).  Older Barbara Hambly (the Sun Horse and Star Hawk books are swords and horses, The Windrose Chronicles late 20th century programmer gets transported to another realm that has magic, James Asher books are vampires,  The Benjamin January novels are more historical fiction).  Laurell K Wilson's early books (unless you are into pages and pages of sex scenes and realize the story itself was only one chapter.  the other 30 are sex).  Seanan McGuire (The Incryptid series is modern day family tries to protect magical species from bad guys, October Daye Series is modern woman PI somehow gets stuck with doing things with the Fae, Girl in the green silk dress is ghost stories and ties back into the Incryptid series a little.

Naomi Novik and the Temeraire series is decidedly NOT teen."
9694,o1d9we,7,{{The Priory of the Orange Tree}}
9695,o1d9we,18,LOL yes she was!  She intentionally chose a somewhat androgynous pseudonym since women weren’t accepted as SFF authors back then.
9696,o1d9we,14,Several books by Octavia Butler fall under the science fiction category. I've enjoyed all of her works but {{Parable of the Sower}} is especially fantastic!

9709,o1d9we,4,Frankenstein
9710,o1d9we,4,"The parasol protectorate series by Gail Carriger is a favorite of mine. It’s light and fluffy steam punk but with vampires and werewolves. 

Also the innkeeper series by Ilona Andrews is fun urban fantasy."
9711,o1d9we,5,"There’s so many recommendations here that I’m sure some of these might already be mentioned, but here’s the ones that came to mind for me: 

The Witch’s Heart by Genevieve Gornichec 

The Year of the Witching by Alexis Henderson 

The Bone Witch by Rin Chupeco 

(can you tell I like witches?) 

Uprooted and Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik

Queens of Innis Lear by Tessa Gratton

Daughters of the Storm by Kim Wilkins 

I also have a lot of historical fiction books with fantasy elements. Like witches in New York and what not. So if that’s something worth putting down, I can add more books too."
9712,o1d9we,6,"I mean, sure? I'm always down to share my love for queer, POC and just weird speculative fiction! I really do believe that people who have had interesting life experiences write the most interesting stories."

9715,o1d9we,5,Same! I started to get excited that I might be the first to mention her!
9716,o1d9we,3,Fantasy series The Sevenwaters by Juliet Marillier
9717,o1d9we,3,"A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet. I haven't felt so hopeful for humanity in a long time since reading it. It follows a group of ragtag workers who punch holes in space. Has found family, wlw characters, and themes of love and finding where you belong. Astounding worldbuilding too."
9718,o1d9we,15,Alllllllll the NK Jemisin! Read them allllllllll!
9719,o1d9we,4,"Tons of great recommendations here!
I just read {Black Sun} and would definitely recommend, fantasy based on pre-Columbian American civilizations. I also love {The Calculating Stars} and sequels, alternate history of the early space program."
9720,o1d9we,7,"Sheri S. Tepper is my favourite author ever, she wrote mostly SF, mysteries, and some horror. Here are some others that I didn't see come up in the feed yet:

James Tiptree Jr. (yes, he was actually a she) 

Elizabeth Bear and Sarah Monette write great stuff together and separately

Terri Windling

Patricia McKillip

Patricia Briggs

Nalo Hopkinson

Candace Jane Dorsey

Nicola Griffith"
9721,o1d9we,5,"I was scrolling to see who else would recommend Guin, immediately upvoted then read the last line and took it back"
9722,o1d9we,5,THAT joke was THE BEST! I can hardly wait for the third one to be published!
9723,o1d9we,11,"So making this list really made me realize two things: 1) how much outstanding YA sci-fi and fantasy I’ve read in the last few years, and 2) how many incredible women authors writing Adult that I’ve read as well. This is most of the Adult list that I’ve read in the last few years:

 - The Light Brigade by Kameron Hurley (sci-fi military time travel)
 - Gods of Jade and Shadow by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (Mexican myth inspired quest through 1920’s Mexico)
- Wayfarers Series by Becky Chambers (space sci-fi)
 - Temeraire Series by Naomi Novik (alt history fantasy with dragons)
 - Eathsea Series by Ursula K LeGuin (classic, genre-defining fantasy from the 70s) 
 - Priory of the Orange Tree (high fantasy with dragons, absolutely massive)
 - The Poppy War series by RF Kuang (absolutely brutal Chinese-inspired military fantasy, check your CW here)
 - A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine (diplomatic epic sci-fi, plays with politics, language, and identity)

Several of these have been rec’d by others already (which is great!) but I wanted to add my two cents worth."
9724,o1d9we,5,I second Becky Chambers. Just finished that book yesterday. It was an utter delight.
9725,o1d9we,3,"Oooh can I be book buddies with you too??
If you like queer, POC fiction, I recommend Tasha Suri's latest book! :)"
9726,o1d9we,3,Tanith Lee

9728,o1d9we,3,"just finished The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. It was a amazing sci fi I cannot recommend enough. not super plot heavy though, it’s more of a character driven read. but the characters are so vibrant and lovable that I enjoyed every moment of it"
9729,o1d9we,5,"I'm assuming you're also talking about &gt;!Left Grief!&lt;. I really hope that actually becomes plot relevant. I mean, you shouldn't be allowed to do that otherwise."
9730,o1d9we,3,"My absolute favourites right now would be The Daevabad Series by S. A. Chakraborty for Islamic folklore inspired adventures full of jinn and ifrit, Green Bone Saga by Fonda Lee for Oriental-Asian inspired magic gangsters and the Imperial Radch series by Ann Leckie for space robots."
9731,o1d9we,5,Anything by Margaret Atwood!
9732,o1d9we,4,Octavia Butler &amp; Ursula K. LeGuin
9733,o1d9we,23,She was a regular customer of mine when I worked in a bookshop/gaming store. I used to hunt down obscure books for her. Fascinating conversations.
9734,o1d9we,3,October Daye series by Seanan Mcguire..or anything by Seanan Mcguire. She's a great author.
9735,o1d9we,3,"I was hoping someone would mention Janny Wurts! Don't see her name pop up much, but I love The Wars of Light and Shadow series (which reminds me, I should pop over to her chat forum so see what the latest status update on the final book is!)."
9736,o1d9we,3,"The Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula K. LE Guin
It's part of the Haimish Cycle of book series.

Oryx and Crake trilogy by Margaret Atwood"
9737,o1d9we,5,"Mary Robinette Kowal: enough here to keep you busy for a while. Solid stories, solid research. I’ll read just about anything she writes."
9738,o1d9we,3,"You got several of the people I was going to recommend. I'll add Robin McKinley, Naomi Novik, V.E. Schwab, Patricia McKillip, and Silvia Moreno's Gods of Jade and Shadow on the fantasy end.

Edit - For V.E. Schwab, I've only read the Shades of Magic series. I know Addie LaRue is either highly recommended or poo-pooed in this sub. I remain neutral, as I have no input."
9739,o1d9we,6,"I second Broken Earth trilogy, all three won Hugo awards if I’m not mistaken…the first book is The Fifth Season, great series."
9740,o1d9we,17,"Checked out Piranesi from the library yesterday, I could not have been more happy with my luck in stumbling across it. As a lifelong avid reader that book is an amazing piece of literature, would recommend anyone in this thread to check it out."
9741,o1d9we,3,"Piranesi is absolutely incredible! Easily in my top 10 standalone novels. It isn’t really conventional sci-fi, though"
9742,o1d9we,6,"Second that whole series by Becky Chambers, especially the second book. Never thought I'd be able to empathize with an artificial intelligence."
9743,o1d9we,3,Octavia Butler and Ursula K LeGuin are two of my particular favorites! (Also saying this as someone who doesn’t really enjoy YA so take from that what you will.)
9744,o1d9we,3,"My favorite fantasy series of all time is by Marie Brennan: {{A natural history of dragons}}

And also {{The priory of the orange tree}} is something I can‘t recommend enough."

9761,o1d9we,3,"Anne leckie's Ancillary series was some of the most captivating, original sci Fi I've ever read"
9762,o1d9we,5,N. K. Jemison. I've just started one of her series as an audiobook. She's also a person of colour and a Psychologist which adds such a richness to the characters. I'm only a little way in but I think this woman needs a shout out for how quickly her book grabbed me!
9763,o1d9we,7,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula\_K.\_Le\_Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin) one of my favourite writers.
9764,o1d9we,4,it's probably been said many times already but literally Octavia Butler's entire body of work
9765,o1d9we,3,Octavia Butler!!!
9766,o1d9we,3,"Dragon Riders of Pern by Anne McCaffery

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonflight"
9767,o1d9we,3,"Not that I have read much by the authors but I am somewhat familiar with them and they are on my tbr. I work in a bookstore so I see a lot of cool stuff come in but never get to it unfortunately. 

Anne Mccaffrey- Dragonriders of Pern series but also other sci-fi and fantasy titles. Talent and the tower of hive, the crystal series. She was one of the first (if not the first) female winner of the Hugo I believe. 

C.S. Friedman- Coldfire trilogy (sword, magic fantasy) 

CJ Cherryh- she has lots of titles. Hugo winner for Downbelow station and cyteen. 

Gail Z. Martin has a cool series out that looks good called Chronicles of the necromancer. 

Margaret weis and Tracy Hickman have a lot of books that are set in the dragonlance game world if that’s something you’re in to as well. Weis was actually one of the original creators of the game itself, so that’s super cool. 

I’ve heard good things about Samantha Shannon’s priory of the orange tree as well. 

A coworker of mine is bonkers for anything Ursula K. Le Guin. She has quite a bit of sci-fi novels out there for sure. 

Other random names I can think of: 
Tanya Huff (dark fantasy/ horror-ish cool looking covers from what I remember) 
Octavia E. Butler 
Robin Hobb 
Diana Gabaldon (outlander series, super pop) 
Marion Zimmer Bradley (The mists of Avalon is very Arthurian legend/fantasy) 
Mercedes Lackey (protege of Bradley) 
Mary Stewart 

That’s all I can come up with from the top of my head. Hopefully it helps. Again, I haven’t read most of these unfortunately due to lack of time, but I’ve become familiar with a lot of these names and basically of these authors interest me. Maybe you’ll stumble across some things you like!"

9773,o1d9we,3,"The lady astronaut series, was really well done"
9774,o1f7i3,4,"Not a book unfortunately, but the movie Frances Ha is a friendship movie that deals with these themes."
9775,o1f7i3,3,I don’t have any recommendations but I would love to read a book with this theme!
9776,o1jvc9,7,"Maybe try Dean Koontz books. 

And maybe paranormal books like the Mercy Thompson series by Patricia Briggs."

9778,o1jvc9,6,"You could start with shorter ones like the long walk and the running man, then work your way to misery and the shining. Then finish up with the epics like It and the Stand. 

Then after that you’ll still have like 40+ more books!"

&gt;1990. The teen detectives once known as the Blyton Summer Detective Club (of Blyton Hills, a small mining town in the Zoinx River Valley in Oregon) are all grown up and haven't seen each other since their fateful, final case in 1977. Andy, the tomboy, is twenty-five and on the run, wanted in at least two states. Kerri, one-time kid genius and budding biologist, is bartending in New York, working on a serious drinking problem. At least she's got Tim, an excitable Weimaraner descended from the original canine member of the team. Nate, the horror nerd, has spent the last thirteen years in and out of mental health institutions, and currently resides in an asylum in Arhkam, Massachusetts. The only friend he still sees is Peter, the handsome jock turned movie star. The problem is, Peter's been dead for years.
&gt;
&gt;The time has come to uncover the source of their nightmares and return to where it all began in 1977. This time, it better not be a man in a mask. The real monsters are waiting.

9781,o1jvc9,3,"I know someone mentioned stephen king but I would say try his novella/short story collections.



 Additionally I would recommend Joe hills short story collections (He is stephen kings son). 

Anyway hope these help happy reading dude"
9782,o1jvc9,3,"Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft are two writers that come to mind for tales of the uncanny, the macabre and the supernatural."
9783,o1jvc9,3,Books of Blood by Clive Barker is prolly the best short horror collection ever written
9784,o1jvc9,3,Ray Bradbury.
9785,o1m2kw,5,"What do you like? When you watch movies/TV, what are your favourites? What are your interests?"
9786,o1m2kw,22,"Choose a book that you think sounds really fun and interesting. It will be completely individual so without knowing your tastes I’m not sure I can recommend any book in particular. 

Also, you don’t *have* to read fiction if you don’t enjoy it. There’s nothing inherently good or superior about being someone who reads novels. At the end of the day, read what you enjoy."
9787,o1m2kw,3,"Maybe start with some short stories first. Get an anthology with a bunch of writers and if you don’t like a story, bail and go to the next one. Have a ritual that you do with reading that you find relaxing. I smoke weed and make myself a cup of tea before I start reading. Though, to be fair, I do those two things before pretty much any leisure activity."
9788,o1m2kw,15,"Another way to segue is to read literary nonfiction-- history told in a novelistic way.  Pick a subject you are really interested in and find a book of that type on it: DARKEST HOUR by Anthony McCarten if it's WWII, IN COLD BLOOD by Truman Capote if you like crime, and so forth.  All the novels you listed are the kind I hate because the writing is crappy and it doesn't create that movie in your mind.  Or you might like stories in smaller bites, like Will Cuppy's THE DECLINE AND FALL OF PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY.  Or you might need something even funnier and faster-moving, like THE LONG, DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL by Douglas Adams.

I always follow the advice my 12th grade English teacher gave us: open a book that looks interesting and read the first page.  If it draws you in, keep reading.  If not, slam the book shut and choose something else."
9789,o1m2kw,5,"I have seen quite a lot of movies. I'd say there are few key categories

Science: 
Interstellar, Memento, Inception, Arrival, The Martian, The Matrix

I like it a lot when science is blended with philosophy. Matrix is has a lot of allegories to Plato's ideas. Arrival explores how does language shape someone's thought. 

History:
Hidden Figures, Gladiator, 1917, Saving Private Ryan, 

Anything that has an interesting untold story from history. 

Inspirational?

Lala Land (great cinematography) V for Vendetta, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty

This is a wide category but I really enjoy stories where characters pursue their purpose or seek new meaning to their lives

Thank you for following up with my post!"
9790,o1m2kw,3,"Ah thank you for sharing your advice. 

I should have added an additional section to my post to give a bit more background information!"
9791,o1m2kw,5,"You could try the book “The Martian” was based off of. It’s actually funnier than the movie in my opinion.

For philosophy interests, I would recommend John Green. In my opinion, he has the soul of a philosopher and use simple stories aimed at young adults to convey big, philosophical ideas."
9792,o1m2kw,3,Got it! Thank you
9793,o1m2kw,16,The Martian is a great book. Maybe reading something that you’ve already seen as a movie could help you learn to visualize while reading.
9794,o1m2kw,3,"Simple as finding a genre you like. 


Fantasy, sci-fi, war, horror, thriller. Whatever it is. Once it’s something you are into. The pages fly by. Nothing worse than being forced to read “classics” from a genre you have no interest in."
9795,o1m2kw,5,Have you tried audio books? Maybe listening to a fictional story is the bridge from movies/series to reading fiction for you? :-)
9796,o1m2kw,3,Try out Michael Crichton's books. He extensively researched the topics for his novels and often included a bibliography.
9797,o1m2kw,3,"Maybe try young adult novels. The good ones are written just as well as regular novels, but the category conventions are such that they are more tightly written."
9798,o1th3v,11,Ghost in the Wires or the Art of Intrusion by Kevin Mitnick are both pretty great! He’s a former hacker and the first book is a memoir discussing some of the things he did and how the government caught up to him. The second is others’ stories and a look into how they did what they did.
9799,o1th3v,3,"Daemon by Dan Suarez

Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson"
9800,o1th3v,3,Thank you for replying. That sounds exactly what I’m looking for and would be interesting to see it from a different POV.
9801,o1th3v,3,"Hey! I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity and have given lectures on certain topics, so I know of some more academic texts and resources. There was one book during my education that really stood out to me due to it being informative but still light (easy to comprehend). It was written by one of my professors and it was actually the only ""textbook"" I read from cover to cover. It reads more like a general nonfiction book than a textbook.

[Cybercrime and Digital Deviance by Roderick Graham](https://www.amazon.com/Cybercrime-Digital-Deviance-Roderick-Graham/dp/0815376308)

I am pretty sure I rented it on Chegg for next to nothing for the semester. Let me know if you want any more indepth resources. I know of a lot of free resources for learning and practicing ethical hacking"
9802,o1th3v,5,"""Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon"" is really interesting in my opinion."
9803,o1th3v,3,Not sure if this fits exactly but Alif the Unseen. It’s a cyberpunk/fantasy but not entirely. It’s about a hacker who lives in the Middle East as we know it who creates a very intelligent computer system using an ancient book about the djinn. A really interesting read!
9804,o1wf29,8,It’s not over thousands of years but I’m reminded of The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin (fantasy) which has 3 plots in different time periods that fill in different parts of the world building as you read
9805,o1wf29,5,Slaughterhouse Five takes this to the extreme lol
9806,o1wf29,5,You'll love Malazan Book of the Fallen.
9807,o1wf29,9,"It actually does sound like OP read it in publication order (mentions origin story as penultimate book and generally taking about nonlinear timeline). I completely agree with you that it's the right way to read them, trying to figure out how best to get my son to read them that way, he's getting close to ready."
9808,o1wf29,3,"I second this! Ender's Game takes place when Wiggin is a boy, then the next three books take place years later and light years away.   


If you follow the Shadow books, the timeline is a little closer together, but still takes big jumps and follows different characters."
9809,o1wf29,3,"Exactly, op says they read Lion Witch Wardrobe first, then Prince Caspian, which takes place much later, and the second-to-last book, The Magician's Nephew, explains the world's origin. The publication order does indeed include nonlinear world-building."
9810,o1wf29,3,"You're not wrong, but it seems like you didnt actually read what op wrote. Because it seems like they did read them in publication order.

Unless they edited their post, idk"
9811,o1wzs8,3,"I’ve got a couple, though I’d suggest taking them with a grain of salt. 
For philosophy, a good history of philosophy is really nice to have, since it can set the backdrop of things you read later. I really liked {The Dream of Reason}. It only covers through the Middle Ages, and only western philosophy, but it is very digestible, in my opinion.
For theology I haven’t read as much. However, I’ve got two that stick out. The one that I actually recocommend is basically anything by CS Lewis. Yes, it’s unofficial lay theology. But it’s very good and, to my knowledge, rarely straight-up heretical. I especially liked {The Screwtape Letters}, though it was especially speculative. As for hardcore philosophy, I found {On Law, Morality, and Politics} by Aquinas interesting, if not a page-turner. It’s a set of excerpts from his Summa Theologica, and it’s the single driest thing I’ve ever read.
Hope this might help!"
9812,o1wzs8,3,"Thank youu!! I will look into these :) I will say, I have read the Screwtape Letters and it was really good! Great minds think alike"
9813,o1wzs8,12,Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a good intro to stoicism
9814,o1wzs8,3,The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts
9815,o1wzs8,5,{{Sophie's World}} by jostein gaarder if u havent already read it but it covers the fundamentals and dives into the history in a pretty entertaining sort of way
9816,o22dbf,34,I know I could just Google this but for the sake of starting  conversation... do you have to read the Lunar Chronicles in order? I got Cress from a Little Free Library recently and I think it was the third one to come out?
9817,o22dbf,9,[deleted]
9818,o22dbf,10,It Ends With Us is beautiful. I dived into the romance genre with this book and I am SO happy about it. I've even read Ugly Love by this author and again not disappointed. Ugly Love probably is my 2nd fav by her. But I actually feel pretty nervous when I start reading any of her books cause I know ill end up crying at some point through the book and the pain won't go away at least for 2 days after reading them.
9819,o22dbf,21,"Yeah you do have to read them in order or you won't understand the whole story. Each book introduces a new character's storyline alongside the old ones. Yeah, Cress is the third one; the order goes- cinder, scarlet, cress and winter."
9820,o22dbf,6,"Aw poop. Well, I guess that just means more books for me!"
9821,o22dbf,5,"Here’s my suggestions hope  these works for you !

This tender land by William Kent Krueger ( similar to Where the crawdads sing)

The book thief by Markus Zsuack( historical fiction)"
9822,o22dbf,3,"Damn, I have the absolutely same favorites in classics except Importance of Being Ernest. Haven't read that."
9823,o22dbf,8,I love that series!
9824,o22dbf,3,The book thief is great!
9825,o22dbf,3,"I’ve liked a lot of the Herman Wouk that I’ve read, good suggestions!"
9826,o22dbf,73,"How is it possible, 3 books a day?? I read maximum 50-100 pages and then get bored"
9827,o22dbf,36,"I'm very curious on how fast you read. Do you know your words per minute?

Edit: I read with ~400 words per minute and a comprehension of ~80%. This very much depends on the text type (Story vs. technical text) and what language."
9828,o22dbf,24,"Serious question: if you read so much, how do you remember anything you've read? I read 2-3 fiction* books per week and sometimes find it hard to remember what I've read. 

I read for fun so don't sweat it so much. But sometimes I wonder if I'm not missing out by letting stories marinate a bit in my memory.

*- Reading nonfiction is a different style of reading for me and I'll try harder to think about content after reading to let it settle in my head.

Edit: clarity"
9829,o22dbf,3,"She’s one of my favourite authors! It ends with us is my fav by her. It’s such a good book but I agree, I always have tissues nearby!"
9830,o22dbf,3,Eragon is one of my absolute favourite sequels. What got me into reading!
9831,o22dbf,3,Same here! I even do rereads every year or so!
9832,o22dbf,3,"I think you'd also like:

* White Fragility (social justice)
* anything by James Baldwin (memoir, social justice, fiction)
* anything by Octavia Butler (sci fi, but also LGBT, feminism, social justice, and so damn readable. My favorites are Kindred, and the Xenogenesis series)
* anything by NK Jemisin (sci fi, and also some similar themes to Octavia Butler. The Broken Earth series is a good place to start, but all is good)
* the Silo series (fun, accessible sci fi)
* The Martian (also very accessible sci fi)
* Anna Karenina (classics)
* The Pillars of the Earth (historical fiction)
* The Hate U Give (YA fiction with social justice issues)
* Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers (pop science about how stress affects your body)"
9833,o22dbf,6,I loved the girl with the dragon tattoo series as well!
9834,o22dbf,5,"Haven't read Cress yet but I've read the first two and trust me, they're worth reading. I'm no expert but I find them to be very solid ya science fiction. Meyer's collection of side-stories, Stars Above, is also great, though I have no idea when it is recommended to read it. I may have spoiled myself by not waiting until after reading the main four books."
9835,o22dbf,15,"my top books; books so good that I get hella jealous that people read them for the first time:

* the kite runner
* red rising series (my fav series)
* to kill a mockingbird
* a prayer for owen meany
* shantaram
* ember in the ashes series
* power of the dog series
* the martian

* ender's game
* 2001 a space odyssey
* the cursebreaker series"
9836,o22dbf,22,Me too. I wanted to finish 150 pages of 1984 yesterday but could only read 50 pages. Glad to see there are others like me!
9837,o22dbf,15,It’s a good series. Worth starting from the beginning.
9838,o22dbf,8,Goodreads is how I track mine!
9839,o22dbf,11,"You picked a really thought provoking, but slightly depressing book to get through. I find many of the classics take a bit more effort than lighter novels. Enjoy, this one had me introspective for a week afterwards!"
9840,o22dbf,123,I’m sorry but 8-12 books a DAY? I do not believe this.
9841,o22dbf,3,Amazing books! Although in the first book it felt like trudging through acid to get past the MC doing research on the family genealogy.
9842,o22dbf,3,"Not OP, but I loved educated. To anyone who didn't grow up in an extremist, incredibly dysfunctional household it might seem far-fetched. However, I always felt like the book was definitely worth a read and absolutely possible."
9843,o22dbf,4,Oh! I read Eragon by Christopher Paolini as a kid! Thanks for the recs and sharing :)) you're amazinggg!
9844,o22dbf,3,"I totally forgot to add this one! I really want to read more mysteries. At first it was a bit slow, but I really need to read the second book!"
9845,o22dbf,48,Yeah I don' buy it either. And even if it is true I don't think it's something anyone should aspire to do. Reading is not about how many books you can read in the least amount of time.
9846,o22dbf,6,"The Hate U Give is great!! I didn't love the second book as much by Angie Thomas. 

I actually am really White Fragility right now! I also suggest The New Jim Crow. I really like to learn and educate myself more on race issues/ relations, which I think is very important as well as impactful. 

I have been meaning to read The Martian and really need to pick up Andy Weir ah!! 

As for Anna Karenina I have had such a hard time keeping track of names (my mind is like a goldfish when it comes to Russian names ah). LOL same with Crime and Punishment / War and Peace. Took me much longer and wish I could enjoy it more"
9847,o22dbf,81,Most definitely some grade A bull shit unless OP just reads the Very Hungry Caterpillar over and over again
9848,o22dbf,3,"Ooo 1984 is great-- have you read Animal Farm? I also read quite a few of Orwell's essays, like Shooting an Elephant. Definitely check out Brave New World too!"
9849,o22dbf,17,"Why not slow down?  One of my favorite parts of reading is - not reading, just walking around processing the things I’ve just read.  I can’t imagine much making an impact at 5+ books a day, but maybe that is just me."
9850,o22dbf,3,"I'm in the middle of rereading the series right now,  the first time I read them was when I was a preteen. Eragon was fantastic, Eldest was fine and I've been on Brisingr now for over a month. I don't know what it is but I find it so slow and meandering 😭 

I want to finish it so bad so I can get to Inheritance because I've never read it! Agh!"
9851,o22dbf,44,"I really don’t get how it’s possible to read 12 books a day. Like considering you have to eat and shower and sleep, and work maybe, how is that a thing? That’s like 1 book per hour. Do you just briefly skim through the pages ?!"
9852,o22dbf,3,"I have same problem.
As a teenager i was able to read 300-400 pages a day but these days are gone. 
I cant imagine reading that fast (not saying it is impossible)"
9853,o22dbf,5,How on earth did you read 5 books a day
9854,o22dbf,52,OP says they are “good” at “scanning” pages. Like at what point are you no longer truly engaging with the material? I’d say it’s some point long before scanning the pages of 3+ books a day.
9855,o22dbf,56,"I’m sorry, but scanning hundreds to thousands of pages a day is not meaningfully engaging with the material.

I mean, do what makes you happy, it’s certainly not hurting anyone, but it’s also not a brag. I don’t personally believe the point to reading should be to quickly scan as many words as possible in a day as opposed to actively reading and considering every word."
9856,o22dbf,28,"You have no reason to lie about this—and I’ve healers of “speed reading”—but this is super human. 

How much do you think you are missing by reading this quickly? Or, do you feel like you are comprehending everything that us mortals digest?"
9857,o22dbf,75,"Let’s give it a little perspective. A fast reader is considered in the range of 50-60 pages per hour. If your average book length is 300-500 pages but you say you read a range of books 250-1000 so let’s just call it 400. Now let’s say you’re a freak of nature record breaking reader and double the range for a fast reader and pretend you’re able to read and comprehend 100 pages an hour. That’s 4 hours per book which makes 8 books 32 hours without a single break. Pardon me if it defies belief that someone is reading twice as quickly as the average fast reader and you still can’t make the math work for the claim.

Again, unless you’re literally scanning the pages skipping swathes of words, which would have a serious affect on comprehension."
9858,o22dbf,20,Second that. I honestly want to know how it works or it’s merely a competition to get a long list of reading.
9859,o22dbf,3,I almost always tear up at the beginning of Brisingr but inheritance is really friggin good. There's some stuff with Oromis and gleadr that gets me pretty good too.
9860,o22dbf,35,"It does appear to be the point of the post, otherwise it wouldn't have been mentioned so enthusiastically me thinks."
9861,o22dbf,3,I need to read some Shakespeare
9862,o22dbf,3,"Most I've read is like 800 in a day but it was all one book and I basically did nothing but read the book and eat, like, once lmao. I guess if OP is only reading and is reading a few average sized novels it's possible."
9863,o22dbf,30,yeah this is literally bullshit
9864,o22dbf,34,"It’s utter bullshit. Whatever OP is doing, it’s not reading the way we usually use that verb. Why are people humouring this? 

Kim Peeks, a savant, could read a page with each eye at once and remembered absolutely everything. But Kim Peeks wouldn’t have been able to write this reddit post."
9865,o22dbf,66,"Why are people humouring this? This is such complete BS. There’s no way on earth you ever meaningfully consumed 8+ regular-length books in a single day. It’s so far beyond what’s possible that it’s just ludicrous.

OP, what do you get out of lying about this?"
9866,o22dbf,30,"It’s not possible without missing a significant amount of details, or you’re reading Goodbye Mr. Chips over and over again."
9867,o22dbf,16,"Yeah, she even says that she scans pages so basically one of those people who skims and says they've read a book."
9868,o22dbf,13,Because it comes off as pretentious.
9869,o22dbf,18,What utter bullshit lmao
9870,o22dbf,8,That’s not even scanning. That’s just a workout for your wrists and fingers.
9871,o22dbf,23,What memories are you taking away from the 8-12 books you’ve read in a single day? Sore eyes? Cramp in your hands?
9872,o22dbf,4,Read it with a play recording audio playing simultaneously. It’s much easier that way and more enjoyable. Much of Shakespearean language is in the tone.
9873,o22dbf,24,"I find funny he says he reads 5 books a day which is pretty ""average"" lol"
9874,o22dbf,16,Totally plausible. I once accidentally read “It” seven times in one day.
9875,o2k6j6,6,"{{Nightwood}} by Djuna Barnes has a lesbian central character and is considered an important modernist work on its own right. She has written other works with lesbian characters but I think Nightwood is probably her best known work. 

I agree that YA is superlame."
9876,o2k6j6,11,"Do you want modern or fantasy/sci-fi?

For modern, I enjoyed Life lessons by Kaje Harper - main hero is a highschool teacher who gets involved in a murder.

After Ben by Con Riley, about gay older man dealing with the loss of his long time partner who finds love again.

For Real by Alexis Hall, 40-smth man involved with gay BDSM community.

Fantasy: Silver in the Wood by Emily Tesh - historical fantasy about a cursed wood

And the classic everyone recommends, The House in the Cerulean Sea by Tj Klune. Main hero is an older children protection worker."
9877,o2k6j6,95,"TJ Klune is an own voice author that writes enjoyable gay fiction. He’s quite prolific and has a few series’ worth of books. 

The House In the Cerulean Sea is his breakout work, and rightly so. It’s very, very good. It features older characters taking care of magical children. His Green Creek series might at first glance be the usual shifter trope common in gay fiction but it’s very heartfelt and I enjoyed reading these 4 books. 

KJ Charles is another prolific writer of gay fiction. Her most famous work is The Magpie Lord which is the first book of a trilogy. I love her works as they have sharp writing, full of wit with a droll British humor that is very enjoyable."
9878,o2k6j6,57,"Maurice by E M Forster. I love this one, and while the MC is a teen at the start, he isn't for the majority of the story."

9880,o2k6j6,176,Giovannis Room by James Baldwin
9881,o2k6j6,14,"Bath Haus by PJ Vernon. This book…It’s Gone Girl with gays and Grindr. The characters are so good. It follows Oliver, 26 and a recovering addict from Indians, and his new husband, Nathan, in his 40s, and a rich doctor in DC. Nathan is out of town so Oliver goes to a gay sauna to hook up and find a thrill he’s lost. And things go wrong—and now Oliver starts lying, to Nathan, to the cops, to keep his secret and to keep his perfect life intact. I won’t say more here, but it gets into gaslighting and toxic relationships and power dynamics and goes places i never saw coming like the best page turners. Fantastic characters, and it’s a dope thriller that just happens to be about gay men."

&gt;PROBLEM:
&gt;You are a failed novelist about to turn fifty. A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: your boyfriend of the past nine years now engaged to someone else. You can’t say yes--it would all be too awkward--and you can’t say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of half-baked literary invitations you’ve received from around the world. 
&gt;
&gt;QUESTION: How do you arrange to skip town?
&gt;
&gt;ANSWER: You accept them all. 
&gt;
&gt;If you are Arthur Less.
&gt;
&gt;Thus begins an around-the-world-in-eighty-days fantasia that will take Arthur Less to Mexico, Italy, Germany, Morocco, India and Japan and put thousands of miles between him and the problems he refuses to face. What could possibly go wrong?
&gt;
&gt;Well: Arthur will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Sahara sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and arrive in Japan too late for the cherry blossoms. In between: science fiction fans, crazed academics, emergency rooms, starlets, doctors, exes and, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to see. Somewhere in there: he will turn fifty. The second phase of life, as he thinks of it, falling behind him like the second phase of a rocket. There will be his first love. And there will be his last.
&gt;
&gt;A love story, a satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, by an author The New York Times has hailed as “inspired, lyrical,” “elegiac,” “ingenious,” as well as “too sappy by half,” Less shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.

&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of The Night Circus, a timeless love story set in a secret underground world—a place of pirates, painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a starless sea.
&gt;
&gt;Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a mysterious book hidden in the stacks. As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues—a bee, a key, and a sword—that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.

9890,o2k6j6,10,I would recommend Memorial by Bryan Washington. It’s been winning all the prizes this year. It’s a literary novel but has also been described as a gay romcom which I guess is also appropriate. It’s funny and poignant at times too.
9891,o2k6j6,3,The Binding by Bridget Collins is a fantasy about a gay main character accepting himself. I really enjoyed it.
9892,o2k6j6,4,Less by Andrew Sean Greer. One of my favs!!!!
9893,o2k6j6,3,"'The Traitor Baru Cormorant' by Seth Dickinson! It's a sweeping geopolitical fantasy (fantasy as in 'another world' rather than 'there's magic') with a lesbian protagonist with lots of focus on the logistics and accounting of empire and rebellion. She's essentially an accountant sent in by the empire (that she secretly hates) to stop a rebellion in its tracks.

'Into the Drowning Deep' by Mira Grant is a great horror/thriller featuring some horrifyingly realistic monster interpretations of sirens and one of the main protagonists is a sapphic autistic woman (can't remember if bi or lesbian)."
9894,o2k6j6,5,"Memoirs of a Mask by Yukio Mishima. Is a (pretty autobiographical) novel about a gay man talking about his experiences since he was a boy, growing up trying to perform normal heterosexuality. It is not everyone's cup of tea (and Mishima was literally a fascist) but I found it weirdly relatable and extremely interesting."

&gt;A magical island. A dangerous task. A burning secret.
&gt;
&gt;Linus Baker leads a quiet, solitary life. At forty, he lives in a tiny house with a devious cat and his old records. As a Case Worker at the Department in Charge Of Magical Youth, he spends his days overseeing the well-being of children in government-sanctioned orphanages.
&gt;
&gt;When Linus is unexpectedly summoned by Extremely Upper Management he's given a curious and highly classified assignment: travel to Marsyas Island Orphanage, where six dangerous children reside: a gnome, a sprite, a wyvern, an unidentifiable green blob, a were-Pomeranian, and the Antichrist. Linus must set aside his fears and determine whether or not they’re likely to bring about the end of days.
&gt;
&gt;But the children aren’t the only secret the island keeps. Their caretaker is the charming and enigmatic Arthur Parnassus, who will do anything to keep his wards safe. As Arthur and Linus grow closer, long-held secrets are exposed, and Linus must make a choice: destroy a home or watch the world burn.
&gt;
&gt;An enchanting story, masterfully told, The House in the Cerulean Sea is about the profound experience of discovering an unlikely family in an unexpected place—and realizing that family is yours.

&gt;
&gt;  When a group of social activists arrive in a small town, the lives and beliefs of residents and outsiders alike are upended, in this wry, embracing novel.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Big Burr, Kansas, is the kind of place where everyone seems to know everyone, and evrryone shares the same values-or keeps their opinions to themselves. But when a national nonprofit labels Big Burr ""the most homophobic town in the US"" and sends in a task force of queer volunteers as an experiment-they'll live and work in the community for two years in an attempt to broaden hearts and minds-no one is truly prepared for what will ensue. 
&gt;
&gt;Furious at being uprooted from her life in Los Angeles and desperate to fit in at her new high school, Avery fears that it's only a matter of time before her ""gay crusader"" mom outs her. Still grieving the death of her son, Linda welcomes the arrivals, who know mercifully little about her past. And for Christine, the newcomers are not only a threat to the comforting rhythms of Big Burr life, but a call to action. As tensions roil the town, cratering relationships and forcing closely guarded secrets into the light, everyone must consider what it really means to belong. Told with warmth and wit, Under the Rainbow is a poignant, hopeful articulation of our complicated humanity that reminds us we are more alike than we'd like to admit.

&gt;The water-breathing descendants of African slave women tossed overboard have built their own underwater society—and must reclaim the memories of their past to shape their future in this brilliantly imaginative novella inspired by the Hugo Award nominated song “The Deep” from Daveed Diggs’ rap group Clipping.
&gt;
&gt;Yetu holds the memories for her people—water-dwelling descendants of pregnant African slave women thrown overboard by slave owners—who live idyllic lives in the deep. Their past, too traumatic to be remembered regularly, is forgotten by everyone, save one—the historian. This demanding role has been bestowed on Yetu.
&gt;
&gt;Yetu remembers for everyone, and the memories, painful and wonderful, traumatic and terrible and miraculous, are destroying her. And so, she flees to the surface, escaping the memories, the expectations, and the responsibilities—and discovers a world her people left behind long ago.
&gt;
&gt;Yetu will learn more than she ever expected to about her own past—and about the future of her people. If they are all to survive, they’ll need to reclaim the memories, reclaim their identity—and own who they really are.
&gt;
&gt;Inspired by a song produced by the rap group Clipping for the This American Life episode “We Are In The Future,” The Deep is vividly original and uniquely affecting.

9998,o2npyy,6,"[**Harold and Maude**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/482977.Harold_and_Maude)

^(By: Colin Higgins | 150 pages | Published: 1971 | Popular Shelves: fiction, romance, humor, classics, kindle | )[^(Search ""Harold and Maude"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Harold and Maude&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Nineteen-year-old Harold Chasen is obsessed with death. He fakes suicides to shock his self-obsessed mother, drives a customized Jaguar hearse, and attends funerals of complete strangers. Seventy-nine-year-old Maude Chardin, on the other hand, adores life. She liberates trees from city sidewalks and transplants them to the forest, paints smiles on the faces of church statues, and “borrows” cars to remind their owners that life is fleeting—here today, gone tomorrow! A chance meeting between the two turns into a madcap, whirlwind romance, and Harold learns that life is worth living. Harold and Maude started as Colin Higgins’ master’s thesis at UCLA Film School, and the script was purchased by Paramount. The film, directed by Hal Ashby, was released in 1971 and it bombed. But soon this quirky, dark comedy began being shown on college campuses and at midnight-movie theaters, and it gained a loyal cult following. This novelization was written by Higgins and published shortly after the film’s release but has been out of print for more than 30 years. Even fans who have seen the movie dozens of times will find this companion valuable, as it gives fresh elements to watch for and answers many of the film’s unresolved questions.

9999,o2npyy,3,Watermelon by Marian Keyes
10000,o2npyy,3,"Great movie, no idea there was book thanks!"
10001,o2o6z2,7,"Along the lines of Ted Chiang, I have also very much enjoyed Ken Liu's short stories. They both have a similar way of writing clever ideas in pared-down language. He has 2 short story collections I'm aware of; both of which I liked: The Paper Menagerie and other stories / The Hidden Girl and other stories.

Also want to recommend The Last Question by Isaac Asimov which is the most impactful short story I've ever read. It's 9 pages long and you can find it for free online. I constantly return to this one - lots of food for thought."
10002,o2o6z2,5,Thanks so much for the recs!
10003,o2o6z2,5,"I’d suggest some Philip K Dick, many of his novels and short stories are “what if” stories, and he’s a great straightforward writer.  I wouldn’t be surprised at all if he’s an influence on the Black Mirror writers, Chiang or Egan. You may have seen movie/tv adaptations of his stuff before, off the top of my head: Blade Runner, Minority Report, The Man In The High Castle, Total Recall are all adaptations of him"
10004,o2o6z2,10,"I suggest the collection *Robot Dreams* by Isaac Asimov and the stories ""The Library of Babel"" by Jorge Luis Borges and ""It's a *Good* Life"" by Jerome Bixby. Someone already suggested Asimov, and this is a cheap and in-print collection of some of his best stories. Many people compare Borges' stories to Chiang's, and this is my favourite of his. Bixby's story was adapted into a very popular episode of *The Twilight Zone*."
10005,o2o6z2,3,"If you like Black Mirror I have these two suggestions:

Tell the Machine Goodnight by Katie Williams

Little Eyes by Samanta Schweblin 

Little Eyes is especially well done. Schweblin writes in Spanish (I read the English translation) and she appears to win major literary prizes around the world."
10006,o2o6z2,3,"You might love {{Invisible Cities}}. Short stories, really awesome. I read it right after Einstein's Dreams and it gave me a similar vibe."
10007,o2o6z2,3,Thank you! Great to have a female author suggested too as the list I gave was very male
10008,o2o6z2,4,"Once you read Invisible Cities, you need to play Braid, as the developer was heavily inspired by both IC and Einstein's Dreams."
10009,o2o6z2,5,"If you like the other suggestions of Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino, I'd like to add in Herman Hesse, specifically The Glass Bead Game. This is a much longer work but deals with similar themes of hermeneutics, heuristics, epistemology, some I guess proto-postmodern ideas about literature, the role of knowledge, education, and teachers/masters have in our lives, the messiness of the modern world, etc."
10010,o2o6z2,4,"Maybe you’d like the short fiction of Shirley Jackson? The collection I read is The Lottery and Other Stories, but there are probably others."
10011,o2o6z2,3,I’ve always gotten serious Twilight Zone vibes from Ray Bradbury’s short stories. You can’t go wrong with the Illustrated Man and the Martian Chronicles.
10012,o2o6z2,3,"It’s a little uneven but Welcome to the Monkey House by Kurt Vonnegut has some twilight zone’y stories. Probably not as good as Illustrated Man by Bradbury or some of the others listed here for your purposes, but it still is a solid collection overall."
10013,o2tx30,21,Fight club
10014,o2tx30,8,This sort of happens in the Inheritance Cycle (Eragon) but it more has to do with who is related to who and how that effects people's view of that person.
10015,o2tx30,30,Oedipus Rex
10016,o2tx30,4,"John Fowles ""Magus"" had similar trope if I'm not mistaken."
10017,o2tx30,5,Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. Its not what this book is mainly about but a person finds out that something he/she assumed about him/herself is not true and this kind of changes a lot how this person sees him/herself. Its not like this scene turns around the whole story and you could argue that its not that big of a deal but I think it quite changes the story and the character. But see for yourself :) Its sci-fi and really really good.
10018,o2tx30,3,"Hmm good topic. 

How about The Rook by Daniel O'Malley? 

Cool story, and his storytelling style is great."
10019,o2tx30,24,"*The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle* by Stuart Turton is filled with manipulative characters and nothing is quite what it seems.  A man wakes up without memories and is trying to not only piece together his identity, but also solve a murder in the process!  Do yourself a favor and don't read spoilers on this, just dive in.

*The Gone World* by Tom Sweterlitsch - A time traveling government worker finds the end of the world, and goes back in time to try and figure out how to stop it.

*Lexicon* by Max Barry is about a girl who attends a school for powered individuals but discovers controversy and conspiracy. Has some moments of a big looming supernatural feeling threat and some legitimately scary adventure moments.

*The Bone Shard Daughter* by Andrea Stewart features a cool fantasy setting inspired by Polynesian Islands/Asian mythology, interesting plot twists and cliffhanger chapter endings, and some very kick ass (but imperfect) characters. I really thought the magic system and looming dread of the setting was very satisfying and I can't wait to watch it be fleshed out.  It's one of the best books I've read in 
the last 12 months for sure and gave me goosebumps at the end.

*The Light Brigade* by Kameron Hurley is a neat mystery book about a soldier in a space war.  We figure out what happened to them as they experience time jumps from their perspective."

10022,o2tx30,3,I came here to give this exact recommendation and point out the same thing. Love that character development.
10023,o2tx30,3,Not a book but the movie Oxygen by Alexandre Aja (on Netflix) is a story you should like.
10024,o2tx30,3,Glad we are on the same page! Got the feeling that some people in the subreddit for this book didnt like the turn but I thought it was great. Just the right amount of imperfection for the character

10028,o2xxvp,87,Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is another classic one if you haven't read it. Kind of the inversion of the premise of 1984.

&gt;Lazlo Ratesic is 54, a 19-year veteran of the Speculative Service, from a family of law enforcement and in a strange alternate society that values law and truth above all else. This is how Laz must, by law, introduce himself, lest he fail to disclose his true purpose or nature, and by doing so, be guilty of a lie.
&gt;
&gt;Laz is a resident of The Golden State, a nation resembling California, where like-minded Americans retreated after the erosion of truth and the spread of lies made public life, and governance, increasingly impossible. There, surrounded by the high walls of compulsory truth-telling, knowingly contradicting the truth--the Objectively So--is the greatest possible crime. Stopping those crimes, punishing them, is Laz's job. In its service, he is one of the few individuals permitted to harbor untruths--to ""speculate"" on what might have happened in the commission of a crime.
&gt;
&gt;But the Golden State is far less a paradise than its name might suggest. To monitor, verify, and enforce the Objectively So requires a veritable panopticon of surveillance, recording, and record-keeping. And when those in control of the truth twist it for nefarious means, the Speculators may be the only ones with the power to fight back.

&gt;
&gt;Lauren Olamina and her family live in one of the only safe neighborhoods remaining on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

While her father tries to lead people on the righteous path, Lauren struggles with hyperempathy, a condition that makes her extraordinarily sensitive to the pain of others.
&gt;
&gt;When fire destroys their compound, Lauren’s family is killed and she is forced out into a world that is fraught with danger. With a handful of other refugees, Lauren must make her way north to safety, along the way conceiving a revolutionary idea that may mean salvation for all mankind.

&gt;A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.
&gt;
&gt;A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.
&gt;
&gt;The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.

10036,o2xxvp,23,"I suggest you ""We"" by Yevgeny Zamyatin, this novel inspired other dystopian novels such as ""1984"" by George Orwell and ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley."
10037,o2xxvp,5,Hyperion - Dan Simmons
10038,o2xxvp,3,"Check out Dhalgren by Samuel R. Delaney, 1975. It's like the Ulysses of Sci Fi novels and it's a perfect dystopian odyssey. I won't give too much away except to say that the protagonist is an unnamed wanderer who visits a city in the American Midwest that has been effected by some unknown catastrophe which has severed it from the rest of the world and exists as a sort of post-apocalyptic refuge for those who do not fit in society. It's very stream-of-consciousness and nothing is ever quite as it seems. I highly recommend it, though I cannot guarantee you will be able to make sense of the journey it takes you on."
10039,o2xxvp,6,"I tried to read ""We"" when I was a teenager and I couldn't get into it (probably because I had a really short attention span then). I knew it inspired Orwell to write 1984, and I read an interview with Noam Chomsky a couple of years ago in which he said that he believes it is the best dystopian novel ever written. I am going to pick up a copy. I'm sure that I will enjoy it :)"
10040,o2xxvp,20,"It is subtle, but a lot of Ishiguro’s novels are dystopian. He is a master of revealing what is dystopian and horrific slowly, so you have to be patient. I highly recommend his most recent book Klara and the Sun. It is beautiful and disturbing.

In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride.

&gt;The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. 
&gt;
&gt;Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers...
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away...

The Crakers’ reluctant prophet, Snowman-the-Jimmy, is hallucinating; Amanda is in shock from a Painballer attack; and Ivory Bill yearns for the provocative Swift Fox, who is flirting with Zeb. Meanwhile, giant Pigoons and malevolent Painballers threaten to attack.

&gt;From Nobel Prize–winning author José Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss
&gt;
&gt;A city is hit by an epidemic of ""white blindness"" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations, and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As Blindness reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.

&gt;
&gt;But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.

&gt;A gargantuan, mind-altering tragi-comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America. 
&gt;
&gt;Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. 
&gt;
&gt;Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human—and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.

&gt;Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko... 
&gt;
&gt;Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. 
&gt;
&gt;What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? Award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi delivers one of the most highly acclaimed science fiction novels of the twenty-first century.

10090,o2xxvp,3,"{{The Heart Goes Last}} by Margaret Atwood

Maybe a little too sci fi for you but The Long Earth series, by Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Baxter, is sort of a cross of sci fi and dystopian. 5 books. I think its AWESOME. 

{{The Time Machine}} by H.G. Wells though again, a bit sci fi focused 

Also loved The Power, as someone else mentioned above, and the Oryx and Crake series...

10091,o2xxvp,3,"{{Never Let Me Go}}

A little bit different from most dystopian novels in that the focus of the plot isn’t really on the dystopian society at all, but more human emotion and relationships. One of my all time favorite books, though it’s often overshadowed by Ishiguro’s more known novel, The Remains of the Day."

&gt;Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.
&gt;
&gt;Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.
&gt;
&gt;Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.

10094,o2xxvp,3,Tender is the Flesh by Augustina Bazterrica! I thought about this one for weeks after finishing it.
10095,o2xxvp,21,"The Modern Library ranked Brave New World the 5th best English language novel of the 20th century.  Not the 5th best sci fi book, the 5th best novel.  This is their squib on it, which compares it to 1984, which they ranked #13:

&gt; Though Brave New World is less famous than George Orwell’s 1984, it arguably presents a world that more closely resembles our own: a world of easy sex, readily available and mood-altering pharmaceuticals, information overload, and mass production.  Juxtaposing Orwell’s and Huxley’s dystopias, the critic Neil Postman commented: “What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. . . . Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance.”

They ranked another dystopian novel #65.  That would be A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess.  [Here’s the entire Modern Library 100 Best Novels list.](https://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/)

In addition to these I would also recommend Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro."

&gt;War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches features stories by the brightest stars in the science fiction firmament. One of the most startlingly original and entertaining SF anthology concepts in years, perfectly preserving the spirit of H. G. Wells's classic. H. G. Wells's immortal novel The War of the Worlds describes an invasion from Mars through the fictional dispatches of a London newspaper reporter. Yet we have been able to see only one segment of the global catastrophe - until now. Here is the Martian invasion that might have been, from the Earthlings best prepared to tell the tale. Besides the struggle in England, the reporter mentions similar battles taking place all over the planet. From Teddy Roosevelt in Cuba to the Dowager Empress in China, we see our fellow humans encounter the Martian menace through the eyes of science fiction luminaries: --In Providence, Rhode Island, an eight-year-old H. P. Lovecraft bravely seeks communion with an alien intelligence - and a return to his long-lost home; --In Russia, a letter by Count Leo Tolstoy describes the coming of the ultimate revolution; --In a dark woods outside of Zurich, a heroic Albert Einstein finds himself trapped inside a Martian craft, where survival itself is relative; --In Amherst, Massachussetts, Emily Dickinson leaves poetic evidence that she encountered the Martians eleven years after her death; --In Paris, a young artist named Pablo Picasso is inspired by the Martian carnage to create his most shocking and disturbing masterpiece.

10110,o2xxvp,3,Personally i think brave new world is better than 1984 just by a little
10111,o2xxvp,3,"Legend by Marie Lu
Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro"
10112,o2xxvp,3,Agree.  The Dog Stars is fantastic.
10113,o2xxvp,3,Exactly!! The basis of it totally makes you feel like it took place in a dystopian world.
10114,o2xxvp,3,"Regardless of whether The Road would be technically classified as dystopian or not, you'll like it if you enjoy the genre."
10115,o2zqrg,46,"Roger Zelazny's {{Lord of Light}} won the Hugo award, and is one of the great classics of the field. Zelazny was one of the most talented and poetic writers around, and _Lord of Light_ is one of his best works. Although it's technically science fiction or science fantasy, it feels like fantasy; on a distant planet in the far future, people who've modified themselves into the form of Hindu gods struggle over the question of freedom and technology. The ending always leaves me with a lump in my throat.

Barry Longyear's _The God Box_ is a fantasy about a rug merchant who gains a very strange inheritance that sends him on a trip through time as well as across the world. His travels are exciting, funny, enlightening and in the end deeply moving. The concept of the ""god box"" has stuck with me ever since I read this book. I highly recommend it.

{{Bridge of Birds}} by Barry Hughart is the first of three books in that series, and it won the World Fantasy Award in 1985. Set in ""an ancient China that never was"", it's the story of a young peasant man who's as strong as an ox, and an ancient sage with a slight flaw in his character. It draws on Chinese folk tales and history, as well as a bit of Sherlock Holmes. It's a mystery with magic, humor, adventure, and it's simply mind-blowing. I'm always choked up by the end.

&gt;Earth is long since dead. On a colony planet, a band of men has gained control of technology, made themselves immortal, and now rule their world as the gods of the Hindu pantheon. Only one dares oppose them: he who was once Siddhartha and is now Mahasamatman. Binder of Demons, Lord of Light.

&gt;When the children of his village were struck with a mysterious illness, Number Ten Ox sought a wiseman to save them. He found master Li Kao, a scholar with a slight flaw in his character. Together, they set out to find the Great Root of Power, the only possible cure.
&gt;
&gt;The quest led them to a host of truly memorable characters, multiple wonders, incredible adventures—and strange coincidences, which were really not coincidences at all. And it involved them in an ancient crime that still perturbed the serenity of Heaven. Simply and charmingly told, this is a wry tale, a sly tale, and a story of wisdom delightfully askew. Once read, its marvels and beauty will not easily fade from the mind.
&gt;
&gt;The author claims that this is a novel of an ancient China that never was. But, oh…it should have been!

&gt;Working at the local processing plant, Marcos is in the business of slaughtering humans —though no one calls them that anymore.
&gt;
&gt;His wife has left him, his father is sinking into dementia, and Marcos tries not to think too hard about how he makes a living. After all, it happened so quickly. First, it was reported that an infectious virus has made all animal meat poisonous to humans. Then governments initiated the “Transition.” Now, eating human meat—“special meat”—is legal. Marcos tries to stick to numbers, consignments, processing.
&gt;
&gt;Then one day he’s given a gift: a live specimen of the finest quality. Though he’s aware that any form of personal contact is forbidden on pain of death, little by little he starts to treat her like a human being. And soon, he becomes tortured by what has been lost—and what might still be saved.

&gt;A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.
&gt;
&gt;Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .
&gt;Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.
&gt;But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.
&gt;
&gt;As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.

10230,o2zqrg,7,"Came here to say Life of Pi! Read it close to 15 years ago but I still think about it, too. A lot of Yann Martel’s books are like that, but this was my first one I ever read."
10231,o2zqrg,10,"The biggest agree. It's a book that juggles so many plates at the same time, adding more and more with each chapter, and keeps stacking them on top of each other. And you *know* the author will have no way to wrap up all those stories in a satisfying way. And then Dumas actually does.

Don't agree with it being a slog though, the first of six parts is a bit slow, but after the time skip - shit picks up real quick and heads start rolling."
10232,o2zqrg,12,Didn’t count
10233,o2zqrg,17,Ugh that fucking ending. I was listening to the audiobook in an office surrounded by people and just absolutely feeling all the feels while trying to look hard at work.
10234,o2zqrg,4,"It came together so perfectly that I burst into tears, and I never cry while reading. Truly a masterpiece."
10235,o2zqrg,3,"It sure is! I've had a couple of funny experiences with *Bridge of Birds*, actually.

The first was from about thirty years ago. You might not know that Barry Hughart wrote a book prior to *Bridge of Birds* called ***A*** *Bridge of Birds*. It was an early attempt at the novel, but it was extremely different; Master Li was young, and Number Ten Ox was a very minor character. It was effectively an almost completely different book. It wasn't published.

There was an early website with a maze game; as you solved each section, the complete text of a chapter of *A Bridge of Birds* was revealed (not necessarily in order). I mapped that maze and captured the text of every chapter. I assembled them in the correct order and converted the whole thing into a PDF. Then I posted it in a hidden spot on my personal website. There was a clue or two that would allow an astute reader to find it, but I didn't think that would happen often.

I should note that *A Bridge of Birds* had **not been published**. If it had been, I wouldn't have posted it; well probably not, anyway. The original maze game website went away, and it appeared that I was the only person who'd captured all of the text. So my copy was the only copy available online for a couple of decades or so.

Eventually omnibus editions of all three Master Li and Number Ten Ox novels were published, and some of them included *A Bridge of Birds* as an extra. It's still available on my site, but I don't talk about it much.

The other funny thing was less interesting, perhaps. I reread *Bridge of Birds* at least once a year after it came out in 1985. When my son was born - actually, several months *before* he was born - I started reading and singing to him every night. I'd been collecting my own favorite children's and YA books from my childhood all along, so I had plenty to read to him. When he got old enough, I read him *Bridge of Birds*.

He loved it. But during the reading (and more so when reading him *The Story of The Stone*), I made a surprising discovery: Hughart had a terrible predilection towards comma splices. His books were FILLED with comma splices, with two and often **three** sentences joined together by commas. And yet I'd never noticed it for the dozen or more times I had read it to myself. That's when I learned that you don't really know a book completely until you've read it aloud.

Incidentally I still read to my son fairly often. Even though he'll be twenty soon.

Anyway, as I mentioned elsewhere you can see the [working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTP07TZZ2akERIm7dc9haQPlEVGilq7n49xY5z4KB6dE3Q_Kospi-Y3sK2InIh2Zstc2uZSse0QQLo-/pub) where I store all of my recommendations as I write them. I added several today."
10236,o2zqrg,5,"LOL, it's just that I grew up before the internet and computers were common, although oddly enough I played one of the first computer games as a toddler at MIT in the late 60s (my dad was a graduate student there), and I also was using the internet as early as the mid-to-late 1980s.

But I was a hardcore bibliophile, and still am. I was one of those kids who read secretly in class, during lunch, and during recess. I got beaten up a lot as a result. But I'm a high-speed reader and my memory is great. So my brain is full of stories and facts.

Niven and Pournelle wrote a sequel to their *Inferno* relatively recently. It's called {{Escape From Hell}}, and as I recall it's pretty good."

I feel so sad that it seems hard to find that anymore. I try the Pulitzer noms and winners, but it’s just not the same anymore. I have thought recently that maybe it’s just me getting older.

^(By: Tim Marshall | 256 pages | Published: 2015 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, history, politics, nonfiction, geography | )[^(Search ""Prisoners of Geography"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Prisoners of Geography&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;In the bestselling tradition of Why Nations Fail and The Revenge of Geography, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers.
&gt;
&gt;All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people, ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely Prisoners of Geography, seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.
&gt;
&gt;In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography? Why will Europe never be united? Why will America never be invaded? Shining a light on the unavoidable physical realities that shape all of our aspirations and endeavors, Prisoners of Geography is the critical guide to one of the major (and most often overlooked) determining factors in world history.

^(By: Bill Bryson | 544 pages | Published: 2003 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, science, history, nonfiction, owned | )[^(Search ""History of Nearly Everything"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=History of Nearly Everything&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.

&gt;Why did Gandhi hate iodine (I, 53)? Why did the Japanese kill Godzilla with missiles made of cadmium (Cd, 48)? How did radium (Ra, 88) nearly ruin Marie Curie's reputation? And why did tellurium (Te, 52) lead to the most bizarre gold rush in history?
&gt;
&gt;The periodic table is one of our crowning scientific achievements, but it's also a treasure trove of passion, adventure, betrayal and obsession. The fascinating tales in The Disappearing Spoon follow carbon, neon, silicon, gold and every single element on the table as they play out their parts in human history, finance, mythology, conflict, the arts, medicine and the lives of the (frequently) mad scientists who discovered them.
&gt;
&gt;Why did a little lithium (Li, 3) help cure poet Robert Lowell of his madness? And how did gallium (Ga, 31) become the go-to element for laboratory pranksters? The Disappearing Spoon has the answers, fusing science with the classic lore of invention, investigation, discovery and alchemy, from the big bang through to the end of time.

&gt;An economist's version of The Way Things Work, this engaging volume is part field guide to economics and part expose of the economic principles lurking behind daily events, explaining everything from traffic jams to high coffee prices. 
&gt;The Undercover Economist is for anyone who's wondered why the gap between rich and poor nations is so great, or why they can't seem to find a decent second-hand car, or how to outwit Starbucks. This book offers the hidden story behind these and other questions, as economist Tim Harford ranges from Africa, Asia, Europe, and of course the United States to reveal how supermarkets, airlines, and coffee chains--to name just a few--are vacuuming money from our wallets. Harford punctures the myths surrounding some of today's biggest controversies, including the high cost of health-care; he reveals why certain environmental laws can put a smile on a landlord's face; and he explains why some industries can have high profits for innocent reasons, while in other industries something sinister is going on. Covering an array of economic concepts including scarce resources, market power, efficiency, price gouging, market failure, inside information, and game theory, Harford sheds light on how these forces shape our day-to-day lives, often without our knowing it. 
&gt; Showing us the world through the eyes of an economist, Tim Harford reveals that everyday events are intricate games of negotiations, contests of strength, and battles of wits. Written with a light touch and sly wit, The Undercover Economist turns ""the dismal science"" into a true delight.

10319,o3e3vj,5,"[**Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics)

^(By: Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner | 268 pages | Published: 2005 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, economics, nonfiction, business, science | )[^(Search ""Freakonomics"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Freakonomics&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.
&gt;
&gt;These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.
&gt;
&gt;Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.
&gt;
&gt;What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.
&gt;
&gt;Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.

10327,o3e3vj,3,"Paul Verhaeghe - Love in Times of Loneliness

It's a collection of three essays about the complex relationship between men and women, touches on why they sometimes seem so different, touches on power structures etc. It incorporates some ideas from Freud and Nietzsche, but you don't need to have read anything fromt them since it is all explained well. Also, it's not dry at all. The author has a sense of humor, which is nice.

What also helps a lot is to read a classic book for a certain time period or style, and then read a book about that book. For instance, it's interesting to read Hamlet, and then read a bit about Hamlet. You'll see that the great works of the past and today are closely intertwined with contemporary society and politics and religion, personalities and fears of the age (in the case of Hamlet, that would be Baroque and the existential doubts of the age with the reformation and the copernican revolution that altered society and our perspective of our place in the universe reflected in that style)."

I'd suggest a different approach: Pick on topic of your interest, ask for the most relevant book and if it is a serious book it always contains a bibliography. Check the bibliography and pick the next one, and so on and so forth. You will involuntarily stumble on questions while reading that must be answered.

I make it a point to read at least 100 books a year, and though it's very long, there is no better single work (well, if you can call a multi-volume work a ""single"" work) than Will and Ariel Durant's Story of Civilization. It's 11 volumes, but if you can work through one a month, you will finish it in a year, and not only plug 99% of all your knowledge gaps but, more importantly, have the historical and philosophical perspective to actually understand things are going on today. After reading the set cover-to-cover, I've made my way through several volumes multiple times, and re-read at least one volume every year. Will Durant is a magician with his pen, and his ""Story of Philosophy"" is also well worth checking out.

Once you finish that, I would recommend anything by Steven Pinker (especially ""The Blank Slate,"" ""The Language Instinct"", and ""Enlightenment Now""), Yuval Noah Harari (his entire trilogy of books are world your time, but ""Sapiens"" is my favorite), and Jonathan Haidt (""The Righteous Mind,"" ""The Happiness Hypothesis,"" and ""The Coddling of the American Mind,"" probably in that order).

Finally, I would recommend some of the classics. I great book I go back to time and time again is ""The New Lifetime Reading Plan"" by Fadiman and Major. It has a list of some of the great books of Eastern and Western cultures, and I just check off the books as I read them. Best of luck to you!"

10410,o3e3vj,6,"&gt;I must agree. I've listened to between 50-100 courses from the Great Courses (back since they were the Teaching Company), and using the reviews already posted on their website, you can't go wrong with anything over 4 stars."

10412,o3e3vj,4,"The Constitution of the United States, Declaration of Independance, and Bill of Rights. Surprisingly short read and should be the core of your understanding of US politics."
10413,o3e3vj,6,Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City by Matthew Desmond.
10414,o3e3vj,4,"Great recommendation. This book doesn't cover political science in a comprehensive way, because it's presenting Machiavelli's theory alone, but it's surprisingly readable and gives you a broad sense of the kinds of things that other political philosophies will address. It's also always relevant because Machiavelli focuses so much on building and keeping power that you can see the work of Machiavellian politicians throughout history and even today. 

One of the things I find interesting is that The Prince is Machiavelli's most known work, but it's likely that his true political beliefs were better expressed in his Discourses on Livy, which are longer and much harder to read. His constructs are thought to be the foundation for the modern republic by some scholars. I've read both works, but unless someone is SUPER into political theory, I'd only ever recommend The Prince."

10418,o3e3vj,3,"Gladwell, Ehrenreich, possibly others in this post are journalists, not academics or specialists in the field they write about. So be careful with them- they usually cherrypick anecdotes and interviews to create a straight forward case for a much more complex, nuanced topic.  You can read them if you want to win an argument but not if you want to truly understand a topic."
10419,o3e3vj,3,"&gt;If I don't have a basic culture on them, how do I know if I like or want to study further something else as well?

just trust your gut feeling, if something is interesting your hunger for knowledge will increase, if things become suddenly boring switch to the next book. Let's say give every book you start a chance to get your interest/attention, if after 50 pages you dont want to read more, stop reading and take the next one. 

if you like altogether electronics, physics and mathematics it sounds to me you look for something that explains mechanical engineering from the first principles, starting from really the basics of the basic. So try this: Electromechanics: Principles, Concepts and Devices by James Harter  or  Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. 

Regarding philosophy, you have to first get a glimpse of the differences between the western culture, the eastern cultures and all others around the globe to understand the whole philosophical frameworks. The western civilization should be easy, but do you know why people behave in other parts of the world how they behave? I think you should dive deeping into answering this question. There is no simple answer and I dont know it either."
10420,o3e3vj,5,Great list!  Your bottom top are my top 2 so I must get the rest you recommended!
10421,o3e3vj,5,"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Kuhn. Philosophy of science that probably needs to be read along with something from Isiah Berlin to get both perspectives.

What is History by Carr on philosophy of history

Nassim Taleb - The Black Swan or Fooled by Randomness. About the role of uncertainy and modern attempts to account for the risk of this uncertainy. 

Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman

Edit: thought I'd try to add some books regarding philosophy of government and state- i avoided this at first because I didn't want to be accused of selecting biased sources. But a lot of ground can be covered by going over the concept of State of Nature. Hobbes Leviathan, Then Locke's Social Contract. 

Nozicks Anarchy, State, Utopia, which is a response to Rawls's A Theory of Justice (very influential in modern politics and its concepts need to be understood)

For a single book, Francis Fukuyama's. Origin of Political Order does a good survey of the formation of Political systems up to modernity. He criticises both Marx and Hayek, so maybe that middle ground enough."

10425,o3e3vj,15,"I don't get why this book gets recommended to beginners on here tbh. I've tried reading it and thought it was the most vague and pretentious book I've ever read. Didn't understand even half of what is written in it (granted, English is not my first language, so maybe that could be the problem, but I have no trouble at all with most other books). I also think it's a bad idea to start off with a book that has you reflecting and processing the meaning of the text constantly.

So, before I get downvoted, I want to emphasize that this is my 2 cents on it AS someone like OP who didn't read much until a couple years back. This book is IMO for people who are already avid readers who want to expand their knowledge of stoicism"

10427,o3e3vj,3,"Give Richard Feynman’s books a shot. My two favorites are “surely you’re joking, mr. Feynman!” And another is something along the lines of “the joy of finding things out.”  They’re both really good reads."

10433,o3e3vj,7,"I agree. As someone who isn't looking to spend years analysing philosophical texts and their contexts, OP would benefit way more from a summary, more or less unbiased and holistic. If they want to dig deeper into a particular idea afterwards, they can do that, but definitely better to get a walkthrough first."

10436,o3e3vj,3,Debt - The First 5000 Years by David Graeber is a really good book about what money is and why it matters
10437,o3e3vj,3,"For physics/cosmology (and some other bonus knowledge on geography and some biology):

The Science of the Discworld, by Terry Pratchett and two other co-authors.

This is a delightful, entertaining, and best of all very accurate and good treatment mostly on the physics of cosmology (big bang, formation of stars and galaxies, black holes and white dwarfs, zooming in eventually to the formation of our solar system, then of the earth, and finally, to the birth and evolution of life on earth).  I am a physicist and I can say this is one of the best popular-science-type reads on these subjects that I've ever had the pleasure to find!

Best of all for those short on time, it comes in an audiobook form with a master narrator.

The chapters alternate between two sets of chapters -- one set makes up an entertaining, fictional framework story, which serves to set up the other set of chapters as they explore the physics of the real-world universe."

10441,o3e3vj,3,The Big Ideas series by DK. It has a range of subjects you can learn about
10442,p842p3,4,Try Finding Violet by Bella Price. It’s like a combo of fantasy and realism. Found my copy on Amazon
10443,p842p3,25,"I recommend the *Witches* and *Tiffany Aching* sub-series of the *Discworld* series by Terry Pratchett. Both sub-series are great but the *Tiffany Aching* is more like a Ghibli movie because the protagonist is young. It starts with *The Wee Free Men*. All the novels are standalone and fairly short.

Here's the whole *Witches* series with reviews on Goodreads:

[https://www.goodreads.com/series/109517-discworld---witches-series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/109517-discworld---witches-series)

10444,p842p3,5,Have you read Alice Hoffman’s works? Her practical magic series definitely falls into this vibe.
10445,p842p3,7,Came here to recommend these as well!
10446,p842p3,5,"Standalone you say? Nice. Does it have lots of nods to the other Pratchett books? I've yet t ready any of those, but maybe I'd do those first."
10447,p842p3,4,"Yes. The *Discworld* books often interrelate, since they are set in the same world. But you really don’t have to read them all unless you want to. 

Pratchett took a little while to consistently hit his stride, so some people choose not to read all 41 books in the series. That said, I very much enjoyed reading them all in order and seeing his characters and his writing evolve."
10448,p842p3,5,"Another hearty recommendation for the Discworld Witches series and the Tiffany Aching series. 

I love Discworld, but I read'em all out of order and I'm glad I did. The early books are funny parodies, but the later books are really wonderful. I don't think I would have continued if I'd started with the first books - they're very of their time (1980's).

If you like having things in order, I'd go ahead and read the Witches series first, and if then the Tiffany Aching books. The first Witches book came pretty early in Discworld, so it's a best of both worlds scenario!"
10449,p842p3,7,Not sure it's completely low stakes exactly but a lot of *Tehanu* by Ursula K. LeGuin is quite mundane/slice of life-y. Of course u should probably read the first three *Earthsea* books first which are much more epic in style...
10450,p842p3,25,"If you haven’t read her, Diana Wynn Jones is the author of Howl’s Moving Castle and all of her books are brilliant."
10451,p842p3,3,The Hearing Trumpet by Leonora Carrington ticks all the boxes except maybe the Ghibli one.
10452,p842p3,3,Not witches exactly but Lonely Werewolf Girl or The Good Fairies of New York by Martin Millar. So cute and a good story.
10453,p842p3,4,Maybe you would like The Girl Who Drank The Moon by Kelly Barnhill
10454,p842p3,4,"Oh! Highly recommend Howl’s Moving Castle by Diana Wynn Jones if you’re interested in Ghibli-esqu literature. It’s the novel the movie of the same name was based on, and is written by an English novelist who’s just really freaking good."
10455,p842p3,3,Try *The Golem and the Jinni* by Wecker. I'm enjoying the heck out of it!
10456,p890t2,4,"Not 100% what you want but Stephen R. Lawhead does a lot of Celtic stuff. 

He does a Welsh version of Robin Hood and treats it extremely realistically. It's about a young, brash man who has kingship thrust upon him and the Ffreinc (Normans) coming into Wales and expanding their power. So he dons a cloak of raven feathers and does Robin Hood shit as Rhy Bran y Hud. (King Bran the Enchanter) and one of his vassals is anglicized to Alan Adale and he anglicizes the story to brave Robin Hood. 

I highly recommend it. First book is Hood."

10459,p8ai9l,5,Twilight.
10460,p8ai9l,75,"For me any Coelho's or Ayn Rand's book (but especially _The Alchemist_ and _Atlas Shrugged_) is a huge red flag. So is _Fifty Shades of Grey_, but it'd be quite unlikely to hear it on a gay date.

If a guy is team Dostoevsky, I'll be ok with it, Dostoevsky's an established classic author. But I'd rather date someone who's team Tolstoy."
10461,p8ai9l,32,I'd just be glad she's reading at all
10462,p8ai9l,35,Immediately complaining about twilight in 2021 is a red flag
10463,p8ai9l,29,"I used to think that too, but then had a date with a guy with such incompatible taste in books, so the topic was off the table anyway."
10464,p8ai9l,16,"I will second Ayn Rand. Not at all familiar with Coelho, so I'll withhold judgment on that."
10465,p8ai9l,6,With Coelho I'd rather recommend you to stay that way. I couldn't believe my eyes it was a bestseller.
10466,p8ai9l,62,"I don’t think there’s any that I would end a date because they liked, other than maybe someone like Rush Limbaugh, but then I think our incompatibility would go way beyond taste it books.

However, if someone said they did NOT like Shirley Jackson or Toni Morrison we’d really have some issues and there’s no way we could coexist or coinhabit the same space."
10467,p8ai9l,11,"Lol, maybe Dan Brown"
10468,p8ai9l,16,Believe it or not women don’t enjoy listening to men complain about largely harmless romp from a decade ago.
10469,p8ai9l,12,"May I ask how your tastes in books were incompatible? I've never had family or friends or romantic partners who were as interested in books as I am, so I never imagined how this would play out."
10470,p8ai9l,75,"Indians will get this. Durjoy Dutta and Chetan Bhagat.
Also generally, people who are too much into self help books seem shady to me. Generally, they are the ones who spend too much time on social media bragging about the one book they have read in years. I also find these self help people narcissistic."
10471,p8ai9l,29,"I think it's more about how people talk about books. If someone says that either Atlas Shrugged or 12 Rule for Life is their favorite book of all time we might have deeper compatibility issues.

Honestly, being a non-reader is probably the biggest deal breaker."
10472,p8ai9l,6,Bukowski and Ayn Rund
10473,p8ai9l,4,"I wouldn’t say any books were dealbreakers but I would say some books are never going to be discussed ever if we have really different opinions. My cousin loves The Handmaid’s Tale and I despise so we agree to disagree and just never bring it up. 

I guess if the author or book was like super problematic and it showed a big difference in political views that couldn’t similarly be brushed aside that would be an issue. But like them liking 1984 is just something we’d never talk about and forget so that we may live on in peace."
10474,p8ai9l,8,I dated a woman whose favorite novel was Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. I should have taken that as a major red flag.
10475,p8ai9l,46,"When a man says his favorite book is The Catcher in the Rye. A Clockwork Orange, while a great book, can also be suspicious"
10476,p8ai9l,22,"Along those lines, *Infinite Jest* has such a bad rap that even though it's a fantastic book you'd better have a second favourite, lol."
10477,p8ai9l,4,"I tried with Coelho after an uncle recommended it. Unreadable dross. Then I thought about my uncle, faking interest and compassion, hiding secret rage and misogyny under a veneer kind concern, a physchotherapist who desperately needs therapy himself, and realized that of course I would hate the book that he so seriously vibed with. 

Also, Ayn Rand. No."
10478,p8ai9l,15,Stephanie Meyer. I read her twilight books years ago to see what the hype was. Oh gods. 🤢
10479,p8ai9l,36,"When my husband bought Rush Limbaugh's book ages ago (we've been happily married since 1986) I told him to get rid of it or read it in the car, it wasn't coming in to my house.  After looking at me to see if I was serious, he read it on his work lunch breaks and tossed it.  Never mentioned it again either."
10480,p8ai9l,12,"Okay, valid, but have you read The Host?"
10481,p8ai9l,9,"Quevedo. In Spanish literature from 1600s were two poets, Quevedo and Góngora, who lead two opposite literary movements, and sometimes they even wrote poems to insult each other. Nowadays there's still a ""friendly"" rivalry between those who like Quevedo's poetry and those who like Góngora's."
10482,p8ai9l,5,"oh gosh! *The Alchemist* is on my tbr and I’ve never read anything by Coelho, is it really that bad?"
10483,p8ai9l,3,"AMEN!!

A man who's Team Pushkin I'm proposing to him lol!!!"
10484,p8ai9l,31,The Bible!
10485,p8ai9l,33,Maybe not a deal breaker as a book but one time had a guy mansplain Kerouac to me on a date and now I don't even want to touch anything by him.
10486,p8ai9l,4,I'm curious as to why?
10487,p8ai9l,5,"Oh, absolutely. I read his books in high school so whenever an adult likes them I inwardly scoff :( I am an asshole"
10488,p8ai9l,46,"Anything by Jordan Peterson or similar. Something that shows fundamental incompatbilty. I don’t care if they don’t have reading as a hobby, but having similar values is very important to me."
10489,p8ai9l,9,Is there something I’m missing about liking 1984? Or are we talking about liking it as a handbook for politics etc?
10490,p8ai9l,8,"this sub is pretty split on it. half the people hate it and say it's preachy parable-esque crap, but other people find it inspiring or an otherwise enjoyable read. i personally enjoyed it, but i also didn't take it too seriously. i think part of it is if you approach it as it's advertised- a self help book- it's probably a lot easier to find it preachy. if you're just looking for a story, i don't think it's that bad."
10491,p8ai9l,9,"Chetan Bhagat is one of those authors you can ignore cause a lot of people start off reading through his books (altho I agree he's a shitty writer). 
But Durjoy Datta? My IQ went down by 50 or something when I read his books. He writes absolutely bullshit stuff."
10492,p8ai9l,6,"I'm a straight dude, but I would also be immediately concerned if a date mentioned those. A potential friend mentioning them as favorites is also not a great sign for that friendship.

Had someone tell me *Twilight*, when she was in her early thirties when those came out. It didn't work out, but that was just a mild yikes at the start of a bad date overall.

Different date rattled off *50 Shades of Grey*, but that was definitely not the reason that was a bad date. It was definitely bad, but books didn't really enter into why."
10493,p8ai9l,25,I don't mind intelligent discussion.  I do mind blind one sided know-it-alls.   The kind that shout libtard and snowflake.   Not happening.
10494,p8ai9l,3,"We will only spell it ""Rund"" from now on. That's the new spelling, that's how it's pronounced.

""Ann Rund""

Edit: ""Unn Rund"""
10495,p8ai9l,24,I think it gets a lot of hate unnecessarily. It’s written like a fairy tale with a kind of baby’s first philosophy vibe to it and people seem offended that it’s not the pinnacle of literature. It’s also a relatively quick read so it’s not like it’s a huge waste of time. I thought it wasn’t bad but I guess if you were told it was incredible you might be disappointed.
10496,p8ai9l,18,"You can counter by quoting Truman Capote on the subject of Kerouac and other beat writers - 'that's not writing, that's just typing.'"
10497,p8ai9l,8,"I feel like why something is their favorite is really important to me for why something is their favorite. As long as the book isn’t pushing a political agenda I thuroughly disagree with that doesn’t have any other substance, most books will have some ok reason to be someones favorite and I need that context for it to really ruin a date. (I might want to change topic though)"
10498,p8ai9l,3,Anything by Ayn Rand.
10499,p8ai9l,21,"Add Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Dinesh D'Souza and Ben Shapiro to the list. Also anything praising Trump as a God is out. I have some in-laws with some of these authors and I just want to wipe boogers in the pages."
10500,p8ai9l,36,"Charles Bukowski, Bret Easton Ellis, Ayn Rand or any book/author that shits on things like religion or political views. While I’m atheist myself, I really can’t stand books written by authors who constantly belittle theists or spiritualism (looking at you, Richard Dawkins)."
10501,p8ai9l,19,"John Waters once said if you went home with somebody, and they didn’t have any books, don’t fuck ‘em."
10502,p8ai9l,28,"No such thing as a deal breaker book. The deal breaker for me would some one who doesn't read, and sees no value in reading. A woman who reads, period, is far more appealing than one who doesn't. And, if we don't share the same tastes, it just means I might get turned on to something new."
10503,p8ai9l,3,"I probably wouldn't end a date if they liked anything by Andy Wier, but i would never trust a book recommendation from them."
10504,p8ai9l,10,"I understand the hate for Ayn Rand I think the bitch is crazy. But I have read most of her books and actually liked Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. And I couldn't be further from her philosophically and politically. 

Also I'm a guy who's read like 7 Dostoyevsky books and 0 Tolstoy. If I'm going to start reading Tolstoy where should I start?"
10505,p8ai9l,39,"Not all viewpoints are valid.

All have a right to be shared, but that doesn't mean all have a right to be respected.

Bad ideas and bad people should be called exactly that.

Silly ideas and silly people should be dismissed as such.

Wasting your time giving false legitimacy to a fool is not a good way to waste your time."
10506,p8ai9l,8,"Like others have said, books that conflict with my values. Unless they're a reviewer. I've actually never had a book be the line and probably never will. Because if I started dating again, One of my first questions would be to check if our non-negotiables line up."
10507,p8ai9l,11,Some of Jordan Peterson's work is pretty good. It's so annoying that his stuff gets grouped up with far-right ideologies because if you actually read his stuff it's not bad.
10508,p8ai9l,8,Yeah he gets smeared unnecessarily. In a weird way I'm glad he's being cast as super right wing (he's not) because he's at least exposing that part of society (which exists on both ends) to intelligent thought
10509,p8ai9l,11,"Paris Gellar summed it up nicely, “I’ve got one word for Kerouac - edit.”"
10510,p8ai9l,9,"Right there with you and prompts me to tell the story of how I ended up reading.

Years ago, I shared an office with my friend Kitty who was taking a community college English class that assigned The Alchemist. So she read it and they were discussing it in class and everyone in her class were tripping over themselves to declare how much the _LOVED_ it, it was so profound, and it totally changed their life, etc. And Kitty just didn't get it. So she was telling me this and she said 'they way they go on and on about it makes me worried that I'm dead inside or something'. So she asked me to read to reassure her that she wasn't imagining it and he was not in fact 'dead inside'.

Reader, she is in fact is not spiritually compromised as that book is a steaming pile of 💩. Omg, I _HATED_ that book. First of all - I'm a grown-ass person and I do not need to be reminded of your premise in every conversation. What really did me in was the ending. I mean, seriously? That was his personal journey?!?!

TL;DR - that book sucks."
10511,p8ai9l,13,It's a shame that all he's known for is his stance on mandatory gender pronouns. It's honestly ridiculous that people lose all interest for him based on his opinion on free speech.
10512,p8ai9l,7,Ayn Rand.
10513,p8ai9l,8,"Twilight. Just, no."
10514,p8ai9l,10,"I also think that [anything most of reddit specifically hates, I need upvotes] is a deal breaker."
10515,p8ai9l,4,"Catcher in the rye. Bro, I never hated a book so much ever. I absolutely regret every minute I spent reading it. The book is about the same length as the first Harry potter book. I finished that in a single day. I finished Catcher in The Rye in about a month"
10516,p8ai9l,3,“Resurrection” is amazing and not as overwhelmingly huge as e.g. War and Peace
10517,p8ai9l,3,Ohh but if you’re into bad books it’s hard to top 50 shades
10518,p8ai9l,4,j.k rowling 😅 while i love the harry potter series i absolutely do not support j.k rowling
10519,p8ai9l,3,"As a dude, I don’t really care for Twilight, but I think a lot of the hate it gets is unwarranted. Stephanie Meyer is a nice lady and her prose is about as complex as Hemingway (which is not very), but *he* gets lauded for using mostly two syllable words, too many semicolons and not owning a thesaurus. Some people like easy reads and Twilight is a very accessible series."
10520,p8ai9l,12,Very shallow and surface level reading of it
10521,p8ai9l,18,That’s ridiculous.  You just said they’re fantastic books!
10522,p8ai9l,9,"I hated *Catcher in the Rye* too, but it wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me. I'd be interested in what they found in it that I didn't.

If they say *The Secret*, though...we're done."
10523,p8ai9l,58,James Patterson. He has a team of writers that do the work for him while he profits. Total garbage.
10524,p8ai9l,24,"So I love Tolstoy, but (as perhaps you can tell from my user name) I’m team Dostoevsky all the way! Though if I’m on a date and my date is familiar enough with Russian lit to have an opinion on Tolstoy vs. Dostoevsky, I’ll count that as a big plus, no matter which side they come down on."
10525,p8ai9l,6,"Wait, why? It’s a really good book."
10526,p8ai9l,5,Because she only ever wanted to eat pickles and donuts for every meal.
10527,p8ai9l,7,It has the same issue as On The Road in the sense that it was hugely popular for a particular time period but hasn't aged well. I think if you were a teenage or 20-something gen x-er when it came out you probably loved it but reading it today is not the same.
10528,p8ai9l,3,[deleted]

10534,p8ai9l,4,"Agreed!  I'm easily a DFW fangirl.

*Ready Player One* is an okay book.  I enjoyed it but *favourite* is a stretch - mainly tells me that the person loves 80s movies."
10535,p8ai9l,3,"I loved it in high school and I still think it’s a great book. The protagonist is suffering from alienation and a lack of meaning that’s very common in American culture. I haven’t read it in a long time, and I certainly understand hating the character of HC though."

Half the books read like script of a low budget movie or may that is there ultimate goal. I bought a book by Mandar Kokate at a train station (it was tagged ""national best seller""- got me curious) and not surprisingly, it was soooo bad that I left it sitting on my seat, hoping that it would find someone it was meant to be - was a national best seller after all.."
10541,p8ai9l,3,"I read On The Road  during a four day impromptu camping trip and loved it. My girlfriend (now wife) and I packed the car and drove around the southern interior of B.C.  camping in a new location each night. I can't remember why, but we seemed to be fighting a lot at that time in our relationship, and I think this is one reason why I loved the book. We were on the move, emotions were high, we barely slept  we drove a few hours every day to a new campsite in a fresh locale.   Kerouac's writing style seemed to mirror how I felt at the time: excited and anxious. Constantly on the move, frenetic. 

Now whenever I think of that book, I have amazing memories of those four crazy summer days 20 years ago. 

Also loved Desolation Angels...."
10542,p8ai9l,9,"Why does everyone hate The Catcher in the Rye? Granted, I read Salinger’s short stories first so I was used to his style..."

10544,p8ai9l,4,"And if it was me, being familiar with Dawkins is a huge plus.

I grew up very religious, so people who acknowledge and don't tolerate the harm religion causes is something I prefer."
10545,p8ai9l,3,Why Shakespeare?
10546,p8ai9l,13,"Honestly I don’t hate the book. Even though most people read it at the high school level, I think it would be really interesting to read it through different critical lenses at the college level. 

Not everyone has an English degree or is interested in analyzing literature like I am, some people just read for pleasure, which is totally cool too. In my experience, men who say their favorite book is The Catcher in the Rye say so because they identify too closely with Holden and completely disregard all of his character flaws. Especially when they don’t even mention/remember all of the sexist and homophobic things Holden says throughout the book. It just gives me the vibe that they have a victim and superiority complex at the same time. I don’t mean to sound pretentious but I don’t think a lot of people can accurately explain why CITR is a coming of age novel, they just think it’s about some kid who like, goes against the grain and sees how “phoney” the world is."
10547,p8ai9l,10,"This post gets reuploaded every week so everyone can circle-jerk about how much they hate Ayn Rand, Bukowski, and any author that has a hint of right wing views"
10548,p8ai9l,9,It’s just the whining of a teenager for 300 pages
10549,p8ai9l,9,"Is this for both fiction and nonfiction?, and where can I read about it?"
10550,p8ai9l,6,"I loved the alchemist, but I read it in 8th grade so IDK"
10551,p8ai9l,10,Far worse. Its the indian version of Ebola.

10553,p8ai9l,5,wait you like good kind?
10554,p8ai9l,9,"I grew up muslim. Where I’m from, leaving Islam warrants the death penalty (stoning and firing squads are very common for apostates), and my country is under a theocracy. I’ve also experienced sexual assault under religion as a child. Trust me, I totally get the religious trauma and I feel for you. I’m glad you have Dawkins to look up to, but a lot of his “anti-theological” arguments just don’t sit right with me. I much prefer Bertrand Russell or Friedrich Nietzsche to Dawkins because their argument focuses more on disproving the existence of god and less on belittling theists. Totally valid if you think otherwise. Hopefully we can all heal from religious trauma and raise future generations to be more tolerant and accepting."
10555,p8ai9l,15,"Presumably some of his early work is his own, but he hasn’t really written in years. Here is a good article about it.

10558,p8ai9l,4,"I’m not against religion, but The Bible.  Or The Koran.  Any religion where women are supposed to “be modest”, have many children, and let the man make all the decisions.

I grew up in a place like that and it is the worst feeling for a girl to have her ideas and work dismissed because of gender (I made a frigging awesome tall wooden feed trough for chickens as a school project - I measured and sawed and nailed, all to have the boys make fun of it and me - it’s disheartening to live in that environment).

Another author that would be a turn off would be anyone who writes the “ten easy steps to be a better person”, or stuff like that.  A guy I used to know said several inspirational things.  I complimented him on these thoughts and he was so proud of himself.  Later, he gave me some books to read that he liked, and in every one of them, there were these sayings that *he took credit for*."
10559,p8ai9l,5,I think you have that a little backwards. He became popular because he was against the idea of pronoun use being written into Canadian legislature in such a way that you could face legal repercussions for not using the pronouns that people identify with. So technically he was against mandatory gender pronouns.
10560,p8ai9l,5,"I think you could add some of Roy, Adiga, Desai and Murti to the list.. I have also read a fiction from tharoor (the great Indian novel) and I actually kinda liked it!"
10561,p8ai9l,3,Add to the good list or bad? Coz i read Arundhati roy and i liked her books. I dont know about Adiga or Desai.
10562,p8ai9l,3,Good god lemon.
10563,p8ai9l,5,"Good list of course.. Arvind Adiga's ""The White Tiger"" was really something, right now I am reading his ""Between the assassinations"" that I received yesterday and it has a strong start hoping it won't disappoint. Fingers crossed


Both Anita and Kiran Desai has penned down some fantabulous books, start with Anita Desai's Fire on the mountain (it's a short book with a little over 150 pages) I have a feeling that you might like it.."
10564,p8ai9l,3,"Oh I definitely see where you’re coming from. For me, I’ve dated people who exclusively worship Dawkins or Jordan Peterson and they just came off as pseudo-intellectual assholes who think they’re intellectually superior just because they’re atheists and it becomes they’re only defining trait while also (ironically) treating science as a dogma. I do agree that having someone who you can freely engage in discussion with is a great thing.

I’m sorry to hear that you’ve had some terrible experiences with relationships as a result of your religious upbringing. Hopefully you’re doing much better now ❤️."
10565,p8ai9l,4,"I like Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, her most famous Palace of Illusions and not so famous The Forest of Enchantments.
You also have authors like Amish Tripathi and his meluha triology (not sure of the new triology)
I have read Chanakya's Chants by Sanghi and I liked it but to be honest it was a long time ago so I'm not sure about his more recent books.
Chetan Bhagat is for those who want to begin reading and he legit has 2 good books according to me so I don't disagree that he is not worth reading for avid readers."
10566,p8ai9l,6,"Exactly! This didn’t happen on a date, but with a new-ish colleague at work: I said I was considering getting a library card. I always get one for the city I’m currently in, but so far I don’t have one for the city where we both work, and it’s not cheap so I’m hesitating. She replied: „What, library? You read THAT much?“ I said no, not even that much, but I like reading books on my commute by train. She said „I‘d rather sleep on the train!“, and that was the moment when I knew we’re quite different people. Nice colleague for sure, but probably won’t be my best friend for life."
10567,p8ai9l,23,"He is one of the good guys, though. The fact he is open about the fact and credits his co-writers on his books is HUGE. The amount he does for charity cements it."
10568,p8ai9l,3,"i like the catcher in the rye, but it’s a red flag due to the type of people that heavily relate to Holden. 

Mark David Chapman, Lee Harvey Oswald, and John Warnock Hinckley are just some of the names who had either been reading the catcher in the rye before doing what they did, or they idolized holden."
10569,p8ai9l,3,"I swear I am the most non-judgemental person you'll ever meet but if you tell me you like Chetan Bhagat's books so much that it's one of your favvs.

It's done then and there."
10570,p8ai9l,3,"As there are many anti-authoritarian books (We, Foundation Pit, Life and Fate…) that don’t include one dimensional women I stand by my opinion. Also if they can not blink at the misogyny then we won’t be compatible."
10571,p8ai9l,4,"You haven't read anything on Peterson clearly, because you've gotten the complete opposite idea of his points, I'm not sure whyd you comment on someone you obviously know nothing about."
10572,p8ai9l,3,"Haha. In college i had met ppl who were like, ""i read books. Books are my life. How can one not read books!!"". Then i asked them their fav books. Durjoy Dutta, Preeti Shenoy, Chetan Bhagat. 😂😂😂😂"
10573,p8ai9l,3,"Edit: sorry for the long answer but here goes: 

My entire reaction to Dawkins is “you’re right and I agree with you but you don’t have to be an ass about it”. Many times throughout the God Delusion I recalled him being very immature and belittling theists which, I argue, is weak philosophy. You can argue the anti-theist point of view without questioning the intelligence of people who choose to believe in a higher power. In many of my philosophy classes in UG, I came across many academics who are a lot more competent with providing clear cut, strong and well developed arguments around the existence of gods without having to rely on sensationalization and insulting millions. If I had to create an analogy, Richard Dawkins is to philosophy what Neil DeGrasse Tyson is to science. 

I do like books with arguments against god like God Is Not Great by Hitchens, and after reading the God Delusion, I appreciated Hitchens a lot more. His books is a lot more comprehensive and well put together. Dawkins just reads like a jaded, edgy grad school student’s first attempt at writing on the philosophy of religion. 

As for authors who channel their religious beliefs into books? I haven’t read many (besides LOTR I guess) so I can’t tell you. I imagine I would have the same response as I do to Dawkins if said author insults those who don’t share the same religious beliefs as them. 

They’re allowed to incorporate whatever they want, I really don’t care but I don’t have to read it."
10574,p8ai9l,3,No he was against mandatory gender pronouns. Sorry that I worded that so poorly. And he put himself in the hospital because he stopped taking his anxiety meds.

Personally I love non fiction spionage stories, and Ben McIntyre is unbeaten in this regard, e.g. check out The Spy and the Traitor. My favourite narrative non-fiction is by the hand of Hampton Sides, who has written books in various settings, e.g. The Wild West (Blood &amp; Thunder) and polar exploration (In the Kingdom of Ice).

Some more personal narrative non fiction favourites:
- Batavia's Graveyard (shipwreck in the 17th century) 
- Into Thin Area (mountain climbing)
- All the Shah's Men (US coup in Iran)
- Shadow Divers (deep sea diving) 
- American Kingpin (Silk Road)

&gt;The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.

&gt;In December 1972, Jean McConville, a thirty-eight-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.
&gt;
&gt;Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders.
&gt;
&gt;Patrick Radden Keefe writes an intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussions.

&gt;For those who could read between the lines, the censored news out of China was terrifying. But the president insisted there was nothing to worry about.
&gt;
&gt;Fortunately, we are still a nation of skeptics. Fortunately, there are those among us who study pandemics and are willing to look unflinchingly at worst-case scenarios. Michael Lewis’s taut and brilliant nonfiction thriller pits a band of medical visionaries against the wall of ignorance that was the official response of the Trump administration to the outbreak of COVID-19.
&gt;
&gt;The characters you will meet in these pages are as fascinating as they are unexpected. A thirteen-year-old girl’s science project on transmission of an airborne pathogen develops into a very grown-up model of disease control. A local public-health officer uses her worm’s-eye view to see what the CDC misses, and reveals great truths about American society. A secret team of dissenting doctors, nicknamed the Wolverines, has everything necessary to fight the pandemic: brilliant backgrounds, world-class labs, prior experience with the pandemic scares of bird flu and swine flu…everything, that is, except official permission to implement their work.
&gt;
&gt;Michael Lewis is not shy about calling these people heroes for their refusal to follow directives that they know to be based on misinformation and bad science. Even the internet, as crucial as it is to their exchange of ideas, poses a risk to them. They never know for sure who else might be listening in.

&gt;Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.
&gt;
&gt;Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. 
&gt;
&gt;Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.
&gt;
&gt;The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.

&gt;NAMED A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2017#1 New York Times and #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller! 
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;A Best Book of 2017 from the Boston Globe
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;One of the 12 Best Books of the Year from National Geographic
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;Included in Lithub's Ultimate Best Books of 2017 List
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;A Favorite Science Book of 2017 from Science News
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A five-hundred-year-old legend. An ancient curse. A stunning medical mystery. And a pioneering journey into the unknown heart of the world's densest jungle.
&gt;
&gt;Since the days of conquistador Hernán Cortés, rumors have circulated about a lost city of immense wealth hidden somewhere in the Honduran interior, called the White City or the Lost City of the Monkey God. Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.

[**1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491)

^(By: Charles C. Mann | 541 pages | Published: 2005 | Popular Shelves: history, non-fiction, nonfiction, american-history, anthropology | )[^(Search ""1491"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=1491&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;In this groundbreaking work of science, history, and archaeology, Charles C. Mann radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus in 1492.
&gt;
&gt;Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school, the pre-Columbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness; rather, there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them. The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets, and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man’s first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed, Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand. Challenging and surprising, this a transformative new look at a rich and fascinating world we only thought we knew.

[**The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158542-the-boys-in-the-boat)

^(By: Daniel James Brown | 404 pages | Published: 2013 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, history, book-club, nonfiction, sports | )[^(Search ""The Boys in the Boat"")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The Boys in the Boat&amp;search_type=books)

&gt;For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics.Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs.

10689,p8b8cv,3,"Little bit dated at this point, but I don't think All the President's Men by Woodward and Bernstein has been suggested yet. Really does read like a political thriller, or something along the lines of the movie Spotlight.

10692,p8b8cv,3,"The Hot Zone and the sport-of sequel, Crisis in the Red Zone. They read like novels and ate terrifying accounts of Ebola outbreaks."
10693,p8b8cv,15,If you read Into Thin Air and get a little invested in the story you should absolutely read The Climb by Anatoli Boukreev. Same events told from a different and very important party involved that gives a very different perspective.

10698,p8b8cv,4,"I absolutely love ""Say nothing"" and if you consume it as an audio book, it will be that much better when the narrator is someone from Northern Ireland. This is such a powerful and eye opening book. I cannot recommend it enough. Thank you for writing it in the comments!!"
10699,p8b8cv,4,"This is great thread with excellent suggestions.

My little contribution to this is Middlesex of jeffrey Eygenides. The actual history on this is about the disaster in Smyrna, the refugee to Greece of two siblings that later they migrated to USA. Then it shows the next 2-3 generations and some major events in the country such as the riots in Bronx.

It won the Pulitzer because of that story and its decorated with a very interesting and touching fictional story about a man who was born with hidden genitals and was raised as a girl.

&gt;Atticus O’Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old—when in actuality, he’s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he’s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power—plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish—to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.

10768,p8vmie,59,"If you like Discworld, then the Watch series. Sam Vimes goes through an absolute transformation. It's quite hard to remember that he starts off being (that world's version of) racist and sexist, and seeing his character growth is honestly beautiful. For me the pinnacle was Night Watch. The Watch series particularly features male and female characters with a lot of depth. 

If you like Star Wars, I also recommend Timothy Zahn's Thrawn series. Lots of very strong male characters there, not just the main cast but ones like Talon Karrde and Captain Pellaeon (who is a villain but also undergoes a lot of character development)."

He cares about people and tries hard, if kind of strangely, to show his love (for the ones he knows personally) and his compassion (for the ones he doesn't). He's curious and enthusiastic about life. He has meaningful though imperfect relationships, and engrossing hobbies. And he loves kittens.

&gt;
&gt;His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that's been cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled into the depths of space, it's up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.
&gt;
&gt;And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have a chance.

&gt;Jamaica in 1665 is a rough outpost of the English crown, a minor colony holding out against the vast supremacy of the Spanish empire. Port Royal, Jamaica′s capital, a cut-throat town of taverns, grog shops, and bawdy houses, is devoid of London′s luxuries; life here can end swiftly with dysentery or a dagger in your back. But for Captain Charles Hunter it is a life that can also lead to riches, if he abides by the island′s code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.
&gt;
&gt;Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV himself. With the governor′s backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the island′s shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.
&gt;
&gt;With the help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake. But his troubles have just begun. . . .

10819,pthhi7,3,Great suggestions!
10820,pthhi7,19,"{{Ben-Hur}}, by Lew Wallace, is a revenge epic you might like, with the caveat that it carries a strong religious message, for better or worse.  FWIW I’m an atheist, but I still like it.

Or stick with Dumas and read {{The Three Musketeers}} or any of the wonderful books that u/maroon_sweater recommended.

Edit- I invited the goodreads bot to provide a squib on Ben-Hur and was surprised and a bit annoyed at what it said.  I think of it as a revenge and redemption story.  Yes, it carries a religious message, but the squib makes it sound like it’s a retelling of the New Testament, and it’s nothing of the sort."

&gt;Alexandre Dumas’s most famous tale— and possibly the most famous historical novel of all time— in a handsome hardcover volume.
&gt;
&gt;This swashbuckling epic of chivalry, honor, and derring-do, set in France during the 1620s, is richly populated with romantic heroes, unattainable heroines, kings, queens, cavaliers, and criminals in a whirl of adventure, espionage, conspiracy, murder, vengeance, love, scandal, and suspense. Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d’Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress “Milady”; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen—and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto “all for one, one for all” has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, The Three Musketeers is eternally entertaining.

10828,pthhi7,16,"You might be interested in reading The Black Count. It’s a biography of Dumas’ father, General Alex Dumas.

From Goodreads:

&gt;	Born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), Alex Dumas was briefly sold into bondage but made his way to Paris where he was schooled as a sword-fighting member of the French aristocracy. Enlisting as a private, he rose to command armies at the height of the Revolution in an audacious campaign across Europe and the Middle East – until he met an implacable enemy he could not defeat."

10854,pthhi7,4,"This is a solid recommendation and the Flashman books are snappily-written, historically well-researched and cunningly plot-keyed into action classics that preceded them...

So, what's the 'but'? Flashman's all-round awfulness extends, in the first book, to what even he admits is a rape (I haven't read them all, but I'm pretty sure this never happens again in the series, the first of which came out in 1969). Flash is an out-and-out antihero, but even though rape *was* treated casually at the time at which the book is set (mostly the 1840's), it's hard for a modern-day reader to root for a rapist.

Does this make the Flashman books not worth reading? Absolutely not, Flash is a terrible excuse for a human, and that's the point of these entertaining tales; George MacDonald Fraser took care to make him do at least one thing that would 100% lose the reader's sympathy per book. But one of the worst things he does happens about a third of the way into the first book, and it was a bit of a jolt even though I'd read a number of the later ones first."

&gt;Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.

10912,q1wr78,3,"There's Loiosh in **Steven Brust**'s Vlad Taltos subseries of his Dragaera fantasy universe, starring a human assassin witch who's an ethnic minority in a sorcerous empire dominated by long-lived elf-like people. He's the witch familiar and a jhereg (a kind of shoulder-sitting mini-wyvern) and he's intelligent and psychically speaks with Vlad reasonably often throughout all the books. They're almost all 1st person snarker POV (and they're also done in a variety of literary styles), so YMMV if you'll like the narrative voice.

One novel, _Athyra_, is done partially from the POV of Loiosh's mate Rocza and also that of a Dragaeran peasant teenager for whom Vlad is the exotic stranger passing through his farm village. The books are written at various points up and down Vlad's timeline, so you don't have to read them in strict order, but it does help to read the first 5 or so by publication date to establish some early events with fallout that significantly affects the rest (there's a couple of omnibus editions which group them handily, starting with _The Book of Jhereg_).

For animal companionship in reverse, maybe you'd like **Diane Duane**'s Feline Wizards series starting with _The Book of Night With Moon_? It's an adult-level spinoff of her YA Young Wizards contemporary fantasy series, starring cat wizards mostly in New York City and there's a lot of attention paid to creating a separate feline society with its own language and customs.

The main character is Rhiow, who's the housecat pet of ordinary humans who have no idea what she is (she got offered the wizardry after being raised by one of them from kittenhood), and she has to juggle her profession and her personal life kind of like a superhero with a secret identity. While they don't show up a lot, “Hhuha” and “Iaehh” (Susan and Mike) are fairly significant in recurring scenes throughout the 1st &amp; 2nd books (3rd book is an adventure to someplace else, but it's got prominent appearances by classic Broadway story author &gt;!Damon Runyon!&lt; as the “pet” of another cat).

It's an older series from Ace Books in the 1990s with no ebook reprints yet, but fun if you like light comedy, so maybe you might find in a used bookshop **Esther M. Friesner**'s Majyk trilogy starting with _Majyk by Accident_. These are portal fantasy to a silly magical world called Orbix, where the least talented apprentice Kendar unexpectedly acquires an amazing hoard of magical power making him the most powerful wizard out there. And also an ordinary cat from Earth named Scandal comes in through a magical mousehole where he acquires the usual powers that the locals attribute to cats which are rare legendary creatures there (being able to steal breath, talk, and permitted to look directly at kings).

Scandal is the obligatory irreverently snarky, not-understood-by-the-locals pop culture reference-dropping older and wiser and more sarcastic guide to helping Kendar cope with his new situation and all the stuff that comes up to him because of it (including a barbarian swordsman afflicted with the curse of cuteness and Tolkien-parody “Welfies” from the Fearsome Forest of Euw). He doesn't have that high an opinion of the naïve Kendar at first, but they grow on each other, and he's one of the major supports against the other challenges.

A bit of a twist on the companionship, but there's an ebook reprint available which sometimes goes on sale really cheap for **Carolyn Cushman**'s 1990s-era standalone portal fantasy _Witch and Wombat_, which is a fun adventure romp where a more-or-less traditional magical world thrives on contact with the mundane world, and thus to boost their energy, they're planning to present it as a hyper-realistic virtual reality simulation for gamers, with one test group being hosted and going through the usual fairy-tale derived starter adventures until things get more complicated.

Their tour guides are the witch Hali and her familiar Bernie, who's a talking ~~raven~~ crow who used to be a human pickpocket/mugger in an Earth city who made the mistake of targeting the visiting Hali on the subway, and got turned into a bird and stuffed into her purse for his troubles, as he relates to the gamer group. But he spends most of the story as a wombat, since management has decided that they're a trendier and more marketable critter for the tie-in toy line. Interestingly enough, when he gets the chance to transform back, he chooses &gt;!to become a raven again instead of a human!&lt;. And there's another character who gets transformed into a different animal for much of the journey because reasons.

ETA: I notice someone recommended **Barbara Hambly**'s _Dragonsbane_ upthread, which is quite good, even if not quite what the request is looking for. She's got another you might want to try, the standalone historical urban fantasy/horror _Bride of the Rat God_, set in 1920s Hollywood with a silent film star who's come under a curse, and has the aid of her three dogs, Chang Ming, Buttercreme, and Black Jasmine, who are Pekingese whose ancestors were bred to deal with demons. It's got a nice mix of period atmosphere with slice of life amidst the adventurous parts and the animals being more in the background, but also key to a bunch of stuff, a bit like Connie Willis' _To Say Nothing of the Dog_."

10930,q1yrx3,3,Scythe series by Neil Shusterman
10931,q1yrx3,3,"It inspired 1984 and Orwell believed Huxley heavily copied from it in writing BMW, we he obviously did if you read the two."
10932,q1yrx3,5,"It has a good sequel too, The Testaments. I’d definitely recommend both."
10933,q1yrx3,3,I actually completely forgot about A Clockwork Orange. I definitely need to add that to the list. Thanks for the reminder! I'll definitely be sure to check out the other one as well.
10934,q1yrx3,3,Queen of the Tearling trilogy. Takes a Fastic sting dystopian angle at three different kinds of societies along the same timeline. Plus awesome characters and realistic combat (the author doesn’t glorify war by washing out all the gore). Plus it’s just fun once you figure out what’s happening!
10935,q1yrx3,3,"It is a great book, but it is not dystopian. I do love Pelevin, and would recommend almost everything he’s written, but his books I think is entire ‘Pelevin’ genre."
10936,q1yrx3,9,"*The Power* by Naomi Alderman. It's like a reverse Handmaid's Tale. It's dark but gripping. What happens to society when girls are granted a power to kill at puberty. Multiple viewpoints make this one a great read.

*Blackfish City* is an interesting take on dystopia.  Post climate disaster, a huge floating city filled with classism doesn't know what to do when rumors of a mysterious woman riding a killer whale starts circulating.  Some cool moments and inspired by Inuit fokelore. 

*The Passage* is an excellent horror series that deals with life before and after a world altering cataclysm. Has some grounded characters and some interesting relationships. Jumps from pre-event to post-event and connects some cool dots by doing this.

*Scythe* is a cool YA series that features a world where death has been ""cured"" and science has basically created a Utopia.  In order to keep with the balance of life, people are tasked with becoming Grim Reaper style ""Scythes"" that cull the population and keep overpopulation from being an issue.  Entertaining and dark, and much better written than a lot of YA books out there.

*The Electric Kingdom* just came out and is a post-apocolytic YA book that features a young girl trying to track down the origins of a mysterious ""fairy tale."" Took me a while to get into it, but has some interesting twists and setting. Like a lighter Blake Crouch.

N.K. Jemisin's *Broken Earth* series took the Hugos by storm in recent years with all three books winning best novel of the year in their respective years. It's very well loved by modern fantasy/sci-fi readers.

Parable Of The Sower is considered one of the best dystopian books ever written. Bleak, jaw dropping, horrifying book that is a bit too ""close to home."" So beautifully written but so painful to get through, this story ends up being one of the most tearfully scary horror reads I've encountered without actually being marketed as a horror book. Avoid if current events have made you anxious, one of the few dystopian books you can actually see happening."

10938,q1yrx3,4,"Station 11. Handmaid’s take.

I was just reading Parable of the Sower - which is tbh too rapey for me - but a lot of people really really like it."
10939,q1yrx3,4,Cosigned. Newsflesh is such an underrated series. Which is a shame because it takes (imo) a far more interesting approach to the zombie apocalypse than most of the zombie stories getting all the attention these days.
10940,q1yrx3,4,I’m 2/3rds of the way through the first one and it hasn’t had anything to do with a pandemic or that senator yet. It’s more accurate to describe it as a dystopia of water and housing scarcity.
10941,q1yrx3,8,"The Disposessed by Ursula Le Guin has elements of utopian/dystopian ficiton. 

In addition to The Handmaid's Tale and Maddaddam books by Margaret Atwood, she wrote The Heart Goes Last. 

John Christopher wrote The Death of Grass and The Tripods

The Dream Master by Roger Zelazney"
10942,q1yrx3,3,Octavia Butler is in many ways a more gifted horror writer than the sci-fi writer she’s generally described as. Kindred was easily one of the scariest books I’ve ever read and I’m white so I can’t even imagine how much more horrifying it would be for a black person to read.

10974,q1zhz5,449,"Okay, I'll give you must-reads only. There are a lot of other wonderful fantasy books I could recommend, but these are the basics for being a well-read fantasy fan. These are older books, so the odds are excellent that at least some of them will be new to you.

Of course J. R. R. Tolkien's {{The Hobbit}} and {{The Lord of the Rings}} essentially created the modern genre of fantasy. There's a reason for that: they're incredible books.

{{Bridge of Birds}} by Barry Hughart is the first of three books in that series, and it won the World Fantasy Award in 1985. Set in ""an ancient China that never was"", it's the story of a young peasant man who's as strong as an ox, and an ancient sage with a slight flaw in his character. It draws on Chinese folk tales and history, as well as a bit of Sherlock Holmes. It's a mystery with magic, humor, adventure, and it's simply mind-blowing.

Steven Brust is quite possibly the best fantasy author currently living. His _Vlad Taltos_ series is gritty high-fantasy; magical resurrection is common, though expensive, and psionic communication is almost as common as cell phones are in our world. At the same time it has a strong Sopranos flavor. The protagonist starts as an assassin and minor crime boss, a despised human in an Empire of elves. It starts with {{Jhereg}}. I've introduced a lot of friends to that series, and every single one of them has loved it.

He also wrote a parallel series in the style of Alexander Dumas, set in the same universe: _The Khaavren Romances_. Those books are considerably thicker, and the language is practically baroque - but fun, if you like Dumas.

The _Sun Wolf and Starhawk_ series by Barbara Hambly starts with {{The Ladies of Mandrigyn}}. It's sophisticated and gripping fantasy that’s quite intense, but not overbearing; the first book in particular presents interesting insights on men and women, without being preachy or simplistic. Strongly recommended.

Patricia McKillip's [The Forgotten Beasts of Eld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forgotten_Beasts_of_Eld) is simply magical. It's an elegant, evocative fantasy that will probably stick in your mind forever. It won the World Fantasy Award in 1975.

Try {{A Fine and Private Place}} by Peter S. Beagle. It's the story of a man (a modern man) who lives in a cemetery where he witnesses (and helps facilitate) love between ghosts. It's very memorable and different. Beagle is most famous for writing {{The Last Unicorn}}, which is also an amazing and unique book filled with poetry.

Roger Zelazny's {{The Chronicles of Amber}} series is one of the most popular fantasy series ever written. It's about a royal family of people from the ultimate reality who have the ability to travel from world to world and probability to probability, including modern Earth. Scheming and plotting by royal siblings to take the throne forms the core of the series, and it was published **decades** before _A Game of Thrones_! The first book in the series is {{Nine Princes In Amber}}.

Look up the works of Lord Dunsany. He was an early pioneer in the field of fantasy, and a major early influence on H. P. Lovecraft; his stories and plays have a fairy-tale quality that's mesmerizing. And most of his works are now in the public domain, and available for [free from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/2685). I would recommend starting with [The Book Of Wonder](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7477), [A Dreamer's Tales](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/57277), or [Fifty-One Tales](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838).

Michael Moorcock's _Eternal Champion_ series' - plural, he wrote a number of different series based on different incarnations of The Eternal Champion - were groundbreaking. They introduced the dark antihero to modern fantasy. I'd suggest starting with {{Elric of Melniboné}}. Taken as a whole, the _Eternal Champion_ series consist of **several dozen** books - although most of them are relatively short, in the 180 - 220-page range.

Robert E. Howard's [Conan the Barbarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian?wprov=sfla1) broke new ground in the field of fantasy: dark, gritty, with a protagonist who was a virtual killing machine. Yet the stories have a raw, fierce electricity to them. They're **gripping**. They shouldn't be missed.

Fritz Leiber's _Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser_ series, starting with {{Swords and Deviltry}}, are classics of the genre. They're set in a world that’s a bit darker and more primitive-feeling than most modern fantasy, featuring an archetypal pair of adventurers. They’re very well written.

Mary Stewart's Merlin books, beginning with {{The Crystal Cave}}, are much less ""fantastic"" then any other Arthurian fiction that I can think of - and I mean that in a _good_ way. The writing is enchanting (no pun intended), with a different take on the theme. I would definitely recommend them.

Steven Brust's {{To Reign In Hell}} has the honor of being the most frequently-stolen (i.e. borrowed and never returned) book in my collection. It's one of his earlier novels, a stand-alone that retells the Judeo-Christian story of the creation of Heaven, Earth, and Hell from a very different viewpoint. It's extremely clever, funny, and imaginative. You'll have to get your own copy, though, because mine isn't available for borrowing any more.

If a darker book doesn't bother you, you might like James Blish's novel {{The Devil's Day}}, which was first broken up into two books and published as _Black Easter_ and _The Day After Judgement_. The book(s) are unique; Blish researched actual medieval grimoires, and the magic in the book is therefore actually historically accurate! It's a very philosophical work, which doesn't mean that it's boring. The setting is effectively modern, technically near-future. An international arms dealer hires a black magician to release all the demons of Hell for a single night, just out of boredom. Things don't go _quite_ as planned.

I'd also recommend T.H. White's [The Once and Future King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Once_and_Future_King?wprov=sfla1), of course. It's a classic, and a wonderful book.

[James Branch Cabell](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/166) was an early author in the field of fantasy, and was generally considered to be ""shocking"". His novel _Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice_ was denounced as indecent, banned in Boston, and the subject of an obscenity trial -  although by modern standards it's relatively tame. Many of his works are available for free on Project Gutenberg at the link above.

There’s also Glenn Cook's {{The Black Company}} series. That series took a major step forward in creating the modern genre of dark fantasy. It's well worth a read.

The [Harold Shea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Shea?wprov=sfla1) series by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt is classic humorous fantasy. Professor Shea and his friends discover a way to travel to alternate realities based on mythology and stories. It's a lot of fun.

Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ series is a classic of humorous fantasy. You might start with {{Guards! Guards!}}.

There's always Bram Stoker's [Dracula](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345), which is free in many formats on Project Gutenberg. Apparently Stoker also wrote a sequel called [Dracula's Ghost](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10150), but I haven't read it.

C. L. Moore's [Jirel of Joiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirel_of_Joiry?wprov=sfla1) stories were the first fantasy series featuring a strong female protagonist.

[The October Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_October_Country?wprov=sfla1) is a collection of dark short stories by Ray Bradbury. I found ""Skeleton"" _particularly_ memorable.

**Note**: although I've used the GoodReads link option to include information about the books, GoodReads is owned by Amazon. Please consider patronizing your local independent book shops instead; they can order books for you that they don't have in stock.

And of course there's always your local library. If they don't have a book, they may be able to get it for you via inter-library loan.

If you'd rather order direct online, Thriftbooks and Powell's Books are good. You might also check libraries in your general area; most of them sell books at very low prices to raise funds. I've made some great finds at library book sales! And for used books, Biblio.com and Bookshop.org are independent book marketplaces that serve independent book shops - NOT Amazon."

10992,q1zhz5,74,"Yep, just a few essentials... ;)"
10993,q1zhz5,19,"Must read fantasy novels, as far as I'm concerned. Leaving out those you mentioned.

- **Neverwhere** by Neil Gaiman

- **The Ocean at the End of the Lane** by Neil Gaiman

- **Assassin's Apprentice** by Robin Hobb (and likely the rest of the Farseer trilogy, I'm stuck having only read the first because the second is sold out everywhere)

- **Circe** by Madeline Miller

- **The Hunger Games** trilogy by Suzanne Collins (but skip the prequel, it's dreadful)

- **Peter Pan** by J.M. Barrie, when you're in the mood for something light and whimsical - written for kids."
10994,q1zhz5,8,I was looking for Discworld.
10995,q1zhz5,7,Thanks for the recommendations! Assassin’s Apprentice has been recommended a couple times and I’ll probably check that out.

*Edit - remembered forgotten things..."
11002,q1zhz5,8,"It's my favorite fantasy trilogy. I think it's *very* underrated. GRRM himself [said](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams):

&gt; The Dragonbone Chair and the rest of his famous four-book trilogy [were some] of the things that inspired me to write my own seven-book trilogy. Fantasy got a bad rep for being formulaic and ritual. And I read The Dragonbone Chair and said, 'My God, they can do something with this form, and it’s Tad doing it.'

11003,q1zhz5,10,"I can't recommend **Assassin's Apprentice** enough! I read it last week and it has been constantly on my mind ever since.

**Circe** is great and has a different feel than **The Song of Achilles**. Well worth a shot!"
11004,q1zhz5,36,"Wheel of Time and Discworld are also considered required reading by many people.  Same for Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson although its a really hard read.  This next one is pop fiction, but still a darn good fantasy series that was VERY impactful in the genre, but RA Salvatore's Legend of Drizzt books, easy to pick up, fun to read, and started a lot of tropes you see in fantasy today.  Robin Hobb is also great if you like interesting worlds, I'd recommend starting with the Rainwilde Chronicles, followed by Liveship Traders, but her stories get kinda dark sometimes.  Still, Dune, Song of Ice and Fire, and LoTR also get dark, so I doubt that'll be an issue.  These are YA, but the Eragon books by Paloni are also fantastic fantasy books, and as the series moves on it gets chunkier and less YA and more into plain adult fantasy.  The Crystal Cave is a 1970 fantasy novel by Mary Stewart, and you don't see it mentioned much anymore, but its a really solid fantasy series that shaped the genre more than people seem to realize these days.  In fact, a lot of older books are kind of ignored in favor of books written post 2006, the sort of pre-harry potter days;  A Wizard of Earthsea, Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey, The Once and Future King by TH White, The King of Elfland's Daughter by Lord Dunsany, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, and The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander are all much older and overlooked these days despite being classics of fantasy.

Its not required reading, but if you like Sanderson and Name of the Wind, try Brent Weeks ""The Black Prism"" pretty good series that feels kind of Sanderson-y in style.  Same goes for the Gentleman Bastard series by Scott Lynch, starting with The Lies of Locke Lamora.  This is starting to get disorganized so I'm gonna make a little list with a few notes to make it easy for people who don't want to read 4 paragraphs.

# Sanderson-esque (modern and approachable)

**The Black Prism - Brent Weeks** (Colors of light are used for magic, political games and religion ensue)  
**Gentleman Bastards - Scott Lynch** (heist books about a gang of ruffians in a magical venice type city)  
**The Last Stormlord - Glenda Larke** (waterbenders living in a desert, the last strong one died and now they're dying of thirst, causing infighting and war)  
**Eragon - Chrisopher Paloni** (Star Wars but Dragons.  Farm boy finds dragon, mentor takes him in, take down the dark lord.  YA but really well written, don't write it off)  
**Legend of Drizzt - RA Salvatore** (everyone knows it, its a little older now, but a classic in modern fantasy.  Dark Elf who isn't a bastard, and his struggles to fit in on the surface.  Good adventure stories.  Like popcorn or french fries.)

Honorable Mention: **His Dark Materials - Philip Pullman** (they call this a YA book, but man it gets complicated.  This follows a young girl named Lyra as she traverses some REALLY interesting fantasy worlds.)

# Serious Fantasy (difficult at times but worth the read)

**Wheel of Time - Robert Jordan** (farm boy finds out he's magic jesus, everyone in the world fights and manipulates to get him on their side)  
**Gardens of the Moon - Steven Erikson** (Malazan Empire books, really complicated both verbally and plotwise, hard not to spoil.  Its about war, and it spans over generations of conflict.)  
**Rainwilde Chronicles and Liveship Traders - Robin Hobb** (origin stories of magic and dragons in the world, mostly a swampy area, followed by pirate adventures.  Warning, there are some dark tones with one plotline in the second series.)

Honorable mention: **The Dark Tower - Stephen King** (great horror author, pretty good fantasy author.  This is a fun series that makes a few missteps in pacing and tone, but still worth a read.  Has a gunslinger, which is cool for fantasy.)

# ""Classic"" Fantasy (older often overlooked books, mostly written pre-1990, but impactful and aged well)

**Discworld - Terry Pratchet** (my personal favorite series.  There are a million books to read, and most are self contained, taking place on a big flat earth.  Funny, dark, happy, these span it all.  Read them, [here's a chart to know where to start.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Discworld_Reading_Order_Guide_3.0.jpg/1200px-Discworld_Reading_Order_Guide_3.0.jpg))  
**The Crystal Cave - Mary Stuart** (Arthurian legend origin story revolving around Merlin's childhood.  Makes you think a lot, good worldbuilding)  
**Earthsea - Ursula Le Guin** (ocean fantasy, different societies that are mostly iron age on a magic stretch of islands, no major continents.  Aged really well, doesn't feel dated at all)  
**Dragonflight - Anne McCaffery** (more dragons!  This is about dragonriders though, and its really good.  If you like more diverse protags, this is a great place to start)  
**The Once and Future King - TH White** (Classic King Arthur, this is the one people quote and make movies based off of, its a collection of stories written in the 1400s and updated a bit to be readable to a ""Modern 1958"" audience.)  
**The King of Elfland's Daughter - Lord Dunsany** (Love story between royalty and Fae.  Again, this is where a lot of the tropes come from.  It'll feel tropey, but they started here.)  
**A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court - Mark Twain** (Modern day guy gets transported to the past, shenangins ensue.  This ones actually pretty funny even though it gets serious at times.)  
**The Chronicles of Prydain - Lloyd Alexander** (Welsh mythology, high fantasy.  Takes place all in one kingdom where a young farm boy forest gumps his way into accidentally saving the place over and over)

Honorable mention: **Howl's Moving Castle -  Diana Wynne Jones** (VERY different from the Ghibli movie of the same name)

Anyway, there are a million more, but for must reads and classics those about do it in my opinion."

11014,q1zhz5,13,Beagle's The Last Unicorn is one of those books I come back to every few years for a reread. Simply magical writing.
11015,q1zhz5,13,Novik's Spinning Silver is also fantastic!

11018,q1zhz5,5,Also coming here to say Riftwar.
11019,q1zhz5,21,"If you want to branch out, you can see many more books in the [working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTP07TZZ2akERIm7dc9haQPlEVGilq7n49xY5z4KB6dE3Q_Kospi-Y3sK2InIh2Zstc2uZSse0QQLo-/pub) where I store my recommendations. It's a bit rough and not final-formatted - it’s a working document, after all - but there are well over 200 books in it now, in many genres. I've enjoyed every book on that list, and I add to it pretty much every day. The document also includes an eBook section with non-Amazon sources for free and pay ebooks.

You can also see [my old, more-detailed book reviews](https://www.librarything.com/profile_reviews.php?view=PMaranci) at LibraryThing for now, until I find a site that's better. I wouldn't necessarily _recommend_ all of the books I reviewed (some of them really suck), but the ones I rated highly are worth reading, I think. And some people find the negative reviews funny."
11020,q1zhz5,3,Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander
11021,q1zhz5,29,Everything by Octavia Butler
11022,q1zhz5,3,Realm of the Elderlings
11023,q1zhz5,3,"Everything from David Eddings, so The Belgariad followed by the Mallorean. And the Elenium followed by the Tamuli. Also for extra lore on the Belgariad and Mallorean, you can also get Belgarath the sorcerer, Polgara the sorceress and the Rivan Codex.

These are my personal favourites"
11024,q1zhz5,6,"To each their own, but I'm genuinely not sure how we could have read the same books. Lilah is a lot of things, but lacking flaws is not one of them."
11025,q1zhz5,5,Red Rising is amazing!
11026,q1zhz5,3,"I would include many works by Brandon Sanderson, but especially the Stormlight Archive. It is the Wheel of Time of this generation."
11027,q1zhz5,14,"Upvote for Diana Wynne Jones but I'd like to add literally every other book she ever wrote to the list - I've no idea why her name doesn't come up more often

Ditch J.k Rowling and read Jones' Chrestomanci series instead (brilliant, clever worldbuilding), and then try her Derkholm books (hilarious, satirical fantasy fun),and for a change of pace try her Dalemark Quartet (more serious, but as always brilliantly written with compelling characters). And honestly that's just a start. She's amazing

My one criticism is she has a tendency to pair up older men with underage girls, which is gross, but sadly hard to avoid in fantasy writing of that era"
11028,q1zhz5,3,Munchings and crunchings!
11029,q1zhz5,20,"It’s frustrating how often she’s forgotten, considering her influence is as visible in the genre as Tolkien and she’s damn good.

Other authors clearly don’t forget her - her signature is all over the place - but readers often don’t seem to know she exists at all."
11030,q1zhz5,5,Seconding NK Jemisin. Her short stories are also great.
11031,q1zhz5,8,"yep there are several authors i consider extremely under read that i try to plug as often as possible, and she’s definitely in that category.

the difference between leguin and the rest of my under read authors is that she’s just so…applicable to everything. intro to fantasy or sci fi, young readers or old, she’s got something valuable for everyone."
11032,q1zhz5,3,"No it’s not. For the true must reads/foundational books of the genre the list is Lord of the Rings, Earthsea, and something older - probably some version of the Arthurian legends."
11033,q1zhz5,8,"Agreed. I sometimes feel like a broken record, or one of the people who recommends The Martian in response to every single post- but I swear I’m not. She just really is that  broadly relevant.

Not only that but anyone who’s plugging Gaiman, Jemisin, Garth Nix, David Mitchell, Orson Scott Card, JK Rowling, Philip Pullman, or an entire 1/3 at least of the fantasy genre as it currently stands... is reading stuff that clearly shows her influence.

(I wish her influence was more widespread in science fiction - the part of Science fiction that I can see threads from her in is the really good stuff.)"
11034,q1zhz5,7,"If you’re into both Naomi Novik and dark academia as suggested by /u/katsnplants , Naomi Novik has her new Scholomance trilogy(second book just came out in September). It’s really good!"
11035,q1zhz5,17,Fantastic list and so good to see Barry Hughart mentioned. Bridge of Birds is an unsung classic.
11036,q1zhz5,7,Seconding the Assasin’s Apprentice series!!!
11037,q1zhz5,3,oh yeah. i just finished left hand of darkness a couple weeks ago and whoah is it good.
11038,q1zhz5,9,"My guy, you love you some fantasy! I'd like to ask your opinion about The Dark Tower series if you don't mind. My wife says it's fantasy, I say it's Sci-fi. What's your take?"
11039,q1zhz5,5,"Came here to say this. Gavriel Kay’s writing isn’t (I imagine) to everyone’s taste, but he manages to capture the emotional impact of fantasy worlds in ways I’ve not encountered in any other author."
11040,q1zhz5,5,"Holy shit, I didn't want to know this. They were keeping their adopted kid in a dog cage in their basement and beating the shit out of him. When the cops showed up they were actively beating him. One of my favorite series ever, I'll never be able to look at it the same again."
11041,q1zhz5,3,"Lol same! it almost was, the fourth book was crowd funded!"
11042,q1zhz5,3,I read the first three just in time to back it haha!
11043,q1zhz5,6,"I have to admit that I didn't get very far into the _Dark Tower_ series - as in, not even halfway through the first book. I suppose I should give it another try. As I recall, though, it seemed to fall into the category of fantasy-like books with an underlying science fiction rationale.  It was rather like Brust's _Taltos_ series, in that regard. Among others. Zelazny's amazing _Lord of Light_ is another book that **feels** like fantasy, but is actually science fiction underneath the trappings of fantasy."
11044,q1zhz5,6,"Thank you for getting back to me! I agree about the first book in the Tower series, it's boring, slow and you don't get any real feel for the story ahead. If I recall correctly, the first book is a mesh of several shorts King did so it makes a bit of sense that it's the way it is. 

 I think if you skim the first book to get to know The Gunslinger and Jake you can move straight to book two. Book two is still a bit slow but, we're talking Steven King and it takes him a few chapters of description to get to the meat of his stories. In any case I think you are correct it falls into that grey area sub-genre between Fantasy and Sci-fi. Be Well!!!!"
11045,q1zhz5,3,"I'll give it another try, then. Thanks for the tip!"
11046,q1zhz5,13,"I'm an old reader, so Harry Potter is...well, I read the series, and I like some of the movies (particularly the parts with Alan Rickman). But the books are derivative and not written well. Not to piss anyone off, but JK Rowling simply isn't a very good writer. Her style reminds me of a second-rate Agatha Christie, with the same underlying British racism that can be found in Christie's work.

Don't get me wrong, I like Agatha Christie's books. But at least she had the excuse of being born a hundred years ago, or thereabouts. Rowling, not so much.

As for your reading list, I think I already posted a link to the full recommendations file I've been working on? It's getting close to 300 books now. And I'm still adding books almost every day."
11047,q1zhz5,11,"I agree with a lot of the suggestions here but my list also has to include Robin McKinley, who I haven't seen mentioned. Her work is grounded in fairy tales and folk tales, which seem to me like the root of fantasy.  I particularly appreciate *The Hero and The Crown*, *The Blue Sword*, and *Deerskin*, but she has a number of other retellings of fairy tales that are also good, including collections of short stories. Like Tolkien she reaches back to connect with fairy tale traditions, but the stories she chooses, and the characters she focuses on are very different."
11048,q1zhz5,3,"Glad to help! I hope you find some books you love. And if you run low, there are lots more books in the [working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTP07TZZ2akERIm7dc9haQPlEVGilq7n49xY5z4KB6dE3Q_Kospi-Y3sK2InIh2Zstc2uZSse0QQLo-/pub) of recommendations that I've been working on."
11049,q1zhz5,3,"Well, different tastes I guess. I love Tolkien. If this was the world of _Fahrenheit 451_ I would **be** _The Lord of the Rings_. I reread it once or twice a year, and I get more out of it every time.

But _de gustibus non est disputandum_!"
11050,q1zhz5,3,"Oh, I forgot to mention that you can find non-Amazon links for free and pay ebooks in the ""eBooks"" section of my [working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTP07TZZ2akERIm7dc9haQPlEVGilq7n49xY5z4KB6dE3Q_Kospi-Y3sK2InIh2Zstc2uZSse0QQLo-/pub)."
11051,q1zhz5,3,Stardust
11052,q1zhz5,4,You are amazing and thank you for this list!
11053,q1zhz5,4,"Yo I know I'm late to the party but just wanted to say that list is missing some Robin Hobb, she is absolutely among the great authors of the genre. Start with Assassin's Apprentice (don't pay too much attention to the generic titles, they don't represent what the story is about) and the Farseer trilogy to see if you dig it, she writes amazing characters and I love her prose, but some people might find her pacing slow, others get frustrated with Fitz as a character but still, Realm of the Elderling series is some of the best fantasy I've read"
11054,q1zhz5,9,"I agree. Have you ever read the original draft of _Bridge of Birds_? It was very different from the published version, practically a different book altogether. Master Li was young, and Number Ten Ox was an idiot - and a very minor character. 

It was included in some omnibus editions of the trilogy as an extra."
11055,q1zhz5,3,This is amazing! welp now i need to go on a major book hunt
11056,q1zhz5,4,"Good luck! I can recommend some great used book stores in the Massachusetts and Rhode Island area, if your search takes you there. Otherwise, there are sources listed for both ebooks and physical books in the working doc that I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread."
11057,q1zhz5,4,"The most well written SFF books I've read have been the Earthsea Cycle by Ursula Le Guin. Absolute prose master. Left hand of Darkness also by her is fantastic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Octavia Butler's work is also astonishing."
11058,q1zhz5,5,"Yup. Actually ""corresponded"" with him (2 emails lol) a few years ago to ask if he ever thought he'd return to the two, but he said he felt that their story really was done. I love those books, re-read them every 2 or 3 years :)"
11059,q1zhz5,4,Wrinkle in time series.
11060,q1zhz5,5,"Finally some David Eddings mentioned. I never see his books brought up on this sub. Maybe I live under a rock, but I feel the Belgariad/Mallorean are two of the best fantasy novels out there. I especially like that it’s somewhat ‘PG’, ie- no drawn out torture or rapes, like you’d see in GRRM’s work"
11061,q1zhz5,3,"The Way of Kings is amazing, so is book 3."
11062,q1zhz5,8,Good list. Even a few on here I have not read but will check out now. However I am sad to not see Ursula K. Le Guin and The Wizard of Earthsea on your list.
11063,q1zhz5,3,The dragonlance chronicles AND the Twins Trilogy are legit fantasy stereotypes / protes because they were the first sort of thing in that genre (at least as far as I'm concerned)
11064,q1zhz5,7,Garth Nix Sabriel series? No Sword of Shannara?
11065,q1zhz5,5,Anything in the Cosmere by Sanderson! Warbreaker (a stand-alone) and the Mistborn series are also excellent.
11066,q1zhz5,3,"I was sure Ursula Le Guin was going to be mentioned, but since it wasn't, I'm guessing it's just an oversight; joining the chorus of people recommending her works."
11067,q1zhz5,5,What I love most about books is there is something for everyone. I love finding out which books people are passionate about. Guilty pleasures are fun to read. The world would be so boring of only one type of book existed.
11068,q1zhz5,3,"Absolutely! I just finished Tigana, but I started with Fionavar Tapestry and it set me on a course to read all of his books."
11069,q1zhz5,4,Terry Pratchet novels
11070,q1zhz5,3,"This is an excellent and comprehensive list. The four classics I would say are missed on here are the following: the Wheel of Time 
Series by Robert Jordan and finished by Brandon Sanderson. The Shannara Series by Terry Brooks. Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Legiun. 

Now there is also the great modern works of fantasy. Stormlight Archive and Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson. First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie. The Poppy War by R. F. Kuang. And most people would include Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller chronicles too but I personally still haven't read that one yet. It's on my reading list."
11071,q1zhz5,3,"I struggled with this series so much in my early fantasy reading to the point of not finishing the first trilogy. The  protagonist was such an annoying un-hero following my reading of Michael Moorcock's Eric of Melnibone stories and R.E Howard's Conan. Anne McCauley's Pern books, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover captured me as well. Ursula leGuin's Earthsea showed me how good fantasy could be. 

My reading over some 40 years plus has taking in many fantasy series, some outstanding and some, well, not so much. There has also been copious sci-fi and some other genres, but I will always return to good fantasy. I have seen film and small screen adoptions that ranged across the spectrum from good to travesty.  Reading the books allows me to create the vision of the world(s) and the players for myself and that is much of the joy of reading.

To circle back to the post I'm replying to - it's probably time I gave Mr Donaldson's Thomas Covenant another chance."
11072,q1zhz5,3,"Neil Gaiman is required reading, I think.

Whether you prefer Stardust, Coraline, or American Gods (that's up to you), but you gotta read some Gaiman if you like fantasy."
11073,q1zhz5,3,"Great list! 

I'd like to add Robin Hobbs realm of the Elderlings book series and Joe Abercrombies First Law series to that list, two of my absolute favorites."
11074,q1zhz5,3,Ya I get that I can churn through books when reading but I just can't read as much as I would like due to chronic medical issues. So I read when I can and supplement it with audiobooks. I do use audible but lately I've been getting books directly from authors too since I know audible isn't great to the authors with their percentages and return policies. Book funnel (an audiobook delivery and playing app) has been good for the indie market allowing authors to take more control over the process. And some authors have taken to paetreon and other platforms to allow other ways to pay for their books and audiobooks. It's a little annoying to have to rip my books off of one platform and put them into smart audiobook but it's worth it to support the authors. Especially the ones who go out of their way to ensure good narration because I know it cost them more in the short term.
11075,q1zhz5,3,"The first book The Gunslinger is my personal fave. It's that opening that draws me in every. single. time. ""The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed"", still gives me chills.. I didn't much enjoy it the first time I listened to the series but, but, but! The last three pages of the very last book changed EVERYTHING about the first book and the entire series really takes on a whole new meaning. It's an honest to God masterpiece of writing, if you can get past the first book that first time and unfortunately a lot of people can't."

There is no relief; it just continues to get worse and worse as you go. I love it though.  It's one of my favorite books.  I would recommend giving yourself a day to recuperate after you read it though, if it's the first time.

&gt;NOS4A2 is a spine-tingling novel of supernatural suspense from master of horror Joe Hill, the New York Times bestselling author of Heart-Shaped Box and Horns.
&gt;
&gt;Victoria McQueen has a secret gift for finding things: a misplaced bracelet, a missing photograph, answers to unanswerable questions. On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether it’s across Massachusetts or across the country.
&gt;
&gt;Charles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing – and terrifying – playground of amusements he calls “Christmasland.”
&gt; 
&gt;Then, one day, Vic goes looking for trouble—and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manx’s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. He’s on the road again and he’s picked up a new passenger: Vic’s own son.

&gt;'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit.
&gt;
&gt;But not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.
&gt;
&gt;But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say ""Kris Kringle,"" he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.

Adam Kay - *Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas*, festive diary entries from a former doctor and the author of *This is Going to Hurt*. ""*This is a love letter to all those who spend their festive season on the front line, removing babies and baubles from the various places they get stuck, at the most wonderful time of the year.*"""
11279,q2impk,6,So good!  Definitely this one OP!
11280,q2impk,3,Came here to say this. I really enjoyed this book.
11281,q2impk,4,Came here to say this!!!
11282,q2impk,4,"I think one is a subset of the other, with Holidays on Ice containing more stories. But it's hard to find details on which stories each one has."
11283,q2impk,7,"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever!  It’s kind of a kids’ book, and it’s very much set in the 50’s, but I read it to my kids but really for me at Christmastime.  It’s an old-fashioned “hardcore” response to the usual “nice pageant story.”

And on a totally different note, Connie Willis, an excellent sci-if writer, has an amazing collection of Christmas stories called “Miracle and Other Christmas Stories,” which is “full of the spirit of Christmas” with more sharp peppermint than cloying sweetness and NO sentimentality!  Highly recommended.  And I’m looking up the title to be sure I got it right, I discovered that she’s putting out another Christmas story collection later this month… I can’t wait!!"
11284,q2impk,3,"One of my all-time favorite books ever - but not a light read, FYI.  Heart wrenching."
11285,q2impk,4,Came here hoping this was already recommended and glad to see it has been!
11286,q2impk,3,"There's a movie, and it's a lot of fun."
11287,q2impk,3,"They usually stand alone fine. You'd probably be missing why this woman is calling Death ""Grandfather,"" but they kind of explain it briefly and then get on with it."

&gt;
&gt;  For men like us, trust doesn't come easy.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In this village, I’m an outcast: Griffin Everett, the scowling giant who prefers plants to people. Then I meet Keynes, a stranger from the city who’s everything I’m not: sharp-tongued, sophisticated, beautiful. Free. For a few precious moments in a dark alleyway, he’s also mine, hot and sweet under the stars… until he crushes me like dirt beneath his designer boot.
&gt;
&gt;When the prettiest man I’ve ever hated shows up at my job the next day, I’m not sure if I want to strangle him or drag him into bed. Actually—I think I want both. But Keynes isn’t here for the likes of me: he makes that painfully clear. With everyone else at work, he’s all gorgeous, glittering charm—but when I get too close, he turns vicious.
&gt;
&gt;And yet, I can’t stay away. Because there’s something about this ice king that sets me on fire, a secret vulnerability that makes my chest ache. I’ll do whatever it takes to sneak past his walls and see the real man again.
&gt;
&gt;The last thing I expect is for that man to ruin me.

* A Game of Fate by Scarlett St. Clair (again, a retelling of A Touch of Darkness but from Hades' POV)."
11295,q2kezx,10,Loved this book and it’s sequel!

[NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/books/midnight-sun-stephenie-meyer-twilight.html)"
11299,q2kezx,10,"Penny Reid's books typically switch between male and female POV during the course of a story; her [Winston Brothers](https://www.goodreads.com/series/138234) series is my favorite.    
She's writing into a realistic metaverse so characters from all her books tend to show up in other books; side characters are later protagonists so if you like her style, there is a lot to read. It's adult romance with wit and charm, occasional math jokes, and a lot of heart."
11300,q2kezx,15,They're great! The first couple books are better than the latter couple but still fun and humorous throughout (definitely smutty).
11301,q2kezx,9,Priest by Sierra Simone. The whole series is male POV and it’s wonderful.
11302,q2kezx,3,Thx a lot
11303,q2kezx,44,Song of Achilles and its amazing.
11304,q2kezx,3,"So it's not what you would classically put in the paperback romance novel genre, but Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" is on of the best ""male POV"" stories about relationships - that being said, i would concede it's less a romance and more an exploration of neuroses and uncertainty and what relationships are and what they're for, and trying to balance toxic masculinity and happiness."
11305,q2kezx,5,Came here to suggest this one too!
11306,q2kezx,4,"If you like your romance YA with a side of magic, the Simon Snow series is... pretty good. I'm not going to say it's perfect but there are three books, they are all pretty quick reads, and there is M/M romance from a M POV. I'm on the last one now. Start with {{Carry On by Rainbow Rowell}}"
11307,q2kezx,3,The “Shiver” series swaps between the female and male protagonists for each chapter. That may be something you’re interested in 😊
11308,q2kezx,5,"{{The flatshare}} has alternating male and female POVs, and quite a cute enjoyable love story"
11309,q2kezx,3,"It's not a romance per se, but I would say The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon

11311,q2kezx,11,Halfway through The House in the Cerulean Sea and it's hurting my heart with comfort and sweetness ( crossing my fingers it keeps it up). Excited to discover more of Klune's work!
11312,q2kezx,4,"If you are interested in a LGBT romance, A Place Called Winter by Patrick Gale"
11313,q2kezx,3,Prince of Shadows by Rachel Caine-  retelling of shakspear romoe and Juliet told in pov of Benvolio. One of my favorite slow burn with Rosaline in a guy pov and I never even liked to read in a guy pov so this was a nice change
11314,q2kezx,6,"Was just about to recommend them. Right now there are 2-3 books in the series. I have only read the first, but I loved it. I give it the male-pov-romance seal of approval"
11315,q2kezx,3,"A Civil Campaign by Lois McMaster Bujold. It’s dropping you into the middle of a SF series but it’s dedicated to the queens of romance writing.  Mostly male point of view but, honestly, multiple narrators. (Maybe not close enough!)"
11316,q2kezx,3,"Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami is from a male perspective &amp; offers some really emotionally impactful themes around love and relationships, though I don’t know if I would call it a romance book."
11317,q2kezx,5,"I'll second the recommendation by /u/Saintbaba for Nick Hornby.  ""High Fidelity"" is his best known work.  But I also really enjoyed ""About a Boy.""  Both have been made into movies.  

Another similar recommendation would be Plan B, by Jonathan Tropper.  

A lot of Hornby and Tropper's work is probably guy romance, but they're really about guys in their late 20s/early 30s trying to figure out their place in the world, and finding a relationship in the course of doing so."
11318,q2kezx,6,Didn't know that it had a sequel.
11319,q2kezx,3,I've got that one on my list but it's gonna be a bit because all my library books came in at once
11320,q2kezx,5,The entire series is amazing but I do have to give you a Content warning because it is extremely dark BDSM
11321,q2kezx,3,It’s called The Rosie Effect. ☺️
11322,q2kezx,5,Good call. I should have cautioned OP initially.
11323,q2kezx,4,And a third book called The Rosie Result. I just finished yesterday in fact. They’re such fun books😁
11324,q2kezx,3,Can confirm it's truly heartwarming and wonderful to read.

11326,q2oxt0,15,"You like a lot of the same books my son enjoyed.  Based on that you might also like Ender's Game, The Martian, Steelheart, and Dune

Edited to add: Skyward as well."

11328,q2oxt0,3,Three Dark Crowns series by Kendare Blake.
11329,q2oxt0,23,"A deadly education by Naomi novik and the Abhorsen series by Garth Nix. Neither have significant romance, both series have young but capable protagonist, lots of magic, mystery, danger and monsters."
11330,q2oxt0,35,"you might like 'Six of Crows' by Leigh Bardugo

edit: also try 'The Summoner' series by Taran Matharu, also very good"

All Tamora Pierce books.

11332,q2oxt0,13,Ender's game and Eragon are my recommendations
11333,q2oxt0,10,The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. A lovely mystery book starring both young and older characters. Lots of wordplay. One of my favorites :)
11334,q2oxt0,4,Legendborn by Tracy Deonn
11335,q2oxt0,4,Looks like the Divergent series is a good fit for you. Agree with the Abhorsen and Ender’s Game suggestions as well.

Works of art"
11340,q2oxt0,3,"From the top of my head,

The lightbringer series - Brent weeks
First book - The Black Prism

The book of the ancestor series - Mark lawrence 
First book - red sister

The moontide quartet - David Hair
First book - Mage’s blood.

The wheel of time

Eragon."
11341,q2oxt0,9,"The first three books of Garth Nix' Abhorsen series are awesome.  I love the narration by Tim Curry, who may not mean much to you, but was a real treat for me.  He does not narrate the next two, and they are not quite as good, but those first 3 I will listen to again.

{{Sabriel}}"

&gt;Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child, Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom. But during her final semester, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing, and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him. 
&gt;
&gt;With Sabriel, the first installment in the Abhorsen series, Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star, in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isn't always clear—and sometimes disappears altogether.

11343,q2oxt0,10,"You may also want to try the Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud. I enjoyed those books, they're more young adult than children's books. 


If you like Wings of Fire, Warrior Cats is a similar type of series but with cats. They're never going to win literary prizes, but they were quite entertaining."
11344,q2oxt0,6,I loved Tamora Pierce!
11345,q2oxt0,3,I would try the Divergent series if you enjoyed The Hunger Games!
11346,q2oxt0,22,His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman.
11347,q2oxt0,3,Children of Blood and Bone
11348,q2oxt0,5,I have read and re read these. Amazing books. Solid magic system.
11349,q2oxt0,3,"The Simon Snow trilogy by Rainbow Rowell; first book is *Carry On*

The Peter Whimsey series by Dorothy Sayers; a contemporary of Agatha Christie. *Whose Body?* is the first in the series.

If you like your adventure in military strategy and space opera flavors the Vorkosigan series by Bujold is a winner. Each book can be read as a standalone; I'd recommend starting with *Warrior's Apprentice.*

The DiscWorld series by Terry Pratchett is another series of standalones; these are comic fantasy. *Guards! Guards!* is a good starting point."
11350,q2oxt0,25,A few people have mentioned the Inheritance series. Absolutely try that. Artemis Fowl. Skullduggery Pleasant. Dresden Files. Furies of Calderon.
11351,q2oxt0,9,Seconding the Abhorsen series!
11352,q2oxt0,3,I love the Green Rider books and all Tamora Pierce (I’d recommend starting with Alanna first)!
11353,q2oxt0,4,Second for {{Artemis Fowl}} by Eoin Colfer and the Codex Alera (aka {{Furies of Calderon}} ) by Jim Butcher.
11354,q2oxt0,3,"There are tons of great young adult books out there. I’m far past that age, but read them with my nieces so that we can discuss them. Somebody already suggested Tamora Pierce, and the Alanna series and Immortal series are perennial fantasy favorites of my extended family. Here are some other top picks:

{{The Gilded Ones by Namina Forna}}

{{Sabriel by Garth Nix}}

{{Over Sea, Under Stone by Susan Cooper}}

{{The Paper Magician by Charlie Holmberg}}

{{Cinder by Melissa Meyer}}

{{Paranormalcy by Kiersten White}}

{{We Hunt The Flame by Hafsah Faizel}}

There really are quite a few other enjoyable ones. Patricia Wrede: all of Wrede’s books are charming. I love the regency era so I favored the Sorcery and Cecelia books, but my nieces prefer the dragons in the Enchanted Forest series. Leigh Bardugo’s books (probably want to start with Shadow and Bone although the a Six of Crows duology is better}}. Richelle Mead (Vampire academy and the connected Bloodlines series).  Robin LaFevars His Fair Assasin series (historical magic realism). Alys Arden’s Cassquette Girls series (vampires and witches in NOLA). Holly Black, Rosamund Hodge, and Sarah Fine each have some stand out books too. I could probably go on, but I’ll leave it here. Happy Reading!"
11355,q2oxt0,4,"Cirque Du Freak series by Darren Shan, the Gone series by Michael Grant"
11356,q2oxt0,6,"If you liked Harry Potter, you will probably like the Tiffany Aching books by Terry Pratchett, 1st book THE WEE FREE MEN.  I was in my fifties when I read it and I found it to be totally enchanting.  Tiffany is 9 years  old when the Elf Queen steals her annoying little brother.  She knows none of the loving adults in her life will believe her.  So armed with an iron frying pan, and with the help of a toad who used to be a lawyer and the Wee Free Men, a tribe of 6 inch tall, red haired, blue tattooed Pictsies, she enters the land of Faery, saves her brother and becomes a witch in the process.  There are 5 Tiffany Aching books.  And if you enjoyed those, there is the rest of the Discworld books."

11358,q2oxt0,3,"Anything by Diana Wynne Jones. The Chronicles of Chrestomanci and the Howl's Moving Castle trilogy are fantastic, but so are all her other books. 
I also second anything by Terry Pratchett, the Abhorsen series, and His Dark Materials."

The Name of This Book is Secret by Pseudonymous Bosch and the other books in the series

The Red Blazer Girls series, especially if you're into Nancy Drew

From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler by E.L. Konigsburg

The Calder Game, Chasing Vermeer, and The Wright 3 all by Blue Balliett

The Boxcar Children series, one of the absolute best children's mystery series

the prequel series to The Mortal Instruments, The Infernal Devices. you can ignore TMI and just read TID, it's far better and doesn't have incest. i will say romance is one of the bigger plot points but it's enjoyable and doesn't detract too much from the main plot. 

Flame in the Mist by Renee Ahdieh; i never finished the series because i don't think the following books were published when i read this one but i know i loved this book 

i had incredibly similar interests to yours in literature back when i was super into reading all the time. i would recommend more but my list is already quite long and there are so many other good recommendations. hope you find one you like!"

It's a series with book 4 due soon and she us pumping them out rather quickly.

Female 11 year old lead.

Fantastical world that you discover with the protagonist.

People are not black and white,but seem real and have agendas you can follow and understand.

Deals with themes like death and racism in an understandable manner, while being enjoyable for children and grown ups alike. (I am 32 and love it!)

This seriesis my new holy grail,aspirational as a writer and it is so much better than Harry Potter. Those books are on point. I love them."
11369,q2oxt0,5,"You might like the {{The Trials of Morrigan Crow}}. There are currently three books in the Nevermoor series, with plans of another trilogy. I have read and enjoy the books on your list and found this series to be a fun read. I particularly like magic in school settings.

Another book to check out is {{The House in the Cerulean Sea}}. This is my favorite book I read this year. But The 7 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle might end up taking that spot..."
